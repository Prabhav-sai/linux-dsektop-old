      "Israeli warplanes struck targets across Gaza early Monday, including in areas where Palestinian civilians have been told to seek refuge, after another small aid shipment was allowed into the besieged Hamas-ruled territory.Israel is widely expected to launch a ground offensive in Gaza following Hamas' brutal October 7 rampage into southern Israeli communities.Tanks and troops have been massed at the Gaza border, and Israel says it has stepped up airstrikes in order to reduce the risk to troops in the next stages.Fears of a widening war have grown as Israeli warplanes have struck targets in the occupied West Bank, Syria and Lebanon in recent days.It has frequently traded fire with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group, which is armed with tens of thousands of rockets.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told troops in northern Israel on Sunday that if Hezbollah launches a war, \"it will make the mistake of its life. We will cripple it with a force it cannot even imagine, and the consequences for it and the Lebanese state will be devastating.”More than 1,400 people in Israel have been killed — mostly civilians slain during the initial Hamas attack.At least 212 people were captured and dragged back to Gaza. Two Americans were released Friday, hours before the first shipment of humanitarian aid.More than 4,600 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry. That includes the disputed toll from a hospital explosion.Israel has carried out limited ground forays into Gaza, and on Sunday, Hamas said it had destroyed an Israeli tank and two armoured bulldozers inside the territory it has ruled since 2007.The Israeli military said a soldier was killed and three others were wounded by an anti-tank missile during a raid inside Gaza.The military said the raid was part of efforts to rescue hostages abducted in the October 7 attack. Hamas hopes to trade the captives for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.On Saturday, 20 trucks entered Gaza in the first aid shipment into the territory since Israel imposed a complete siege at the start of the war.Israel allowed a second convoy of 15 trucks into Gaza on Sunday. Both entered from Egypt through the Rafah crossing, the only way into Gaza not controlled by Israel.COGAT, the Israeli defence body responsible for Palestinian civilian affairs, said the aid was allowed in at the request of the United States, and included water, food and medical supplies. It said everything was inspected by Israel before it was brought into Gaza.In a Sunday phone call, Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden “affirmed that there will now be continued flow of this critical assistance into Gaza,” the White House said in a statement.Relief workers said far more aid was needed to address the spiralling humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where half the territory's 2.3 million people have fled their homes.The UN humanitarian agency said the 20 trucks that entered Saturday amounted to 4 per cent of an average day's imports before the war and “a fraction of what is needed after 13 days of complete siege.”The Israeli military said the humanitarian situation was “under control,” even as the UN called for 100 trucks a day to enter.Israel has not allowed any fuel to enter Gaza, where there has been a full power blackout for more than a week and where hospitals say they are scrounging for generator fuel in order to keep operating life-saving medical equipment and incubators for premature babies.The World Health Organisation said seven hospitals in northern Gaza have been forced to shut down due to damage from strikes, lack of power and supplies, or Israeli evacuation orders.The lack of fuel has also crippled water and sanitation systems. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians sheltering in UN-run schools and tent camps are running low on food and are drinking dirty water.Israel repeated its calls for people to leave northern Gaza, including by dropping leaflets from the air. It estimated 700,000 have already fled.But hundreds of thousands remain. That would raise the risk of mass civilian casualties in any ground offensive.Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Israel “can't go back to the status quo” in which Hamas controls Gaza and is able to threaten it, but that Israel has “absolutely no intent” to govern Gaza itself.“Something needs to be found that ensures that Hamas can't do this again, but that also doesn't revert to Israeli governance of Gaza,” he told NBC's “Meet the Press” on Sunday.“It's something that needs to be worked even as Israel is dealing with the current threat.”Israel captured Gaza, along with the West Bank and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for a future state.Israel withdrew troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005, but Israel and Egypt have imposed a blockade of varying degrees since Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007.Heavy Israeli airstrikes and shelling continued overnight across Gaza, the Hamas-run Interior Ministry said.It said airstrikes hit residential apartments in the town of Khan Younis and the Nuseirat refugee camp, both of which are south of the evacuation line.The Palestinian Red Crescent medical service reported heavy overnight airstrikes near al-Quds hospital in Gaza City. Aside from patients, the hospital houses more than 12,000 displaced people, it said.The Israeli military says it does not target civilians. It says Palestinian militants have fired over 7,000 rockets at Israel since the start of the war.The military said Monday that it had struck 320 militant targets throughout Gaza over the last 24 hours.It said it had destroyed anti-tank positions and other targets that could endanger forces preparing for “a maneuver in the Gaza Strip,” an apparent reference to a ground operation.\n",

      "A 71-year-old Illinois man accused of fatally stabbing a 6-year-old boy and seriously wounding a 32-year-old woman was charged with a hate crime Sunday. Police allege he singled out the victims because of their Islamic faith and as a response to the war between Israel and Hamas.In recent days, police in US cities and federal authorities have been on high alert for violence driven by antisemitic or Islamophobic sentiments. FBI officials, along with Jewish and Muslim groups, have reported an increase of hateful and threatening rhetoric.In the Chicago-area case, officers found the woman and boy late Saturday morning at a home in an unincorporated area of Plainfield Township, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) southwest of Chicago, the Will County Sheriff's Office said in a statement on social media.The boy was pronounced dead at a hospital. The woman had multiple stab wounds and was expected to survive, according to the statement. An autopsy on the child showed he had been stabbed dozens of times.“Detectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the on-going Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis,” the sheriff's statement said.According to the Will County sheriff's office, the woman had called 911 to report that her landlord had attacked her with a knife, adding she then ran into a bathroom and continued to fight him off.The man suspected in the attack was found Saturday outside the home and “sitting upright outside on the ground near the driveway of the residence” with a cut on his forehead, authorities said.Joseph M. Czuba of Plainfield was charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, two counts of hate crimes and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, according to the sheriff's office. He was in custody Sunday and awaiting a court appearance.Attempts to reach Czuba or a family member were unsuccessful Sunday. His home phone number was unlisted. Messages left for possible relatives in online records and on social media were not immediately returned. The sheriff's office and county public defender's office did not immediately return messages about Czuba's legal representation.Authorities did not release the names of the two victims.But the boy's paternal uncle, Yousef Hannon, spoke at a news conference Sunday hosted by the Chicago chapter Council on American-Islamic Relations. There the boy was identified as Wadea Al-Fayoume, a Palestinian American boy who recently had turned 6. The organisation identified the other victim as the boy's mother.“We are not animals, we are humans. We want people to see us as humans, to feel us as humans, to deal with us as humans, because this is what we are,” said Hannon, a Palestinian American who emigrated to the U.S. In 1999 to work, including as a public school teacher.The Muslim civil liberties organisation called the crime “our worst nightmare” and part of a disturbing spike in hate calls and emails since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war. The group cited text messages exchanged among family members that showed the attacker had made disparaging remarks about Muslims.“Palestinians basically, again, with their hearts broken over what's happening to their people,” said Ahmed Rehab, the group's executive director, “have to also worry about the immediate safety of life and limb living here in this most free of democracies in the world.\"In response to the increased threats, the Illinois State Police are communicating with federal law-enforcement and reaching out to Muslim communities and religious leaders to offer support, according to a Sunday press release from Illinois Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker.“To take a six-year-old child's life in the name of bigotry is nothing short of evil,\" Pritzker said. \"Wadea should be heading to school in the morning. Instead, his parents will wake up without their son. This wasn't just a murder — it was a hate crime. And every single Illinoisan — including our Muslim, Jewish, and Palestinian neighbors — deserves to live free from the threat of such evil.”President Joe Biden echoed that sentiment Sunday, saying in a statement: “This horrific act of hate has no place in America, and stands against our fundamental values: freedom from fear for how we pray, what we believe, and who we are.”FBI Director Chris Wray said on a call with reporters Sunday that the FBI is also moving quickly to mitigate the threats.A senior FBI official who spoke on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Bureau said the majority of the threats that the FBI has responded to were not judged to be credible, adding that the FBI takes them all seriously nonetheless.The official also said that agents have been encouraged to be “aggressive” and proactive in communicating over the last week with faith-based leaders. The official said the purpose is not to make anyone feel targeted but rather to ask clerics and others to report to law enforcement anything that seems suspicious.\n",

      "The list reads 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2019, 2021, and now 2023.Lionel Messi won the men's Ballon d'Or for a record-extending eighth time on Monday after fulfilling his life's ambition by leading Argentina to the World Cup title in Qatar last year.Adding to his silverware the one major trophy that eluded him in his storied career was the decisive factor in an otherwise quite mundane season — for his standards — at Paris Saint-Germain.The 36-year-old Messi won ahead of Manchester City forward Erling Haaland and his former PSG teammate Kylian Mbappe.Messi thanked his Argentina coach, teammates and staff for making his victory possible.\"Tonight I'm enjoying myself. It's a pleasure that will never leave me, and I hope to be able to enjoy it for many years to come,\" Messi said through a translator.\"Becoming world champion was the title we were missing. I'd like to thank everyone who helped make Argentina the world champion team.\"Messi also paid tribute to the late Diego Maradona, who also helped Argentina win the World Cup, back in 1986.\"This title and this trophy,\" Messi said, \"I share them with you and all our Argentina comrades.\"Aitana Bonmati won the women's award for guiding Spain to victory at the Women's World Cup in August. She also helped Barcelona win the Women's Champions League and Spanish league.A year after missing out on the shortlist for the 2022 Ballon d'Or, and despite leaving top-level European soccer behind, Messi has recovered his crown.He won the sport's biggest individual prize due to his tremendous World Cup. In Qatar, Messi was involved in 10 goals for Argentina, scoring seven and assisting three. He scored twice in the final against France.His final season with PSG was less shiny. Although PSG won a record-extending 11th French league, it again exited the Champions League in the round of 16.Nobody else has won more than five Ballon d'Or. Cristiano Ronaldo has five, and Michel Platini, Johan Cruyff and Marco van Basten each won it three times.Since moving to Inter Miami in the United States, Messi has already picked up his first silverware there by inspiring the team to victory in the U.S. Leagues Cup.Messi's latest win marked the first time a Major League Soccer-based player got such recognition. Messi received the trophy from former Manchester United star David Beckham, who is one of the owners of his new club.\"I'm very happy with the decisions I've made and to be with Miami,\" Messi said.He succeeded Karim Benzema.Mbappe hoped another Frenchman could win the Ballon d'Or after he scored a hat trick in the World Cup final, though France lost in a penalty shootout.Haaland led City to a treble of trophies last season — Champions League, English Premier League, FA Cup — while scoring 52 goals.Bonmati had already been awarded UEFA best women's player and the Golden Ball for the top Women's World Cup player. She scored three times and assisted twice at the tournament.She followed in the footsteps of her teammate Alexia Putellas, who took the past two awards.Bonmati won ahead of Sam Kerr and Salma Paralluelo.\"We are a country that lives football, intensely,” Bonmati said. “We have a unique talent in Spain.\"For the first time last year, the trophy awarded by France Football magazine was based on achievements from the past season. It was previously awarded based on performances through a calendar year. Stanley Matthews won the first Ballon d'Or in 1956.The women's trophy was created in 2018, and both were cancelled in 2020 because of the pandemic.In other awards, the best under-21 player was Jude Bellingham, while Haaland won the Gerd Müller award for the best striker of the year.The Lev Yashin award for best goalkeeper went to Emiliano Martinez. In addition to his trophy, the Argentina goalkeeper collected boos and whistles from the audience at the Theatre du Chatelet that included Mbappe and France coach Didier Deschamps.Martinez was criticized for the excessive tone of his World Cup celebrations. He carried a doll with Mbappe's face on it while standing alongside teammate Messi as Argentina paraded the trophy back home. Martinez, who also made a crude gesture after winning the Golden Glove award for best goalkeeper, was filmed mocking Mbappe in the team dressing room after the game. \n",

      "Israel's military directed the evacuation on Friday of all of the hundreds of thousands of civilians living in Gaza City ahead of a feared Israel ground offensive. The directive came on the heels of what the United Nations said was a warning they received from Israel to evacuate 1.1 million people living in the north of Gaza within 24 hours.The Israeli military order, which comes on the seventh day of a war declared by Israel following an unprecedented Hamas incursion and deadly attack, directs residents of Gaza City to flee deeper south into the Gaza Strip, a narrow coastal territory. Israel's directive charged that Hamas militants were hiding in tunnels under the city.“This is chaos, no one understands what to do,” said Inas Hamdan, an officer at the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency in Gaza City while she grabbed whatever she could throw into her bags as the panicked shouts of her relatives could be heard around her. She said all the U.N. Staff in Gaza City and northern Gaza had been told to evacuate south to Rafah.“This evacuation is for your own safety,” the Israeli military said, in a warning it said was sent to Gaza City civilians.The flurry of directives could signal an impending ground offensive, though the Israeli military has not yet confirmed such a move. On Thursday it said that while it was preparing, no decision has been made.Israel delivered an even broader evacuation order — giving almost half of tiny Gaza's population 24 hours to flee to the territory's south — to the U.N., spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. The Israeli military did not immediately confirm the broader evacuation order.The broad order for all of Gaza's north also applies to all U.N. Staff and to the hundreds of thousands who have taken shelter in U.N. Schools and other facilities since Israel launched round-the-clock airstrikes Saturday.“The United Nations considers it impossible for such a movement to take place without devastating humanitarian consequences,” Dujarric said.“The United Nations strongly appeals for any such order, if confirmed, to be rescinded avoiding what could transform what is already a tragedy into a calamitous situation,” the spokesman said.Another U.N. Official said that the United Nation is trying to get clarity from Israeli officials at the senior most political level.“It's completely unprecedent,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak publicly.Panicked rumors of an evacuation had begun to spread in north Gaza in the early morning Friday.A ground offensive in Gaza, which is ruled by Hamas and where the population is densely packed into a sliver of land only 40 kilometers (25 miles) long, would likely bring even higher casualties on both sides in brutal house-to-house fighting.Hamas' assault Saturday and smaller attacks since have killed more than 1,300 people in Israel, including 247 soldiers — a toll unseen in Israel for decades — and the ensuing Israeli bombardment has killed more than 1,530 people in Gaza, according to authorities on both sides.Israel says roughly 1,500 Hamas militants were killed inside Israel, and that hundreds of the dead in Gaza are Hamas members. Thousands have been wounded on both sides.As Israel pounds Gaza from the air, Hamas militants have fired thousands of rockets into Israel. Amid concerns that the fighting could spread in the region, Syrian state media reported that Israeli airstrikes on Thursday put two Syrian international airports out of service.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to “crush” Hamas after the militants stormed into the country's south on Saturday and massacred hundreds of people, including killings of children in their homes and young people at a music festival.Amid grief and demands for vengeance among the Israeli public, the government is under intense pressure to topple Hamas rather than continuing to try to bottle it up in Gaza.The number of people forced from their homes by Israel's airstrikes soared 25 per cent in a day, reaching 423,000 out of a population of 2.3 million, the U.N. Said Thursday.On Thursday, the Israeli military pulverized the Gaza Strip with airstrikes, prepared for a possible ground invasion and said its complete siege of the territory — which has left Palestinians desperate for food, fuel and medicine — would remain in place until Hamas militants free some 150 hostages taken during their grisly weekend incursion.A visit by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, along with shipments of U.S. Weapons, offered a powerful green light to Israel to drive ahead with its retaliation in Gaza after Hamas' deadly attack on civilians and soldiers, even as international aid groups warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis. Israel has halted deliveries of basic necessities and electricity to Gaza's 2.3 million people and prevented entry of supplies from Egypt.“Not a single electricity switch will be flipped on, not a single faucet will be turned on and not a single fuel truck will enter until the Israeli hostages are returned home,” Israeli Energy Minister Israel Katz said on social media.Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesman, told reporters Thursday that forces “are preparing for a ground maneuver” should political leaders order one.\n",

      "Israel has been badly victimised, but it should explore the opportunity to relieve the suffering of people in Gaza who have nowhere to go, US President Joe Biden said following his trip to Israel. “Look, Israel has been badly victimised. But the truth is that if they have an opportunity to relieve the suffering of people who have nowhere to go, it’s what they should do. And if they don't, they'll be held accountable in ways that may be unfair,” Biden told reporters aboard Air Force One on his way back from Israel on Wednesday. “And my point to everyone is, look, if you have an opportunity to alleviate the pain, you should do it, period. And if you don't, you're going to lose credibility worldwide. And I think everyone understands that,” Biden said after he spent several hours in Israel in the aftermath of the terrorist strike from Hamas.Israel is likely planning retaliation and a possible ground invasion of Gaza against Hamas for its October 7 attack that killed around 1,400 people in Israel.The US has asked for massive humanitarian aid for the people of Gaza and is in the process of providing defence military assistance to Israel.Biden said Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi agreed to open up the Rafah gate to allow up to 20 trucks of humanitarian assistance into Gaza. “If Hamas confiscates them or doesn’t let it get through … then it’s going to end,” he said. “The bottom line is Sisi deserves a lot of credit,” he added.The White House, in a readout of the phone call between the two leaders, said Biden and Al-Sisi discussed ongoing coordination to deliver humanitarian assistance to Gaza and mechanisms to ensure the aid is distributed for the benefit of the civilian population.“The two leaders agreed to work together closely on encouraging an urgent and robust international response to the UN’s humanitarian appeal. They agreed on the need to preserve stability in the Middle East, prevent escalation of the conflict, and set the circumstances for a durable, permanent peace in the region,” the White House said.On his way back from Israel, Biden was asked about the odds of Israeli forces launching a ground invasion of Gaza. “We had a long talk about that and what alternatives there are. Our military is talking with their military about what the alternatives are, but I’m not going to go into that, either,” the president said.The US president added that he found Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu receptive to the humanitarian aid argument.“Well, we've had a number of discussions on this. I don't know what you picked up in Israel, but I got no pushback. Virtually none. Let me say it again. I got no pushback. (from) All the partners, virtually none. I'm hopeful we can get some Americans out as well of Gaza and I'm hopeful we can continue to work toward getting other Americans out through other means as well,” Biden said\n",

      "Terrorism is a \"malignancy\" and knows no borders, nationality or race and the world should not buy into any justification of terror acts, India has told the UN General Assembly as it abstained on a resolution on the Israel-Hamas conflict.India on Friday abstained in the UN General Assembly on a Jordanian-drafted resolution titled ‘Protection of civilians and upholding legal and humanitarian obligations' that called for an immediate humanitarian truce in the Israel-Hamas conflict and unhindered humanitarian access in the Gaza strip.The 193-member General Assembly adopted the resolution that called for an immediate, durable and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities.The resolution, which garnered 121 votes in favour, 44 abstentions and 14 member states voting against it, also demanded the immediate, continuous, sufficient and unhindered provision of essential goods and services to civilians throughout the Gaza Strip.India's Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Yojna Patel, in Explanation of Vote here said in a world where differences and disputes should be resolved by dialogue, this august body should be deeply concerned at recourse to violence.\"That too, when it happens on a scale and intensity that is an affront to basic human values,” Patel said.Patel said that violence as a means to achieve political objectives damages indiscriminately and does not pave the way for any durable solutions.Describing the terror attacks in Israel on October 7 as shocking, Patel said they deserve condemnation. India's explanation of the vote did not mention Hamas.“Terrorism is a malignancy and knows no borders, nationality or race. The world should not buy into any justification of terror acts. Let us keep aside differences, unite and adopt a zero-tolerance approach to terrorism,” she said.India expressed hope that the deliberations of the General Assembly will “send a clear message against terror and violence and expand prospects for diplomacy and dialogue while addressing the humanitarian crisis that confronts us.”Patel said India is “deeply concerned” at the deteriorating security situation and astounding loss of civilian lives in the ongoing conflict.“The escalation of hostilities in the region will only exacerbate the humanitarian crisis. It is necessary for all parties to display the utmost responsibility,” she said. India also called for the “immediate and unconditional release” of the hostages.Earlier, Iraq had abstained on the resolution but later changed its vote to a yes citing “a technical problem” at the time of voting. Countries voting against the resolution included Israel and the US. China, France, and Russia voted in favour of the resolution while Canada, Germany, Japan, Ukraine and the UK abstained.The resolution called for immediate, full, sustained, safe and unhindered humanitarian access for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and other United Nations humanitarian agencies and their implementing partners, the International Committee of the Red Cross and all other humanitarian organisations upholding humanitarian principles and delivering urgent assistance to civilians in the Gaza Strip.It encourages the establishment of humanitarian corridors and other initiatives to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to civilians and welcomes efforts on this.Patel stressed that casualties in the ongoing conflict in Gaza are a telling, serious and continuing concern and it is civilians, especially women and children, who are paying with their lives.“This humanitarian crisis needs to be addressed,” Patel said, welcoming the international community's de-escalation efforts and delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza.She noted that India too has contributed to this effort. India has sent 38 tons of humanitarian goods, including medicines and equipment to the people of Palestine.Patel reiterated that India has always supported a negotiated two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine issue, leading to the establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable state of Palestine, living within secure and recognised borders, side by side in peace with Israel.“For this, we urge the parties to de-escalate, eschew violence and work towards creating conditions for an early resumption of direct peace negotiations,” she said.The Jordanian-drafted resolution did not make any mention of the militant group Hamas.Before the General Assembly voted on the resolution, the 193-member body considered an amendment proposed by Canada and co-sponsored by the US to the text.The amendment proposed by Canada asked for inserting a paragraph in the resolution that would state that the General Assembly “Unequivocally rejects and condemns the terrorist attacks by Hamas that took place in Israel starting on 7 October 2023 and the taking of hostages, demands the safety, well-being and humane treatment of the hostages in compliance with international law, and calls for their immediate and unconditional release.”India voted in favour of the amendment, along with 87 other nations, while 55 member states voted against and 23 abstentions.The draft amendment could not be adopted, having failed to obtain a 2/3rd majority of members present and voting.The adopted resolution called for the rescinding of the order by “Israel, the occupying Power”, for Palestinian civilians and United Nations staff, as well as humanitarian and medical workers, to evacuate all areas in the Gaza Strip north of the Wadi Gaza and relocate to southern Gaza.It also called for the immediate and unconditional release of all civilians who are being illegally held captive, demanding their safety, well-being and humane treatment in compliance with international law.It emphasised the importance of preventing further destabilisation and escalation of violence in the region and in this regard called upon all parties to exercise maximum restraint and upon all those with influence on them to work toward this objective.Meanwhile, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres voiced deep concern at the humanitarian system in Gaza, saying it is facing a total collapse with unimaginable consequences for more than 2 million civilians.Guterres noted that about 500 trucks per day were crossing into Gaza before the hostilities began but in recent days, an average of only 12 trucks per day have entered, despite needs being far greater than at any time before. Further, the supplies that have trickled in do not include fuel for United Nations operations.“Given the desperate and dramatic situation, the United Nations will not be able to continue to deliver inside Gaza without an immediate and fundamental shift in how aid is going in,” Guterres said.He added that the verification system for the movement of goods through the Rafah crossing must be adjusted to allow many more trucks to enter Gaza without delay.Guterres underscored that life-saving humanitarian aid – food, water, medicine, fuel – must be allowed to reach all civilians swiftly, safely and at scale.“Misery is growing by the minute. Without a fundamental change, the people of Gaza will face an unprecedented avalanche of human suffering,” the UN chief said.\n",

      "US President Joe Biden will travel to Israel on Wednesday to demonstrate his support for Israel in the aftermath of the Hamas attack, the White House announced Monday, adding that he would also travel to Jordan for a summit meeting with the heads of States of Jordan, Egypt and the president of Palestinian Authority.“President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Will travel to Israel on Wednesday, October 18, to demonstrate his steadfast support for Israel in the face of Hamas's brutal terrorist attack and to consult on next steps,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement on Monday night.Biden will then travel to Amman, Jordan, where he will meet with His Majesty King Abdullah of Jordan, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.“He will reiterate that Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian people's right to dignity and self-determination and discuss the humanitarian needs of civilians in Gaza,” Jean-Pierre said.Earlier in the day, the US president spoke over the phone with his Egyptian counterpart El-Sisi and Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani of Iraq during which they talked about the situation in the region after the Hamas terrorist attack in Israel.In the call, Biden and El-Sisi discussed ongoing efforts to alleviate the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, in coordination with the United Nations (UN), Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, Israel, and other regional partners, and the need to preserve stability in the Middle East more broadly.“Biden condemned Hamas' terrorist attack on Israel and reiterated that Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian people's right to dignity and self-determination. The two leaders agreed to continue their close coordination to prevent the conflict from widening and ensure humanitarian assistance reaches those in need,” said a readout of the call.In Biden's call with Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani of Iraq, they discussed ongoing efforts to prevent an expansion of the conflict in Gaza in the wake of Hamas' abhorrent attack in Israel.“The two leaders discussed the importance of addressing the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, in coordination with the UN and regional partners,” said a readout of the call.Biden and Al-Sudani also affirmed the importance of the bilateral partnership between Iraq and the United States as outlined in the Strategic Framework Agreement between our two countries. They finally committed to regular coordination between their teams to advance shared objectives and preserve regional stability over the coming weeks, the readout said.Meanwhile, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant to continue discussions on Israel's operations to restore security following the Hamas attack. The Secretary reiterated the US' commitment to continue expediting security assistance and preventing conflict escalation, a media release said.Austin emphasised civilian safety and thanked the Gallant for efforts to restore safe drinking water access in Gaza, it said.In the morning, Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were briefed by their national security team on the latest updates in the wake of Hamas' abhorrent attack in Israel and the resulting conflict in Gaza.Chief of Staff Jeff Zients joined the briefing led by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Bill Burns, the White House said.\n",

      "Israeli forces backed by fighter jets and drones carried out a second ground raid into Gaza in as many days and struck targets on the outskirts of Gaza City, the military said Friday, as it prepares for a widely expected ground invasion of the Hamas-ruled territory.US warplanes meanwhile struck targets in eastern Syria that the Pentagon said were linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guard after a string of attacks on US forces by Iran-backed fighters, adding to the already high regional tensions fueled by the three-week-old Gaza war.The Palestinian death toll has soared past 7,000 as Israel has carried out waves of devastating airstrikes in response to a bloody Hamas incursion into southern Israel on Oct 7. The Health Ministry in Gaza, which tracks the toll, released a detailed list of names and ID numbers on Thursday. The toll includes more than 2,900 minors and more than 1,500 women.The overall number of deaths far exceeds the combined toll of all four previous wars between Israel and Hamas, estimated at around 4,000.More than 1,400 people in Israel, mostly civilians, were slain during the initial Hamas attack, according to the Israeli government. Hamas is holding at least 229 captives inside Gaza, including men, women, children and older adults.The airstrikes have flattened entire neighborhoods, causing a level of death and destruction unseen in the last four wars between Israel and Hamas. Over a million people have fled their homes, with many heeding Israeli orders to evacuate to the south, despite continuing Israeli strikes across the sealed-off territory.The humanitarian crisis sparked by the war and the Israeli siege has sparked protests across the region, and more demonstrations were expected later Friday after weekly Muslim prayers.The military said ground forces raided inside Gaza, striking dozens of militant targets over the past 24 hours. It said aircraft and artillery bombed targets in Shijaiyah, a neighborhood on the outskirts of Gaza City that was the scene of a bloody urban battle in the 2014 Gaza war.The military said the soldiers exited the territory without suffering any casualties. It reported an earlier raid into northern Gaza early Thursday, saying ground forces battled militants and struck anti-tank missile firing positions in an operation that lasted hours.Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli military spokesman, said the raids enable forces to “uncover the enemy,” to kill militants and to remove explosives and launch pads. The aim is “to prepare the ground for the next stages of the war,” he added.The damage to Gaza from nearly three weeks of bombardment showed in satellite photos of several locations taken before the war and again in recent days.Entire rows of residential buildings simply disappear in the photos, reduced to smears of dust and rubble. A complex of 13 high-rises by the sea was pounded to dust near Gaza City's al-Shati refugee camp, leaving only a few tottering bits of facade. Just down the street, hardly anything remained in what had been a neighborhood of low-built homes on winding lanes, according to the photos by Maxar Technologies.The military says it only strikes militant targets and accuses Hamas of operating among civilians in an attempt to protect its fighters. The Israeli military said an airstrike killed one of two masterminds of the Oct. 7 massacre, Shadi Barud, the head of Hamas' intelligence unit.Palestinian militants have fired thousands of rockets into Israel since the war began.Hamas' military wing said Thursday that Israeli bombardment has so far killed about 50 of the hostages. There was no immediate comment from Israeli officials, who have denied previous, similar claims.The conflict has threatened to ignite a wider war across the region.Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed ally of Hamas in Lebanon, has repeatedly traded fire with Israel along the border, and Israel has carried out airstrikes targeting Iran-linked groups in Syria. The United States has sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the region, along with additional fighter jets and other weaponry and personnel, in part to deter Iran and its allies from entering the war on the side of Hamas.U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the strikes in eastern Syria were “a response to a series of ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against U.S. Personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian-backed militia groups that began on Oct. 17.”He said President Joe Biden directed the narrowly tailored strikes “to make clear that the United States will not tolerate such attacks and will defend itself, its personnel and its interests.” He added that the operation was separate and distinct from Israel's war against Hamas.Syrian opposition activists in the area said the two locations are associated with Iranian arms shipments to militant groups in the region, and had been evacuated ahead of the strikes. There were no immediate reports of casualties.Egyptian state media reported that six people were lightly wounded when a rocket slammed into a medical building in the town of Taba, on the border with Israel. It was not immediately known who fired the projectile.Hagari, the Israeli military spokesperson, said “an aerial threat was identified in the area of the Red Sea,” which appeared to be the source of the blast in Egypt. He said fighter jets were dispatched to the area and that Israel, Egypt and the U.S. Were tightening their defenses in the region.Last week, a U.S. Navy destroyer in the northern Red Sea shot down three cruise missiles and several drones launched toward Israel by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in northern Yemen.In Gaza, supplies of food, medicine and fuel for powering emergency generators are running low. The U.N. Agency for Palestinian refugees, which provides basic services to hundreds of thousands of people, including operating schools turned into shelters, has said it may run out of fuel within days.Gaza's sole power station shut down for lack of fuel days after the start of the war, and Israel has barred all fuel deliveries, saying it believes Hamas would steal them for military purposes.About 1.4 million of Gaza's 2.3 million residents have fled their homes, with nearly half of them crowding into U.N. Shelters. Hundreds of thousands remain in northern Gaza, despite Israel ordering them to evacuate to the south and saying that those who remain might be considered “accomplices” of Hamas.In recent days, Israel has let more than 70 trucks with aid enter from Egypt through the Rafah crossing, the only entry point into Gaza not controlled by Israel. But aid workers say the convoys meet only a tiny fraction of the territory's mounting humanitarian needs. Before the war, an average of 500 trucks entered Gaza each day.The U.S. Has been working with other mediators to send in more humanitarian aid, but Israel is demanding strict screening to make sure none falls into the hands of Hamas. The U.S. Says Hamas has meanwhile refused to open the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing to let hundreds of foreign passport holders leave.\n",

      "US fighter jets launched airstrikes early Friday on two locations in eastern Syria linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, the Pentagon said, in retaliation for a slew of drone and missile attacks against U.S. Bases and personnel in the region that began early last week.The U.S. Strikes reflect the Biden administration's determination to maintain a delicate balance. The U.S. Wants to hit Iranian-backed groups suspected of targeting the U.S. As strongly as possible to deter future aggression, possibly fueled by Israel's war against Hamas, while also working to avoid inflaming the region and provoking a wider conflict.According to a senior U.S. Military official, the precision strikes were carried out near Boukamal by two F-16 fighter jets, and they struck weapons and ammunition storage areas that were connected to the IRGC. The official said there had been Iranian-aligned militia and IRGC personnel on the base and no civilians, but the U.S. Does not have any information yet on casualties or an assessment of damage. The official would not say how many munitions were launched by the F-16s.A senior defense official said the sites were chosen because the IRGC stores the types of munitions there that were used in the strikes against U.S. Bases and troops. The two officials briefed reporters after the strikes on condition of anonymity to provide details on the mission that had not yet been made public.According to the Pentagon, there have now been at least 19 attacks on U.S. Bases and personnel in Iraq and Syria since Oct. 17, including three new ones Thursday. Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said 21 U.S. Personnel were injured in two of those assaults that used drones to target al-Asad Airbase in Iraq and al-Tanf Garrison in Syria.In a statement, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the “precision self-defense strikes are a response to a series of ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against U.S. Personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian-backed militia groups that began on October 17.”He said President Joe Biden directed the narrowly tailored strikes “to make clear that the United States will not tolerate such attacks and will defend itself, its personnel, and its interests.” And he added that the operation was separate and distinct from Israel's war against Hamas.The senior defense official told reporters that the F-16 airstrikes will have a significant impact on the ability of Iranian proxy groups to continue to attack U.S. Forces. Asked what groups were targeted, the official said there are several that can have different names, but the U.S. Holds Tehran responsible for funding, arming, equipping and directing the proxies. The official said the airstrikes were not designed to expand the conflict in the region, but to compel Iran to direct the militia groups to cease the attacks on American bases and personnel.The Biden administration has not accused Iran of having a direct role in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel and has said it appears so far that Tehran was not aware of it beforehand. But the U.S. Has noted that Iran has long supported Hamas and has raised concerns that Iran and its proxies could turn the conflict into a wider war.Austin said the U.S. Does not seek a broader conflict, but if Iranian proxy groups continue, the U.S. Won't hesitate to take additional action to protect its forces.According to the Pentagon, all the U.S. Personnel hurt in the militant attacks received minor injuries and all returned to duty. In addition, a contractor suffered a cardiac arrest and died while seeking shelter from a possible drone attack.The retaliatory strikes came as no surprise. Officials at the Pentagon and the White House have made it clear for the past week that the U.S. Would respond, with Ryder saying again Thursday that it would be “at the time and place of our choosing.”“I think we've been crystal clear that we maintain the inherent right of defending our troops and we will take all necessary measures to protect our forces and our interests overseas,” he told reporters during a Pentagon briefing earlier in the day.Biden said Wednesday that he had warned Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, that if Tehran continues to “move against” U.S. Forces in the Middle East, “we will respond.”The latest spate of strikes by the Iranian-linked groups came in the wake of a deadly explosion at a Gaza hospital, triggering protests in a number of Muslim nations. The Israeli military has relentlessly attacked Gaza in retaliation for the devastating Hamas rampage in southern Israel nearly three weeks ago, but Israel has denied responsibility for the al-Ahli hospital blast and the U.S. Has said its intelligence assessment found that Tel Aviv was not to blame.The U.S., including the Pentagon, has repeatedly said any strike response by America would be directly tied to the attacks on the troops, and not connected to the war between Israel and Hamas. Such retaliation and strikes against Iranian targets in Syria after similar attacks on U.S. Bases are routine.In March, for example, the U.S. Struck sites in Syria used by groups affiliated with Iran's Revolutionary Guard after an Iranian-linked attack killed a U.S. Contractor and wounded seven other Americans in northeast Syria. American F-15 fighter jets flying out of al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar struck several locations around Deir el-Zour.U.S. Officials have routinely stressed that the American response is designed to be proportional, and is aimed at deterring strikes against U.S. Personnel who are focused on the fight against the Islamic State group.U.S. Officials have not publicly tied the recent string of attacks in Syria and Iraq to the violence in Gaza, but Iranian officials have openly criticized the U.S. For providing weapons to Israel that have been used to strike Gaza, resulting in civilian death.The Pentagon, meanwhile, has beefed up air defenses in the region to protect U.S. Forces. The U.S. Has said it is sending several batteries of Patriot missile systems, a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery and additional fighter jets.The THAAD is being sent from Fort Bliss, Texas, and the Patriot batteries are from Fort Liberty in North Carolina and Fort Sill in Oklahoma. An Avenger air defense system from Fort Liberty is also being sent.Officials have said as much as two battalions of Patriots are being deployed. A battalion can include at least three Patriot batteries, which each have six to eight launchers.Ryder said Thursday that about 900 troops have deployed or are in the process of going to the Middle East region, including those associated with the air defense systems.\n",

      "The Indian embassy at Tel Aviv and the Representative Office of India in Palestine on Saturday issued advisories asking Indian nationals in respective countries to “remain vigilant” and “directly contact the Office” in case of emergency as a full-fledged war broke out between the ruling Hamas militant group in the Gaza Strip and Israel killing at least 498 people from both sides.As they entered southern Israel by land, sea and air, using paragliders, Hamas militants fired more than 2,000 rockets from the Gaza Strip into Israel, according to the Israeli military. Hamas says it captured several Israeli soldiers near the border.The surprise attack has killed 200 people and injured more than 1,100 in Israel. In the Gaza Strip side, there were 198 dead and about 1,500 wounded in Israel's counterattack, media reports said.\n",

      "The surprise and unprecedented multifront attack – by air, land and sea – by the Hamas militant group in southern Israel from the Gaza Strip is a result of a \"colossal failure\" of the country's intelligence agencies, according to media reports and experts.Militants from Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, fired more than 3,000 rockets from the Gaza Strip into Israel on Saturday morning, according to the Israeli military, while Hamas fighters entered southern Israel by land, sea and air, using paragliders and even captured several Israeli soldiers near the border.At least 350 Israelis, including soldiers, have been killed and more than 1,900 injured in Israel - the deadliest day for the country in at least 50 years. On the Gaza Strip side, there are nearly 300 deaths and about 1,500 wounded in Israel’s counterattack, media reports said on Sunday.\n",

      "The European Union began taking steps on Thursday to limit the impact of the war between Israel and Hamas on the bloc, amid heightened security tensions after a firebomb attack on a Berlin synagogue and killings in Belgium and France by suspected Islamic extremists.Spain, which currently holds the EU's rotating presidency, activated a crisis mechanism to speed up decision-making and coordination between the 27 member countries, the bloc's institutions and major partners like the United Nations or the United States.Officials from across the EU have expressed concerns about a rise in anti-semitic attacks, radicalization online, the use of encrypted messaging services by extremists, and the need to speed up the deportation of people who might pose a public danger.But calls for an increase in security across the board are creating deep unease as the solutions being discussed could undermine free movement and the right to assemble in Europe.Italy is introducing border checks to counter a possible rise in tensions over the Israel-Hamas war. Denmark and Sweden are too, due to what they have said is a terrorist threat. France intends to keep checks in place until at least May 2024, citing “new terrorist threats and external borders situation.”More police have been deployed in Belgium, France and Germany.EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell believes part of the solution to Europe's security woes must involve the bloc helping diplomatically and financially to bring an end to years of conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.“We have learned from history that the most difficult decisions are always taken when we are on the edge of the abyss. I believe that is where we are now: on the edge of the abyss,” Borrell told EU lawmakers on Wednesday.“When I hear Muslim religious authorities speaking the language of inter-religious conflict and explicitly stating that Europe is a party to this conflict, I feel that the storm clouds are looming,” he said.Still, not all of Europe's challenges are directly linked to the war.Earlier on Thursday, Sweden hosted a meeting of ministers from eight countries, among them Germany, Belgium and France, focused on how to handle incidents where people burn the Muslim holy book, the Quran.Prosecutors are trying to establish whether that was a key motive for a Tunisian man to shoot three Swedes in Brussels on Monday, killing two of them, ahead of a Belgium-Sweden soccer match in the capital.While the Quran burnings are not directly linked to the conflict between Israel and Hamas, they are a sign of rising tensions between religious and other communities in Europe.The war that began October 7 has become the deadliest of five Gaza wars for both sides. More than 5,000 people have been killed in Israel and Gaza. Nearly 12,500 Palestinians have been wounded, and over 200 people in Israel taken hostage.“We have to address multiple impacts from the continuing crisis in the Middle East\" in the EU, European Commission Vice-President Margaritis Schinas said.“This entails the protection of our Jewish communities, but also the protection against a generalised climate of Islamophobia that has no place in our society,” he told reporters in Luxembourg, where EU interior ministers were meeting.Pro-Palestinian rallies have been held in several European cities since the war. France has banned them. Germany has also promised to take tougher action against Hamas, which is already on the EU's list of terrorist organizations.Chancellor Olaf Scholz told the German parliament that local authorities “must not allow gatherings … at which it must be feared that anti-semitic slogans will be shouted, that people's deaths will be glorified and everything we can't accept here.”In France, the Palace of Versailles — a major tourist attraction — and three airports were evacuated for security reasons and temporarily closed Wednesday. The incidents were the latest in a spate of evacuations in the past five days, and the French government is threatening to fine or jail prank callers.They followed the killing of a teacher in northern France on Friday by a suspected Islamic extremist.French Interior Minister Gerland Darmanin noted that two foreigners were behind the recent attacks in Belgium and France, and he insisted that long-delayed reforms of EU asylum rules must be put in place.Europe must “manage our borders, register people and conduct the security interviews that are necessary before every asylum request,” he told reporters.The EU has agreements with Turkey and Tunisia to persuade them to prevent migrants reaching Europe — and take them back if they do get through — but they are not working well. Other deals, with Egypt notably, are planned.\n",

      "Noted Indian Americans, including two Republican presidential candidates Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy, have rallied behind Israel following unprecedented attacks on it by the Hamas militant group that has left hundreds dead.Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a barrage of rocket attacks in southern Israel on Saturday, killing over 600 people, including soldiers, and wounding more than 1,900.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in response launched multiple airstrikes targeting Hamas' key infrastructure. About 1,000 people have been confirmed dead in Israel and Gaza in the biggest escalation in decades between the two sides.“Hamas and the backers who support them, the Iranian regime, were chanting 'Death to Israel, death to America.' That's what we have to remember. We are united with Israel because Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and the Iranian backers hate us,\" Republican presidential candidate Haley told NBC News on Sunday.\"We have to remember that what happened to Israel could happen here in America. And I hope that we all unite and stand with Israel because they really need us right now,” she said.In a post on X, Haley told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to “finish them (Hamas)”.Hamas is a Palestinian Islamist militant group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The Gaza Strip is home to about 2.3 million people. It is a 41km-long and 10km-wide territory surrounded by Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.Haley said she had introduced a resolution denouncing Hamas when she was the US ambassador to the UN.“America was the only member of the Security Council to vote for it. This is what Israel is up against a world that denies the evil in front of them. We did not bow to world pressure then—we won't now,” she said.Other Indian American Republican candidate Ramaswamy said the key lesson for America to learn from the attack on Israel was that it cannot be complacent about defending its own borders.\"If it can happen there, it can happen here. Our own border is near-completely porous right now. The Southern Border is a disaster and I visited the Northern Border yesterday which is wide open for invasion. Hamas picked a moment when Israel is deeply divided over domestic politics, as we are now here at home,” he said.“Our own foreign policy establishment has focused on distant foreign priorities while leaving us badly vulnerable on border defence, cyber and super-EMP defence, nuclear missile defence, and space-based defences. We can't lose sight of that and should use the attacks on Israel as a wake-up call here at home,” Ramaswamy said on Sunday.Mukesh Aghi, president and CEO of US India Strategic and Partnership Forum (USISPF) posted on social media platform X on Sunday: “I stand with Israel” with the flag of India in the backdrop.Bharat Barai, Indian Indian-American community leader, said Hamas and Hezbollah are the most barbaric terrorist organisations in the world.“Israel has every right to destroy this brutal terrorist outfit for attacking Israel, murdering, abducting, raping and torturing innocent Israeli citizens. The entire civilised world must condemn Hamas and other similar barbarians,” he said.The terrorist attacks by Hamas on the people of Israel are absolutely \"horrific\", said community leader Ajay Jain Bhutoria.“I stand with Israel in its unwavering right to defend itself. My prayers are with the dead, reported hostages, and hundreds injured and all affected by these horrific attacks. I strongly condemn the terrorist attacks against Israel,” he said.“These acts of violence are completely unacceptable. We stand with Israel and fully support its right to defend itself. Our thoughts are with everyone affected by this. Civilian innocent life must be protected on both sides including in Palestine,” Bhutoria said.Indian American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi said the United States “unequivocally” stands with the people of Israel against this \"gruesome\" terror attack and strongly supports its right to defend itself.Sunday's war crimes carried out by Hamas against Israeli women and children were inhuman and appalling, said Indian American Congressman Ro Khanna.“My heart breaks for the victims, and I stand in solidarity with the people of Israel at this dark moment,” he said.Strongly condemning the terrorist attack by Hamas, Indian American Congressman Dr Ami Bera said that it is more important than ever that the United States stands with Israel and its right to defend its sovereignty.“America stands firmly with Israel,” said Indian American Congressman Shri Thanedar, adding that Congress must rally behind Israel until this threat is addressed and security is restored.\n",

      "Nearly three dozen trucks entered Gaza in the largest aid convoy since the war between Israel and Hamas began, but humanitarian workers said the assistance still fell desperately short of needs after thousands of people broke into warehouses to take flour and basic hygiene products.The Gaza Health Ministry said on Sunday the death toll among Palestinians passed 8,000, mostly women and minors, as Israeli tanks and infantry pursued what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called a “second stage” in the war ignited by Hamas' brutal October 7 incursion. The toll is without precedent in decades of Israeli-Palestinian violence. Over 1,400 people have died on the Israeli side, mainly civilians killed during the initial attack, also an unprecedented figure.Communications were restored to most of Gaza's 2.3 million people Sunday after an Israeli bombardment described by residents as the most intense of the war knocked out phone and internet services late Friday.Israel has allowed only a trickle of aid to enter. On Sunday, 33 trucks carrying water, food and medicine entered the only border crossing from Egypt, a spokesperson at the Rafah crossing, Wael Abo Omar, told The Associated Press.After visiting the Rafah crossing, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court called the suffering of civilians “profound\" and said he had not been able to enter Gaza. “These are the most tragic of days,” said Karim Khan, whose court has been investigating the actions of Israeli and Palestinian authorities since 2014.Khan called on Israel to respect international law but stopped short of accusing it of war crimes. He called Hamas' October 7 attack a serious violation of international humanitarian law. “The burden rests with those who aim the gun, missile or rocket in question,” he said.The Israeli military said Sunday that it had struck more than 450 militant targets over the past 24 hours, including Hamas command centers and anti-tank missile launching positions. Huge plumes of smoke rose over Gaza City. Military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said dozens of militants were killed.Hagari, who said ground operations were intensifying, also reiterated calls for Gaza residents to move south, saying they'd have better access to food, water and medicine there.“This is a matter of urgency,” he said.Israel says most Gaza residents have heeded its orders to flee to the southern part of the besieged territory, but hundreds of thousands remain in the north, in part because Israel has also bombarded targets in so-called safe zones. More than 1.4 million people in Gaza have fled their homes.The Hamas military wing said its militants clashed with Israeli troops who entered the northwest Gaza Strip with small arms and anti-tank missiles. Palestinian militants have continued firing rockets into Israel, including toward its commercial hub, Tel Aviv.The aid warehouse break-ins were “a worrying sign that civil order is starting to break down after three weeks of war and a tight siege on Gaza,\" said Thomas White, Gaza director for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA. \"People are scared, frustrated and desperate.”UNRWA spokesperson Juliette Touma said the crowds broke into four facilities on Saturday. She said the warehouses did not contain any fuel, which has been in critically short supply since Israel cut off all shipments. Israel says Hamas would use it for military purposes and that the militant group is hoarding large fuel stocks for itself in the territory. That claim couldn't be independently verified.One warehouse held 80 tons of food, the U.N. World Food Program said. It emphasized that at least 40 of its trucks need to cross into Gaza daily just to meet growing food needs.President Joe Biden in a call with Netanyahu on Sunday “underscored the need to immediately and significantly increase the flow of humanitarian assistance to meet the needs of civilians in Gaza,” the US said.Israeli authorities said they would soon allow more humanitarian aid to enter Gaza.But the head of civil affairs at COGAT, the Israeli defense body responsible for Palestinian civilian affairs, provided no details on how much aid would be available. Elad Goren also said Israel has opened two water lines in southern Gaza within the past week. The AP could not independently verify that either line was functioning.Meanwhile, crowded hospitals in Gaza came under growing threat. Residents living near Shifa Hospital, the territory's largest, said Israeli airstrikes overnight hit near the complex where tens of thousands of civilians are sheltering. Israel accuses Hamas of having a secret command post beneath the hospital but has not provided much evidence. Hamas denies the allegations.The Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service said nearby Israeli airstrikes damaged parts of another Gaza City hospital after it received two calls from Israeli authorities on Sunday ordering it to evacuate. Some windows were blown out, and rooms were covered in debris. The rescue service said airstrikes have hit as close as 50 meters (yards) from the Al-Quds Hospital where 14,000 people are sheltering.Israel ordered the hospital to evacuate more than a week ago, but it and other medical facilities have refused, saying evacuation would mean death for patients on ventilators.“Under no circumstances, hospitals should be bombed,” the director general of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Robert Mardini, told CBS' “Face the Nation.\"About 20,000 people were sheltering at Nasser Hospital, emergency director Dr. Mohammed Qandeel said. “I brought my kids to sleep here,” said one displaced resident who gave her name only as Umm Ahmad. “I used to be afraid of my kids playing in the sand. Now their hands are dirty with the blood on the floor.”An Israeli airstrike hit a two-story house in Khan Younis on Sunday, killing at least 13 people, including 10 from one family. The bodies were brought to the nearby Nasser Hospital, according to an AP journalist at the scene.The military escalation has increased domestic pressure on Israel's government to secure the release of some 230 hostages seized by Hamas fighters during the October 7 attack.Hamas says it is ready to release all hostages if Israel releases all of the thousands of Palestinians held in its prisons. Desperate family members of the Israeli captives met with Netanyahu on Saturday and expressed support for an exchange. Israel has dismissed the Hamas offer.“If Hamas does not feel military pressure, nothing will move forward,” Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told families of the hostages Sunday.The Israeli military has stopped short of calling its gradually expanding ground operations inside Gaza an all-out invasion. Casualties on both sides are expected to rise sharply as Israeli forces and Palestinian militants battle in dense residential areas.Israel says it targets Hamas fighters and infrastructure and that the militants operate among civilians, putting them in danger.The violence has inflicted serious damage on Gaza's civilian infrastructure. The territory's sole power plant shut down shortly after the war began. Hospitals are struggling to keep emergency generators running to operate incubators and other life-saving equipment, and UNRWA is trying to keep water pumps and bakeries running. As water ran short, some Gazans bathed in the sea.The fighting has raised concerns that the violence could spread across the region. Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah have engaged in daily skirmishes along Israel's northern border. Hagari said Israel on Sunday struck three militant cells that fired from Lebanon into Israel and killed militants who were trying to enter. Hamas said its forces in Lebanon fired 16 missiles at the Israeli city of Nahariya. Hezbollah, a Hamas ally, said it also fired missiles at several sites.The Israeli military said Sunday night that rockets from Syria fell in open Israeli territory. It did not report any injuries.Roughly 250,000 Israelis have been evacuated from their homes because of violence along the border with Gaza and the northern border with Lebanon, according to the Israeli military.\n",

I have never seen such confusion from the Indian government over the Palestine and Gaza issue. The first statement of the PM totally supported Israel. When there was a reaction from the outside world and (within)India, the foreign ministry took a different line and spoke in favour of Palestine,\" Pawar, a former defence minister, claimed.India has abstained in the UN General Assembly on a resolution that called for an immediate humanitarian truce in the Israel-Hamas conflict leading to a cessation of hostilities. It also called for unhindered humanitarian access in the Gaza strip.The 193 members of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), which met in a resumed 10th Emergency Special Session, voted on the draft resolution submitted by Jordan and co-sponsored by more than 40 nations, including Bangladesh, Maldives, Pakistan, Russia and South Africa.The 193-member world body adopted the resolution by a vote of 120-14 with 45 abstentions.Earlier this month, after Hamas launched its incursions, PM Narendra Modi had expressed solidarity with Israel and condemned the \"terrorist attacks\".\"Deeply shocked by the news of terrorist attacks in Israel. Our thoughts and prayers are with the innocent victims and their families. We stand in solidarity with Israel at this difficult hour,\" Modi had said.On October 10, Modi told his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu that people of India stand firmly with his country, expressing strong and unequivocal condemnation of terrorism in all its forms.On Thursday, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) described the strikes by Hamas on Israeli cities as \"terror attacks\", but also reaffirmed India's long-standing position, advocating negotiations towards establishing a \"sovereign, independent and viable\" state of Palestine living side-by-side at peace with Israel.MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said at a media briefing there was a universal obligation to observe international humanitarian law as also a global responsibility to fight the menace of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\n",

      "Lyon coach Fabio Grosso suffered a head injury as the team bus came under attack from fans throwing projectiles, forcing the postponement of the French league soccer game at Marseille.The team bus was hit on the way to Stade Velodrome, shattering some windows on Sunday.Grosso was injured by falling shards of glass and needed medical treatment with his face bleeding heavily. Lyon assistant coach Raffaele Longo was also injured.Grosso suffered a deep cut above his left eye that required stitches and a large bandage wrapped around his head.“Our team (had) decided they would play,” Lyon president John Textor told Amazon Prime Video.“I'm obviously proud of the captain, proud of the players, for wanting to do that.”Lyon changed its mind when more details about Grosso's condition emerged.“It was emotional. We have a coach who's got blood coming out of his head, he's got pieces of glass stuck in his head,” Textor said.“I couldn't have a conversation with him. It looked like he had a concussion. At that point, our team was mixed. They said, you know, it's not an emotional, physical game. It's a tactical game, and this is not the way football should be played. As the night went on, I think our team supported the decision of the referee.”A few minutes before the scheduled kickoff time at 1945 GMT, a message on the giant screen at Stade Velodrome said: “Dear supporters, the game will not be played tonight.”A French league commission will meet to decide what to do with the fixture.“Lyon didn't want the game to be played,” referee Francois Letexier told a news conference. “We also applied the protocol, which states that the game shouldn't be played when a party is injured and his participation is compromised because of this physical assault.”Ten years ago, fans from Marseille and Lyon fought in a violent brawl after meeting each other by chance at a service station forecourt after traveling to and from their respective games. The bloody clash left 17 injured, and the atmosphere has been tense ever since when they play each other.Marseille president Pablo Longoria said Sunday's attack was unacceptable.“What happened to Lyon coach Fabio Grosso must be prevented. It's completely unacceptable,” Longoria told Amazon Prime Video.“I'm angry. I'm really upset by the current situation. It shouldn't happen in football or in society.”Coaches carrying Lyon fans were also attacked. The police arrested seven people suspected of being involved in Sunday's incidents but did not give details.Grosso scored the winning penalty kick for Italy in the shootout victory over France in the 2006 World Cup final.Both clubs have been under pressure lately.Despite replacing Marcelino with Gennaro Gattuso as coach in September, Marseille is still showing poor form with one win and three losses in its last four league games.Gattuso went to check on his former Italy teammate in the locker room.Lyon is the only team still winless in the league. Replacing Laurent Blanc with Grosso as coach in September hasn't paid off for Lyon, which sits in last place.\n",

      "Israel pounded the Gaza Strip with airstrikes Thursday, including in the south where Palestinians were told to take refuge, as the Israeli defense minister ordered ground troops to prepare to see Gaza “from the inside”, though he didn't indicate when the ground assault would begin.Gaza's overwhelmed hospitals tried to stretch out ebbing medical supplies and fuel for generators, as authorities worked out logistics for a desperately needed aid delivery from Egypt. Doctors in darkened wards across Gaza performed surgeries by the light of mobile phones and used vinegar to treat infected wounds.Amid the violence, President Joe Biden pledged unwavering support for Israel's security, “today and always,” while adding that the world “can't ignore the humanity of innocent Palestinians\" in the besieged Gaza Strip.In an address Thursday night from the Oval office, hours after returning to Washington from an urgent visit to Israel, Biden drew a distinction between ordinary Palestinians and Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza. He linked the current war in Gaza to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, saying Hamas and Russian President Vladimir Putin \"both want to completely annihilate a neighbouring democracy.”Biden said he was sending an “urgent budget request” to Congress on Friday, to cover emergency military aid to both Israel and Ukraine.Meanwhile, an unclassified US intelligence assessment delivered to Congress estimated casualties in an explosion at a Gaza City hospital this week on the “low end” of 100 to 300 deaths. The death toll “still reflects a staggering loss of life,” US intelligence officials said in the report, seen by The Associated Press. It said intelligence officials were still assessing the evidence and their casualty estimate may evolve.Biden and other US officials already have said that US intelligence officials believe the explosion at al-Ahli Hospital was not caused by an Israeli airstrike. Thursday's findings echoed that.The Israeli military has relentlessly attacked Gaza in retaliation for the devastating Oct. 7 Hamas rampage in southern Israel. Even after Israel told Palestinians to evacuate the north of Gaza and flee south, strikes extended across the territory, heightening fears among the territory's 2.3 million people that nowhere was safe.Palestinian militants fired rockets into Israel from Gaza and Lebanon, and tensions flared in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.In a fiery speech to Israeli infantry soldiers on the Gaza border, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant urged the forces to “get organized, be ready” to move in. Israel has massed tens of thousands of troops along the border.“Whoever sees Gaza from afar now, will see it from the inside,\" he said. “It might take a week, a month, two months until we destroy them,” he added, referring to Hamas.Israel's consent for Egypt to let in food, water and medicine provided the first possible opening in its seal of the territory. Many Gaza residents are down to one meal a day and drinking dirty water.Egypt and Israel were still negotiating the entry of fuel for hospitals. Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said Hamas has stolen fuel from UN facilities and Israel wants assurances that won't happen. The first trucks of aid were expected to go in Friday.With the Egypt-Gaza border crossing in Rafah closed, the already dire conditions at Gaza's second-largest hospital deteriorated further, said Dr Mohammed Qandeel of Nasser Hospital in the southern town of Khan Younis. Power was shut off in most of the hospital and medical staff were using mobile phones for light.At least 80 wounded civilians and 12 dead flooded into the hospital after witnesses said a strike hit a residential building in Khan Younis. Doctors had no choice but to leave two to die because there were no ventilators, Qandeel said.“We can't save more lives if this keeps happening,” he said.The Gaza Health Ministry pleaded with gas stations to give fuel to hospitals and a U.N. Agency donated some of its last fuel.The agency's donation to Gaza City's Shifa Hospital, the territory's largest, would “keep us going for another few hours,” hospital director Mohammed Abu Selmia said.Al-Ahli Hospital was still recovering from Tuesday's explosion, which remains a point of dispute between Hamas and Israel. Hamas quickly said an Israeli airstrike hit the hospital, which Israel denied. The AP has not independently verified any of the claims or evidence released by the parties.The blast left body parts strewn on the hospital grounds, where crowds of Palestinians had clustered in hopes of escaping Israeli airstrikes. The US assessment noted “only light structural damage,” with no impact crater visible.Near al-Ahli, meanwhile, another explosion struck a Greek Orthodox church housing displaced Palestinians late Thursday, resulting in deaths and dozens of wounded. Abu Selmia, the Shifa Hospital director general, said dozens were hurt at the Church of Saint Porphyrios but could not give a precise death toll because bodies were buried under rubble.Palestinian authorities blamed the blast on an Israeli airstrike, a claim that could not be independently verified. The Greek Orthodox Patriarchy of Jerusalem condemned the attack and said it would “not abandon its religious and humanitarian duty” to provide assistance.The Gaza Health Ministry said 3,785 people have been killed in Gaza since the war began, the majority women, children and older adults. Nearly 12,500 were injured, and another 1,300 people were believed buried under rubble, authorities said.More than 1,400 people in Israel have been killed, mostly civilians slain during Hamas' deadly incursion. Roughly 200 others were abducted. The Israeli military said Thursday it had notified the families of 203 captives.More than 1 million Palestinians, about half of Gaza's population, have fled their homes in the north since Israel told them to evacuate, crowding into U.N.-run schools-turned-shelters or the homes of relatives.For the first time since Israel captured Gaza from Egypt in 1967, a major tent camp arose to house displaced people. Dozens of U.N.-provided tents lined a dirt lot in Khan Younis.The deal to get aid into Gaza through Rafah, the territory's only connection to Egypt, remained fragile. Israel said the supplies could only go to civilians and that it would “thwart” any diversions by Hamas. Biden said the deliveries “will end” if Hamas takes any aid.More than 200 trucks and some 3,000 tons of aid were positioned at or near Rafah, according to Khalid Zayed, the head of the Red Crescent for North Sinai.Under an arrangement reached between the United Nations, Israel and Egypt, U.N. Observers will inspect the trucks before entering Gaza. The U.N., working with the Egyptian and Palestinian Red Crescent, will ensure aid goes only to civilians, an Egyptian official and European diplomat told the AP. A UN flag will be raised on both sides of the crossing as a sign of protection against airstrikes, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media.It was not immediately clear how much cargo the crossing could handle. Waleed Abu Omar, spokesperson for the Palestinian side, said work has not started to repair the road damaged by Israeli airstrikes.Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry told Al-Arabiya TV that foreigners and dual nationals would be allowed to leave Gaza once the crossing was opened.Israel said it agreed to allow aid from Egypt because of a request by Biden — which followed days of intense talks with the US secretary of state to overcome staunch Israeli refusal.Israel had previously said it would let nothing into Gaza until Hamas freed the hostages taken from Israel. Relatives of some of the captives were furious over the aid announcement.“The Israeli government pampers the murderers and kidnappers,” the Hostage and Missing Families Forum said.The Israeli military said Thursday it killed a top Palestinian militant in Rafah and hit hundreds of targets across Gaza, including militant tunnel shafts, intelligence infrastructure and command centres. Palestinians have launched barrages of rockets at Israel since the fighting began.Violence was also escalating in the West Bank, where Israel carried out a rare airstrike Thursday, targeting militants in the Nur Shams refugee camp.Six Palestinians were killed, the Palestinian Health Ministry said, and the Israeli military said the strike killed militants and resulted in 10 Israeli officers being wounded. More than 74 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the war started.\n",

      "The United States on Friday expanded its effort to cut off funding for Hamas, announcing a second round of sanctions against people and organisations linked to the group since it launched an attack on Israel that killed more than 1,400 people.The new sanctions highlight Iran's role in providing financial, logistical and operational support to Hamas, the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control said in a statement.They include a Hamas representative in Iran and members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard.The sanctions were announced as Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo travelled to London to shore up support from Britain, one of America's closest allies, for the drive to squeeze off funding for Hamas, which both countries consider a terrorist organisation.“Today's action underscores the United States' commitment to dismantling Hamas's funding networks by deploying our counterterrorism sanctions authorities and working with our global partners to deny Hamas the ability to exploit the international financial system,” Adeyemo said.Among those targeted are Khaled Qaddoumi, described as a liaison between Hamas and the Iranian government; and Ali Morshed Shirazi and Mostafa Mohammad Khani, officials in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Qods Force who are accused of training and assisting Hamas fighters.The US also sanctioned a number of organisations, including the Iranian Bonyad Shahid, also known as the Martyrs Foundation. US officials say the group, which is affiliated with Palestinian Islamic Jihad, funnels millions of dollars through the Gaza-based Al-Ansar Charity Association for the families of militants.The practice “ultimately serves as a recruiting tool for terrorist activities”, the US said.The sanctions freeze any US-based assets owned or controlled by the named individuals and organisations. They also block financial transactions with those designated and prohibit the contribution of funds, goods and services to them.\n",

      "President Joe Biden said Friday he thought Hamas was motivated to attack Israel in part by a desire to stop that country from normalising relations with Saudi Arabia.“One of the reasons Hamas moved on Israel … they knew that I was about to sit down with the Saudis,” Biden said at a fundraising event. The US president indicated that he thinks Hamas militants launched a deadly assault on October 7 because, “Guess what? The Saudis wanted to recognise Israel” and were near being able to formally do so.Jerusalem and Riyadh had been steadily inching closer to normalization, with Biden working to help bring the two countries together, announcing plans in September at the Group of 20 summit in India to partner on a shipping corridor.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Biden on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in September and told him, “I think that under your leadership, Mr President, we can forge a historic peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia.”The Saudis had been insisting on protection and expanded rights for Palestinian interests as part of any broader agreement with Israel. An agreement would have been a feat of diplomacy that could have enabled broader recognition of Israel by other Arab and Muslim-majority nations that have largely opposed Israel since its creation 75 years ago in territory where Palestinians have long resided.But talks were interrupted after Hamas militants stormed from the blockaded Gaza Strip where Palestinians live into nearby Israeli towns.The October 7 attack coincided with a major Jewish holiday. It led to retaliatory airstrikes by Israel that have left the world on edge with the US trying to keep the war from widening, as 1,400 Israelis and 4,137 Palestinians have been killed. Hamas also captured more than 200 people as hostages after the initial assault.\n",

      "Israel on Tuesday bombed areas of southern Gaza where it had told Palestinians to flee to ahead of an expected invasion, killing dozens of people.Meanwhile, mediators struggled to break a deadlock over delivering aid to millions of increasingly desperate civilians in the territory, which has been besieged and under assault by Israel since a brutal attack by Hamas militants.Flaring violence along Israel's border with Lebanon also led to concerns over a widening regional conflict that diplomats were working to prevent.In Gaza, people wounded in the airstrikes were rushed to the hospital after heavy attacks outside the southern Gaza cities of Rafah and Khan Younis, residents reported. Basem Naim, a senior Hamas official and former health minister, reported 27 people were killed in Rafah and 30 in Khan Younis.An Associated Press reporter saw around 50 bodies brought to Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. Family members came to claim the bodies, wrapped in white bedsheets, some soaked in blood.An airstrike in Deir al Balah reduced a house to rubble, killing nine members of the family living there. Three members of another family that had evacuated from Gaza City were killed in a neighbouring home. The dead included one man and 11 women and children. Witnesses said there was no warning before the strike.The Israeli military said it was targeting Hamas hideouts, infrastructure and command centers.“When we see a target, when we see something moving that is Hamas, we'll take care of it. We'll handle it,\" said Lt Col Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesman.Israel has sealed off and bombed Hamas-ruled Gaza since the militant attack on southern Israel Oct. 7 killed over 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and left about 200 captive in Gaza.Israeli strikes have killed at least 2,778 people and wounded 9,700 others in Gaza, according to the Health Ministry. Nearly two-thirds of the dead were children, said Medhat Abbas, a Gaza Health Ministry official. The strikes have not stopped Hamas militants from continuing to barrage Israel with rockets launched from Gaza.Another 1,200 people across Gaza are believed buried under the rubble, alive or dead, health authorities said. Emergency teams struggled to rescue people while cut off from the internet and mobile networks, running out of fuel and exposed to unceasing airstrikes.On Monday Israeli warplanes struck the headquarters of the Civil Defence in Gaza City, killing seven paramedics. Another 10 medics and doctors have been killed on the job, health authorities said.Israel has massed troops at the border for an expected ground offensive, but Hecht said Tuesday no concrete decisions have been made.\"These plans are being developed. They will be decided by, and presented to, our political leadership,\" he said.Airstrikes, dwindling supplies, and Israel's mass evacuation order for the north of the Gaza Strip has thrown the tiny territory's 2.3 million people into upheaval and desperation.More than 1 million Palestinians have fled their homes, and 60% are now in the approximately 14-kilometre (8-mile) long area south of the evacuation zone, the UN said.Aid workers warned that the territory was near complete collapse as hospitals were on the verge of losing electricity, threatening the lives of thousands of patients, and hundreds of thousands of people searched for bread and water.Some departments in Gaza's only specialised cancer hospital stopped working because of fuel shortages and the remaining wards will run out within two days, according to a statement from Sobhi Skik, director general of the Turkish Friendship Hospital.At the Rafah crossing, Gaza's only connection to Egypt, truckloads of aid were waiting to go into the tiny, densely populated territory, and trapped civilians with foreign citizenship — many of them Palestinians with dual nationalities — were hoping desperately to get out.Mediators were trying to reach a cease-fire to open the border, which shut down last week after Israeli airstrikes. An agreement appeared to have been reached Monday, but Israel denied reports of a cease-fire in Rafah, which would be needed to open the gates. On Tuesday morning, they were still closed.An Egyptian official said Tuesday that Egypt and Israel agreed that the aid convoys at the border would travel into Israel for inspection at the Kerem Shalom crossing between Gaza and Israel.The aid would then be allowed into Gaza. A brief humanitarian cease-fire would take place and foreign nationals would be allowed to exit Gaza via Rafah, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to speak with the media.Both Hamas and Israel cast doubt on an immediate opening.\"The crossings are closed, and I'm not aware of a truce or stop of hostilities,\" Hecht said.Wael Abu Omar, Hamas' spokesman for the Rafah crossing, said: \"Up until now, there is no agreement.\"The World Food Programme said it had more than 300 tons of food waiting to cross into Gaza. \"No one is giving up on the hope that this (crossing) would be open,\" said WFP official Abeer Etefa.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who visited Israel for the second time in a week on Monday after a six-country tour through Arab nations, said in Tel Aviv that the US and Israel had agreed to develop a plan to enable humanitarian aid to reach civilians in Gaza. There were few details, but the plan would include “the possibility of creating areas to help keep civilians out of harm's way”.Gen Erik Kurilla, the head of US Central Command, arrived in Tel Aviv for meetings with Israeli military authorities ahead of a Biden visit planned for Wednesday to signal White House support for Israel. Biden will also travel to Jordan to meet with Arab leaders amid fears the fighting could expand into a broader regional conflict.Israel evacuated towns near its northern border with Lebanon, where the military has exchanged fire repeatedly with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group.The military said it killed four militants wearing explosive vests who were attempting to cross into the country from Lebanon on Tuesday morning. Video from a reconnaissance drone the army shared showed the militants near the border wall before they were targeted, causing an explosion. No group immediately claimed responsibility.“Whoever approaches the border with Lebanon will be killed,” said Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari.Israel has warned Lebanon it will strongly retaliate against attacks from across the border.Israel fought a vicious month-long war with Hezbollah in 2006 that ended in a stalemate and a tense detente between the two sides.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned that Israel's continuing offensive in Gaza could cause a violent reaction across the region.“Bombardments should be immediately stopped. Muslim nations are angry,” Khamenei said, according to state media.Speaking to the Israeli Knesset on Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Iran and Hezbollah, “Don't test us in the north. Don't make the mistake of the past. Today, the price you will pay will be far heavier.\"Soon after he spoke, the Knesset floor was evacuated as rockets headed toward Jerusalem. Sirens in Tel Aviv prompted US and Israeli officials to take shelter in a bunker, officials said.The Israeli military said Monday at least 199 hostages were taken into Gaza, more than previously estimated. Hamas said it was holding 200 to 250 hostages.Hamas' military wing released a hostage video showing a dazed woman having her arm wrapped with bandages. The woman, who identified herself as Mia Schem, 21, rocked slightly as she spoke, the sound of explosions reverberating in the background.The plight of the hostages has dominated the Israeli media since the attack, with interviews with their relatives playing on television almost constantly. Israeli officials have vowed to maintain the siege of Gaza until the hostages are released.In Gaza, more than 400,000 displaced people in the south crowded into schools and other facilities of the UN agency for Palestinians. The agency said it has only 1 litre of water a day for each of its staff members trapped in the territory.Israel opened a water line into the south for three hours that benefitted only 14 per cent of Gaza's population, the UN said.\n",

      "Amid the intensifying Israel-Hamas conflict, this analysis delves into the intricate web of historical, political, and humanitarian factors shaping the crisis. From the longstanding US support for Israel to the divide within American politics, it scrutinises the complex dynamics. As casualties rise and diplomatic efforts falter, the urgency for a resolution that balances security with justice becomes paramount on the global stageThe US’ support for Israel is unequivocal. It has been consistent since the creation of the Jewish State on May 14, 1948. Washington is sticking to its long-established script that provides all the grounds for standing for Israel. From day one of the current attack of the Hamas over Israel, President Joe Biden is repeatedly echoing the line in public that Israel has a “legitimate right to defend itself”.This unquestionable support for Israel began with former President Harry Truman who became the first world leader to recognise the State of Israel. His decision was driven by two main considerations-first being a personal one i.e. his former business partner Edward Jacobson actually did all the foundational work to make the way for recognising the Jewish State by the UN in 1948. The second being a strategic perspective as Washington wanted to have a trusted ally in West Asia to spread its influence and to gradually counter the growing might of the USSR. Specifically, the US was using all its military, economic and diplomatic maneuvers to have major influence over the Suez Canal, the gateway to control strategic waterways and massive oil reserves in West Asian nations.In the last more than five decades, America’s unequivocal support to Israel grew with its decisive victory over major Arab nations like Syria, Jordan, Egypt, etc, in 1967 and in 1973. This literally changed the equation in favour of Israel in the US Congress. During the reign of President Barack Obama, the US Government signed an agreement with Israel to send $38 billion military aid over a period of 10 years, including Iron Dome Missile System to the Zionist nation. Besides these tilts towards Israel, another powerful politically sensitive organisation called American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) wields major influence over both the political parties and their top leaders.But all is not well for Israel in the US. For a long time, progressive Democrats in the US have opposed the Jewish treatment of the Palestinians. Back in July of this year, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a resolution pledging full support for the State of Israel. This resolution explicitly condemned anti-Semitism and declared that the country is neither racist nor an apartheid nation. It is worth noting that all of this occurred just before the President of Israel was scheduled to address a joint session of Congress. This historic resolution once again delivered an implicit rebuke to the progressive Democrats who had been criticizing Israel for its decades-long policies against Palestine.On the record, Pramila Jayapal, the Democrat from Washington and the head of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, referred to Israel as a “Racist State”, but later she retracted her comments. Pramila also clarified that she is not contesting the idea of Israel, but rather its present government’s policies. The irony lies in the fact that, despite her frontal attack on the Israeli government and opposition to its policies, most Democrats supported the resolution put forth by the Republican Party.And in the event of the current dastardly attack unleashed by Hamas over the Israeli state, the tensions between the moderate and progressive Democrats are sharply divided on Israel’s treatment of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and in the occupied West Bank region. The most powerful Republicans, and almost all the ordinary ones, are fully standing in solidarity with Israel at this hour of crisis. President Biden is trying to use this chaos as a re-election strategy for the next year’s election campaign, aiming to impress both the hardliners and many Americans who are completely in favour of crushing Hamas and its dastardly acts against innocent civilians.Some experts argue that the benefits of the US support for Israel no longer outweigh the costs. It has been a huge burden on the American exchequer. Once, the relationship between the US and Israel was justified both on moral and strategic grounds. The Jewish state readily offered an opportunity to America to influence the West Asian region after the Second World War.Indeed, the establishment of Israel was projected as a befitting response to widespread anti-Semitism in the West, particularly referring to the Holocaust under the tutelage of Adolf Hitler during the peak of the War. But at the same time, the majority in the West led by the US simply ignored the reality that the Arabs who had lived in Palestine for centuries had finally lost their indigenous land.What has been failed to project by Washington is Israel’s military prowess and advantage from all fronts over Palestine and its people. It is a war between David and Goliath. And on top of that Israel is fully backed by the military machine of the US, the world’s most powerful nation. So one can easily imagine what will be the fate of the fighting Palestinians and the Hamas fighters.For the first time, a US President visited Israel during the war. Not only Biden, but also his Secretary of State and Defense, Antony Blinken and Lloyd Austin respectively, landed in Israel between October 11-13, when hostilities were at their peak. Once they set the stage, President Biden came to Tel Aviv to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, demonstrating total solidarity with Israel.Interestingly, after Biden’s visit on October 18, Israel was ready to allow humanitarian aid coming to the Gaza Strip.The saddest part of the current quagmire is that innocent civilians are punished in the name of fighting the Hamas militants. When the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) ordered more than a million people to evacuate from North Gaza to shift to South Gaza, all international humanitarian agencies warned of dire consequences.  The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) immediately raised an alarm of a humanitarian tragedy if million people have to vacate their homes within 24 hours as the deadline set by Israel. The intention was to launch ground offensive against the Hamas and to rescue more than 200 hostages it has taken from Israel on the day of the attack i.e. Shabbat, the holy day of rest and recuperation. But then, Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian Authority, clearly said that civilians should not vacate North Gaza. The reason behind this is that this will offer another opportunity to the Zionist state to recapture more Palestinian territories to push forward its ulterior motives.And for Palestinians it could be the Second Nakba (catastrophe or cataclysm) as many of their older generations already experienced the First Nakba in 1948 during the creation of the Israeli state. The Nakba refers to displacement of thousands of Palestinians from their original homes to make way for the Jewish state. While ordering to evacuate, the Israeli State had stopped all the basic facilities like water, food, electricity, etc, to the Gaza enclave.When the tragic hospital blast took the lives of more than 500 civilians and the daily death count continues to rise, how can the US and the West remain silent spectators to this horror? It is true that Hamas took the lives of more than 1,300 innocent people on October 7 while the Jewish community was celebrating their festival. This is simply unpardonable.It is a criminal act on the part of Hamas which they had been planning for months to breach one of the world’s most sophisticated security and intelligence systems. According to records published on the UN website, the number of people killed in Gaza has now exceeded 5000, as reported by the de facto authorities there. Humanitarians are repeatedly calling for a ceasefire and for more aid convoys. Meanwhile, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, issued a new appeal for “sustained safe passage” for medical essentials and fuels to keep health facilities open. Sadly, women and children make up more than 62 per cent of the fatalities, while more than 15,000 people have been injured since October 7.Now the pertinent question here is that is it justified for the US, the world’s oldest democracy and leader of the global liberal order to continue sending arms, ammunitions, man and materials to bolster the Israeli defence forces to pound more and lethal attacks on the Gaza Strip? Are its civilians responsible for what Hamas did on South Israel? After long and sustained appeals from UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and other human rights and humanitarian aid agencies, why has the Biden Administration either failed or purposefully escalated another war in West Asia?It is not all justified on the part of the US to back Israel at this hour with its superior military equipment as it could exacerbate the war in an already chaotic West Asia. Nowhere the civilians of Gaza and west Bank are responsible for ghastly act of the Hamas and the current torture on them is absolutely uncalled for. Despite appeals from the UN and other international bodies, the US is spearheading the acts of aggression and providing all that Israel needs to win over the Hamas is nothing but its decade long agenda to stand behind the Jewish State. It does not vary depending on who comes to Washington. Finally Israel wins its favour from its big brother in the US. So the violence and long discrimination against the Palestinian people goes on.The Israel-Hamas war since October 7 is a grim reminder to the international community that violence only breeds more violence. It is time to halt war in favor of peace. We all need to bear in mind that this planet demands peace simply to serve the uncared for and the most vulnerable people all around.Maybe, the Palestinian people will not be able to reclaim their homeland but they all have the fundamental right to have peace and claim over whatever territories they have as of today. It is clear that a two-state solution may take longer than ever before looking at the current hostilities in place. Also, we all need to accept the fact that the way Hamas has displayed its might and brutality over innocent Israeli civilians will certainly not pave the way for an independent Palestine sooner or later.(The writer is currently president of the Global Research Foundation)\n",

      "More than a million people have fled their homes in the besieged Gaza Strip in the past week, ahead of expected Israel invasion that seeks to eliminate Hamas' leadership after its deadly attack.The enclave's food and water supplies are dwindling, and its hospitals are warning that they are on the verge of collapse.Israeli forces, supported by a growing deployment of US warships in the region and the call-up of some 360,000 reservists, positioned themselves along Gaza's border and drilled for what Israel said would be a broad campaign to dismantle the militant group.Israel said it has already struck dozens of military targets, including command centres and rocket launchers, and also killed Hamas commanders.Israeli officials have given no timetable for a ground incursion that aid groups warn could hasten a humanitarian crisis in the coastal Gaza enclave.A week of blistering airstrikes have demolished entire neighbourhoods but failed to stem militant rocket fire into Israel.The Gaza Health Ministry said 2,670 Palestinians have been killed and 9,600 wounded since the fighting erupted, more than in the 2014 Gaza war, which lasted over six weeks. That makes this the deadliest of the five Gaza wars for both sides.More than 1,400 Israelis have died, the vast majority civilians killed in Hamas' October 7 assault.At least 155 others, including children, were captured by Hamas and taken into Gaza, according to Israel. It's also the deadliest war for Israel since the 1973 conflict with Egypt and Syria.About 500,000 people, nearly one quarter of Gaza's population, were taking refuge in United Nations schools and other facilities across the territory, where water supplies were dwindling, said Juliette Touma, spokesperson for the UN's Palestinian refugee agency.“Gaza is running dry,” she said. The agency says an estimated 1 million people have been displaced in Gaza in a single week.The US State Department said Secretary of State Antony Blinken would return to Israel on Monday after completing a frantic six-country tour through Arab nations aimed at preventing the fighting from igniting a broader regional conflict.President Joe Biden is also considering a trip to Israel, though no plans have been finalised. In a television interview on Sunday night, Biden, who has repeatedly proclaimed support for Israel, nonetheless said he thought it would be a “big mistake” for the country to reoccupy Gaza.The same day, Israel's ambassadors to the US and UN said the country does not want an occupation. But Israel will do “whatever is needed to obliterate their (Hamas') capabilities”, ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan told CNN.Fighting along Israel's border with Lebanon, which has flared since the start of the latest Gaza war, intensified Sunday with Hezbollah militants firing rockets and an anti-tank missile, and Israel responding with airstrikes and shelling.The Israeli military also reported shooting at one of its border posts. The fighting killed at least one person on the Israeli side and wounded several on both sides of the border.An Israeli drone fired two missiles late Sunday at a hill west of the town of Kfar Kila in south Lebanon, the state-run National News Agency reported. There were no casualties reported in the strikes, which hit near a Lebanese army centre.Hezbollah said in a statement that it had fired rockets toward an Israeli military position in the northern border town of Shtula in retaliation for Israeli shelling that killed Reuters videographer Issam Abdallah on Friday and two Lebanese civilians on Saturday.A Hezbollah spokeswoman said the increased strikes represented a “warning” and did not mean Hezbollah has decided to enter the war.With the situation in Gaza growing increasingly desperate, the US named David Satterfield, the former US ambassador to Turkiye experienced in Mideast diplomacy, to be special envoy for Middle East humanitarian issues.US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Sunday that Satterfield will focus on getting humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in Gaza.Hospitals in Gaza are expected to run out of generator fuel within two days, endangering the lives of thousands of patients.According to the UN Gaza's sole power plant shut down for lack of fuel after Israel completely sealed off the 40-kilometer (25-mile) long territory following the Hamas attack.In Nasser Hospital, in the southern town of Khan Younis, intensive care rooms were packed with wounded patients, most of them children under the age of 3.Hundreds of people with severe blast injuries have come to the hospital, where fuel is expected to run out by Monday, said Dr. Mohammed Qandeel, a consultant at the critical care complex.There were 35 patients in the ICU who require ventilators and another 60 on dialysis. If fuel runs out, “it means the whole health system will be shut down”, he said, as children moaned in pain in the background. “All these patients are in danger of death if the electricity is cut off.\"Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, the head of pediatrics at the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, said the facility did not evacuate despite Israeli orders. There were seven newborns in the ICU hooked up to ventilators, he said. Evacuating “would mean death for them and other patients under our care.”Ahmed Al-Mandhari, the regional director of the World Health Organisation, said hospitals were able to move some mobile patients out of the north, but most patients can't be evacuated, he said.Shifa hospital in Gaza City, the territory's largest, said it would bury 100 bodies in a mass grave as an emergency measure after its morgue overflowed. Tens of thousands of people seeking safety have gathered in the hospital compound.Gaza was already in a humanitarian crisis due to a growing shortage of water and medical supplies caused by the Israeli siege.“An unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding under our eyes,” said Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees.Sullivan told CNN that Israeli officials told him they had turned the water back on in southern Gaza. Israel's minister of energy and water, Israel Katz, said in a statement that water had been restored at one “specific point” in Gaza. A spokesman said the location was outside Khan Younis. Aid workers in Gaza said they had not yet seen evidence the water was back.Israel has ordered more than 1 million Palestinians — almost half the territory's population — to move south. The military says it is trying to clear away civilians ahead of a major campaign against Hamas in the north, where it says the militants have extensive networks of tunnels, bunkers and rocket launchers.Hamas urged people to stay in their homes, and the Israeli military released photos it said showed a Hamas roadblock preventing traffic from moving south.Nevertheless, more than 600,000 people had evacuated the Gaza City area, said Israel's chief military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari.The US has been trying to broker a deal to reopen Egypt's Rafah crossing with Gaza to allow Americans and other foreigners to leave and humanitarian aid amassed on the Egyptian side to be brought in. The crossing, which was closed because of airstrikes early in the war, has yet to reopen.Israel has said the siege will only be lifted when the ca\n",

      "Israel escalated its bombardment of targets in the Gaza Strip, the military said on Tuesday, ahead of an expected ground invasion against Hamas militants that the US fears could spark a wider conflict in the region, including attacks on American troops.The stepped-up attacks, and the rapidly rising death toll in Gaza, came as Hamas released two elderly Israeli women who were among the hundreds of hostages it captured during its devastating October 7 attack on towns in southern Israel.Amid a flurry of diplomatic activity in Israel since the war started, French President Emmanuel Macron arrived in Tel Aviv on Tuesday, meeting with the families of others held hostage in Gaza before heading to talks with top Israeli officials.Gaza's 2.3 million people have been running out of food, water and medicine since Israel sealed off the territory following the attack. A third small aid convoy entered Gaza on Monday carrying only a tiny fraction of the cargo aid groups say is necessary.With Israel still barring the entry of fuel, the United Nations said aid distribution would soon grind to a halt when it can no longer fuel trucks inside Gaza. Hospitals overwhelmed by the wounded are struggling to keep generators running to power lifesaving medical equipment and incubators for premature babies.The two freed hostages, 85-year-old Yocheved Lifshitz and 79-year-old Nurit Cooper, were taken out of Gaza at the Rafah crossing into Egypt, where they were put into ambulances, according to footage shown on Egyptian TV. The women, along with their husbands, were snatched from their homes in the kibbutz of Nir Oz near the Gaza border. Their husbands, ages 83 and 84, were not released.“While I cannot put into words the relief that she is now safe, I will remain focused on securing the release of my father and all those — some 200 innocent people — who remain hostages in Gaza,” Lifshitz' daughter, Sharone Lifschitz, said in a statement.The women were freed days after an American woman and her teenage daughter. Hamas and other militants in Gaza are believed to have taken roughly 220 people, including an unconfirmed number of foreigners and dual citizens.Lifschitz, an artist and academic in London who spells her name differently to her parents, told reporters last week that her parents were peace activists, and her father would drive to the Gaza border to take Palestinians to east Jerusalem for medical treatment.Kindness, she said last week, could somehow save them.“I grew up, you know, with all these Holocaust stories about how all my uncles' lives were saved because” of acts of kindness, she said.“Do I want that to be the story here?” she asked. “Yeah.”On Monday, Hamas released a video showing the handover, with militants giving drinks and snacks to the dazed but composed women, and holding their hands as they are walked to Red Cross officials. Just before the video ends, Lifshitz reaches back to shake one militant's hand.Around the same time, Israel's internal security service, Shin Bet, released a recording showing Hamas prisoners — most in clean prison uniforms, but one in a bloody t-shirt and at least one wincing in pain — sitting handcuffed in drab offices talking about the October 7 attack. The men said they were under orders to kill young men, and kidnap women, children and the elderly, and that they'd been promised financial rewards.The Associated Press could not independently verify either video, and both the hostages and the prisoners could have been acting under duress.The fighting as killed more than 1,400 people in Israel — mostly civilians slain during the initial Hamas attack.More than 5,000 Palestinians, including some 2,000 minors and around 1,100 women, have been killed, the Hamas-run Health Ministry said. That includes the disputed toll from an explosion at a hospital last week. The toll has climbed rapidly in recent days, with the ministry reporting 436 additional deaths in just the last 24 hours.On Tuesday, Israel said it had launched 400 airstrikes over the past day, killing Hamas commanders, hitting militants as they were preparing to launch rockets into Israel and striking command centers and a Hamas tunnel shaft. The previous day, Israel reported 320 strikes. The Palestinian official news agency, WAFA, said many of the airstrikes hit residential buildings, some of them in southern Gaza where Israel had told civilians to take shelter, causing many casualties and trapping people under rubble.Fifteen members of the same family were among at least 33 Palestinians buried Monday in a shallow, sandy mass grave at a Gaza hospital after being killed in Israeli airstrikes.Men discussed where to fit the shrouded corpse of a small child.Israel says it does not target civilians and says Hamas militants are using them as cover for their attacks. Palestinian militants have fired over 7,000 rockets at Israel since the start of the war, Israel said.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas. Iranian-backed fighters around the region are warning of possible escalation, including the targeting of US forces deployed in the Mideast, if a ground offensive is launched.The US has told Iranian-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon and other groups not to join the fight. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire almost daily across the Israel-Lebanon border, and Israeli warplanes have struck targets in Syria, Lebanon and the occupied West Bank in recent days.National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said there has been an uptick in rocket and drone attacks by Iranian-backed militias on US troops in Iraq and Syria, and the US was “deeply concerned about the possibility for any significant escalation” in the coming days.He said US officials were having “active conversations” with Israeli counterparts about the potential ramifications of escalated military action.The US advised Israeli officials that delaying a ground offensive would give Washington more time to work with regional mediators on the release of more hostages, according to a US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were authorized to reveal sensitive negotiations.At least 1.4 million Palestinians in Gaza have fled their homes, and nearly 580,000 of them are sheltering in UN-run schools and shelters, the UN said Monday.\n",

      "Religiosity woven into war has the automatic effect of rendering the ensuing bloodshed all the more bitter. The results are devastatingThe world is used to the spectacle of scholars, academics and social and political activists propagating and conferencing for global peace, but it is increasingly difficult to dismiss the notion that peace is little more than an uneasy halt between wars. While civilians somehow cling to some unreal hope, those in charge of the political destinies talk of peace, but actually build and sharpen the weaponry for the next bout.In the land of origin of the three Abrahamic faiths, Judaism, Christianity and Islam, peace is currently the biggest casualty. Virtually everyone is concerned about the Israel-Hamas war. One, however, does almost immediately ponder as to how Tel Aviv was caught by utter surprise. Needless to add, the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad has been reputed to be one of the most efficient in the world, possibly the best spy agency.On balance, it appears that Hamas was conscious that there are groups within Israel that desire the Jewish homeland and country to further expand into a Greater Israel, as large and great as possible. Undoubtedly, the Hamas leaders themselves yearn to wipe the Jewish nation out of existence. Curiously, like in love, so in hate; such desires are mutual. With the help of friends and allies, it is likely that Hamas has been, for a long time planning to strike a ‘grand slam’ at their Jewish neighbour.Just as the Israeli leaders would like to get rid of Hamas from the country’s neighbourhood. All of this lays the grounds for a conflict before the end of which the other side would supposedly be wiped out. A wounded enemy is more dangerous than one who hasn’t been wounded. A grand slam, so to say, might have been thought to be necessary. The question is whether Israel too sees the Hamas invasion and barbarity as a great opportunity for “setting things right” in the Middle East.An organized state in Tel Aviv would certainly be functioning round the clock and would not give its adversaries any chance to destroy it. As luck would have it, Hamas perceived that its Jewish neighbour was divided over the political divide over the issue of judicial powers enjoyed by the country’s Supreme Court. They needed to be reduced or restrained so that the democratically elected Knesset or Parliament could assert its will more effectively.While the members of the Knesset could not readily reach a settlement, the people of the country took over and protested through public meetings and processions. Such scenes had not been seen ever before and were being played out again and again, on the streets of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. When the adversary is divided, it is human nature for the other side to smell an opportunity.As we have discussed, the desire of Hamas has been intense. The images of an Israel divided in the streets of its cities would certainly have held out the temptation, to believe that this was the opportunity. A terrorist organization like Hamas is unlikely to be foresighted. In fact, terrorism per se can seldom win. For the simple reason that its adventures, however violent and apparently successful, do not capture territory. And without territory, there is no lasting victory. And yet, terrorist after terrorist gives up his life, merely to temporarily devastate places and people. Evidently, such men or women cannot be far-sighted. To expect the Hamas to be, therefore, to have vision is to expect a bat to have eyesight. Regardless, the attacks launched by Hamas on October 7 Bloody Saturday were thoughtless, to say the least. The consequences from Sunday onwards were foreseeable and yet, were not seen by the terrorist fighters of Hamas. It is not impossible that their escape route may, in an eventuality, be the Mediterranean Sea.On the other hand, Hamas has gifted Israel with a justification to blame any country or organisation it chooses as a partner-in-crime that expresses even minimal sympathy for Hamas. Israel would also, and not without reason, feel justified to heap destruction on not any the Hamas but also the palaces of Qatar (which reportedly funds Hamas to some extent) and Iran’s nuclear toys, as well as bomb places in Syria, most of which are in ruins anyway because of the latter’s civil war. Fortunately for Israel, ammunition has begun flying in from the USA; if necessary, even weapons would flow in. When Israel’s Prime Minister says that his country will change the Middle East, he isn’t bluffing.Unfortunately, Israel—and India too—has been battling enemies who look upon war as a religious duty. Religiosity woven into war has the automatic effect of rendering the ensuing bloodshed all the more bitter. Such religious beliefs hold the promise of an eternal heaven with unending gratification of one’s natural lust, in the pursuit of which the adherents of those dogmas have little hesitation in unleashing hell on earth.For India, tightening our security, internal and external, in the wake of the war in Gaza will be imperative, for Hamas’ initial boldness could well embolden elements in Pakistan to try something similar. This time, the Arab states have not supported Hamas, as several of them are seeking better relations with Israel and a different future.(The writer is a well-known columnist, an author, and a former member of the Rajya Sabha.

      "For Palestinians in Gaza, Israel's eyes are never very far away. Surveillance drones buzz constantly from the skies. The highly-secured border is awash with security cameras and soldiers on guard. Intelligence agencies work sources and cyber capabilities to draw out a bevy of information.But Israel's eyes appeared to have been closed in the lead-up to an unprecedented onslaught by the militant Hamas group, which broke down Israeli border barriers and sent hundreds of militants into Israel to carry out a brazen attack that has killed hundreds and pushed the region toward conflict.Israel's intelligence agencies have gained an aura of invincibility over the decades because of a string of achievements. Israel has foiled plots seeded in the West Bank, allegedly hunted down Hamas operatives in Dubai and has been accused of killing Iranian nuclear scientists in the heart of Iran. Even when their efforts have stumbled, agencies like the Mossad, Shin Bet and military intelligence have maintained their mystique.But the weekend's assault, which caught Israel off guard on a major Jewish holiday, plunges that reputation into doubt and raises questions about the country's readiness in the face of a weaker but determined foe. Over 24 hours later, Hamas militants continued to battle Israeli forces inside Israeli territory, and dozens of Israelis were in Hamas captivity in Gaza.“This is a major failure,” said Yaakov Amidror, a former national security adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “This operation actually proves that the (intelligence) abilities in Gaza were no good.”Amidror declined to offer an explanation for the failure, saying lessons must be learned when the dust settles.Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the chief military spokesman, acknowledged the army owes the public an explanation. But he said now is not the time. “First, we fight, then we investigate,” he said.Some say it is too early to pin the blame solely on an intelligence fault. They point to a wave of low-level violence in the West Bank that shifted some military resources there and the political chaos roiling Israel over steps by Netanyahu's far-right government to overhaul the judiciary. The controversial plan has threatened the cohesion of the country's powerful military.But the apparent lack of prior knowledge of Hamas' plot will likely be seen as a prime culprit in the chain of events that led to the deadliest attack against Israelis in decades.Israel withdrew troops and settlers from the Gaza Strip in 2005, stripping it of a close handle on the happenings in the territory. But even after Hamas overran Gaza in 2007, Israel appeared to maintain its edge, using technological and human intelligence.It claimed to know the precise locations of Hamas leadership and appeared to prove it through the assassinations of militant leaders in surgical strikes, sometimes while they slept in their bedrooms. Israel has known where to strike underground tunnels used by Hamas to ferry around fighters and arms, destroying miles (kilometers) of the concealed passageways.Despite those abilities, Hamas was able to keep its plan under wraps. The ferocious attack, which likely took months of planning and meticulous training and involved coordination among multiple militant groups, appeared to have gone under Israel's intelligence radar.Amir Avivi, a retired Israeli general, said that without a foothold inside Gaza, Israel's security services have come to rely increasingly on technological means to gain intelligence. He said militants in Gaza have found ways to evade that technological intelligence gathering, giving Israel an incomplete picture of their intentions.“The other side learned to deal with our technological dominance and they stopped using technology that could expose it,” said Avivi, who served as a conduit for intelligence materials under a former military chief of staff. Avivi is president and founder of Israel Defense and Security Forum, a hawkish group of former military commanders.“They've gone back to the Stone Age,” he said, explaining that militants weren't using phones or computers and were conducting their sensitive business in rooms specially guarded from technological espionage or going underground.But Avivi said the failure extends beyond just intelligence gathering and Israel's security services failed to put together an accurate picture from the intelligence they were receiving, based on what he said was a misconception surrounding Hamas' intentions.Israel's security establishment has in recent years increasingly seen Hamas as an actor interested in governing, seeking to develop Gaza's economy and improving the standard of living of Gaza's 2.3 million people. Avivi and others say the truth is that Hamas, which calls for Israel's destruction, still sees that aim as its priority.Israel in recent years has allowed up to 18,000 Palestinian laborers from Gaza to work in Israel, where they can earn a salary about 10 times higher than in the impoverished coastal enclave. The security establishment saw that carrot as a way to maintain relative calm.“In practice, hundreds if not thousands of Hamas men were preparing for a surprise attack for months, without that having leaked,” wrote Amos Harel, a defense commentator, in the daily Haaretz. “The results are catastrophic.”Allies who share intelligence with Israel said security agencies were misreading reality.An Egyptian intelligence official said Egypt, which often serves as a mediator between Israel and Hamas, had spoken repeatedly with the Israelis about “something big,” without elaborating.He said Israeli officials were focused on the West Bank and played down the threat from Gaza. Netanyahu's government is made up of supporters of Jewish West Bank settlers who have demanded a security crackdown in the face of a rising tide of violence there over the last 18 months.“We have warned them an explosion of the situation is coming, and very soon, and it would be big. But they underestimated such warnings,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to discuss the content of sensitive intelligence discussions with the media.Israel has also been preoccupied and torn apart by Netanyahu's judicial overhaul plan. Netanyahu had received repeated warnings by his defense chiefs, as well as several former leaders of the country's intelligence agencies, that the divisive plan was chipping away at the cohesion of the country's security services.Martin Indyk, who served as a special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations during the Obama administration, said internal divisions over the legal changes was an aggravating factor that contributed to the Israelis being caught off guard.\"That roiled the IDF in a way that was, I think, we discovered was a huge distraction,” he said.\n",

      "President Joe Biden has visited Israel on an urgent mission to keep the Israel-Hamas war from spiraling into a broader regional conflict. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday that limited humanitarian aid would be allowed into Gaza from Egypt following a request from Biden.The president's visit came after hundreds of people were reported killed in an explosion at a Gaza Strip hospital. There were conflicting claims of who was responsible for the hospital blast. Officials in Gaza quickly blamed an Israeli airstrike. Israel denied it was involved and released a flurry of video, audio and other information that it said showed the blast was due to a missile misfire by Islamic Jihad, another militant group operating in Gaza. The Islamic Jihad dismissed that claim.The Associated Press has not independently verified any of the claims or evidence released by the parties.The war that began Oct. 7 has become the deadliest of five Gaza wars for both sides. The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry said Wednesday that 3,478 Palestinians have been killed and more than 12,000 injured in the past 11 days.More than 1,400 people in Israel have been killed, and at least 199 others, including children, were captured by Hamas and taken into Gaza, according to Israeli authorities.Currently:1. Biden says the U.S. Will provide $100 million in humanitarian assistance for Palestinians affected by conflict in Gaza and the West Bank.2. Egypt and other Arab countries typically don't want to take in Palestinian refugees.3. Relatives of people taken hostage by Hamas militants tell their stories as they hope for their safe return.4. The U.S. Has vetoed a proposed U.N. Resolution to condemn violence against civilians in the Israel-Hamas war.5. Rage at the Gaza hospital blast carnage spread throughout the Middle East.Here's what's happening in the latest Israel-Hamas war:AIRSTRIKE KILLS 7 SMALL CHILDREN IN GAZA HOME, RESIDENTS AND DOCTORS SAYKHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — Residents and doctors in this southern Gaza town said an airstrike slammed into a home, killing seven small children.The news spread quickly on social media, as grisly images of dead and bloodied toddlers lined up side by side on a hospital stretcher stirred outrage in Gaza and the West Bank.Bandaged and caked in dust, the bodies were brought to the Gaza European Hospital in Khan Younis along with three other dead members of the Bakri family. Photographers swarmed the operation room as women covered their eyes and doctors wept.“This is a massacre,” hospital director Dr. Yousef Al-Akkad said, his voice choking with emotion. “Let the world see, these are just children.”Local medics also confirmed that the children were killed in a strike and said the Bakri family was just one of many such cases Wednesday.There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.LIVERPOOL AND EGYPT STAR SALAH URGES LEADERS TO PREVENT MORE BLOODSHED, GET HUMANITARIAN AID TO GAZACAIRO — Egyptian soccer star Mohamed Salah, arguably the most celebrated Arab footballer, called on world leaders to “come together to prevent further slaughter of all innocent souls” and for the urgent delivery of humanitarian aid to the people in Gaza.“There has been too much violence and too much heartbreak and brutality,” the Liverpool striker said in a video that lasted a little under a minute. “The escalations in the recent weeks is unbearable to witness. All lives are sacred and must be protected. The massacres need to stop. Families are being torn apart.”Aid to Gaza “must be allowed immediately,” he added. “The people there are in terrible conditions.”They were Salah's first comments on the Israel-Hamas war, after he was criticized by some Arab fans for his silence.Officials said Wednesday that some aid will begin flowing into Gaza in the coming days.US SENATORS SAY AFTER CLASSIFIED BRIEFING THAT ISRAEL NOT BEHIND HOSPITAL BLASTWASHINGTON — Senators who attended a classified briefing with top defense, intelligence and other administration officials said they were briefed that Israel was not responsible for the hospital blast.“The intelligence community assesses that Israel is not to blame for the explosion of the hospital in Gaza,” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said as he left. “They believe it was an errant rocket from terrorists in Gaza.”Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said the intelligence is “definitive” that it was not an Israeli operation.In a joint statement earlier, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the panel, said they reviewed intelligence and “feel confident that the explosion was the result of a failed rocket launch by militant terrorists and not the result of an Israeli airstrike.”UN OFFICIALS WARN OVER GAZA HEALTH SYSTEM, RISK OF CONFLICT EXPANDINGUNITED NATIONS – U.N. Humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council that the deadly destruction of a hospital has heaped further pressure on Gaza's crumbling health system, depriving the territory of a facility that cared for 45,000 patients every year.Speaking in a video briefing from Qatar, Griffiths also said the Al Ahli hospital was previously struck on Oct. 14.He also said the death toll in the 11 days since Hamas' surprise attack inside Israel has already exceeded what was seen during seven weeks of Israeli-Hamas hostilities in 2014.Meanwhile the U.N. Mideast envoy warned that the risk of the conflict expanding is “very real and extremely dangerous.”Tor Wennesland told the council that recent events “have served to reignite grievances and re-animate alliances across the region.”Earlier in the day at the U.N., the United States vetoed a resolution that would have condemned violence against civilians in the Israel-Hamas war and pushed for humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza.U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said President Joe Biden was in the region engaging in diplomacy and “We need to let that diplomacy play out.”BRITISH PM RISHI SUNAK HEADS TO MIDDLE EAST IN BID TO CONTAIN CONFLICTLONDON — British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is flying to Israel and nearby countries as part of diplomatic efforts to stop the crisis triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack from worsening.Sunak's office says he will meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog on Thursday. He will condemn Hamas' “horrific act of terror” and express condolences for the “terrible loss of life” in both Israel and Gaza.He'll also visit “a number of other regional capitals,” Downing Street said, without providing details.The British leader's trip follows a visit to Israel on Wednesday by U.S. President Joe Biden.Sunak said in a statement that Tuesday's explosion at the al-Ahli hospital in Gaza “should be a watershed moment for leaders in the region and across the world to come together to avoid further dangerous escalation of conflict.”U.K. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly is also on a regional visit beginning with talks in Egypt on Thursday.

Biden was speaking to reporters on Air Force One during a refueling stop in Germany on his way back to the U.S. From Tel Aviv.Israel sealed off the Gaza Strip, stopping all entry of food, water, medicine and fuel to its 2.3 million people following the Hamas attack on Oct. 7.White House officials said the aid would flow in the coming days. Biden said if Hamas confiscates the aid, “it will end.”Earlier in the day, the United States promised $100 million in humanitarian assistance to help Palestinian people who have been displaced or otherwise affected by conflict in Gaza and the West Bank.SECURITY FORCES ARREST DOZENS, FIRE LIVE ROUNDS TO DISPERSE PROTESTS IN THE OCCUPIED WEST BANKJERUSALEM — Rights groups in the occupied West Bank say Palestinian security forces arrested dozens of Palestinians protesting the deadly explosion at al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza.The protests late Tuesday devolved into skirmishes with Palestinian security forces, who fired tear gas, stun grenades and live fire to disperse stone-throwing demonstrators, wounding several.Lawyers for Justice, a legal aid group, said Wednesday that some 50 protesters were arrested overnight by Palestinian security forces in Ramallah.The Palestinian Red Crescent meanwhile reported that Israeli soldiers using live rounds and rubber bullets shot and wounded 10 Palestinian protesters in the southern city of Hebron and 21 people in the northern city of Nablus. A 24-year-old Palestinian man was killed, according to the organization.PROTESTS AROUND THE WORLDThousands demonstrated outside the consulates of Israel and the United States in Istanbul late Wednesday. Many waved Palestinian flags, shouted anti-Israeli slogans and called for revenge against Israel a day after the deadly explosion at a hospital in Gaza.Betul Balcik, a 22-year-old student, told The Associated Press that “humanity is dying” in Gaza and she and friends were there to denounce “war crimes commited by Israel”.Large protests also erupted in Tunisia and Morocco, with demonstrators outraged by the blast at the hospital in Gaza.Protesters gathered outside the Parliament in Rabat chanting “Down with America” and demanding that Morocco reverse its 2020 decision\n",

      "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday expressed shock over the death of nearly 500 people in an attack on a hospital in Gaza and offered condolences to the families of the civilian victims. He also said those involved in this act should be held responsible.“Deeply shocked at the tragic loss of lives at the Al Ahli Hospital in Gaza. Our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims, and prayers for speedy recovery of those injured,” Modi said on X.“Civilian casualties in the ongoing conflict are a matter of serious and continuing concern. Those involved should be held responsible,” the Prime Minister said.  Incidentally, he was one of the first world leaders to call out the October 7 assault by Hamas on Israel as a terror attack.Hostilities between Israel and Hamas began after armed Hamas militants based in the Gaza Strip launched an unprecedented attack on Israel by land, air, and sea on October 7. Since the start of hostilities, as many as 2,778 Palestinians have been killed.Media reports have cited official Israeli sources as saying that at least 1,400 Israelis and foreign nationals have been killed in Israel.In a post soon after Hamas launched 5,000 rockets at Israel in 20 minutes and began a multi-pronged attack by land, air and sea on October 7, Prime Minister Modi had said he was “deeply shocked by the news of terrorist attacks in Israel” and expressed India’s solidarity with the country in the difficult hour.Modi reiterated his support for Israel on October 10, when he had posted that Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had called him and given him an update on the deadly conflict.“I thank Prime Minister @netanyahu for his phone call and providing an update on the ongoing situation. People of India stand firmly with Israel in this difficult hour. India strongly and unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,” Modi posted on X.Speaking at the G20 Parliamentary Speakers’ Summit in New Delhi the same week, Prime Minister Modi said terrorism anywhere in the world and in any form was against humanity and emphasised that it was time for peace and brotherhood.Calling for the world to move forward with a human-centric approach, he also said conflicts and confrontations in any part of the world impact everyone and do not benefit anyone.\n",

      "Describing Hamas as a barbaric terrorist organisation, an Indian American Congressman has said there is a need to eliminate the terror outfit.The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a barrage of rocket attacks in Southern Israel on October 7. The unprecedented assault triggered retaliatory strikes from the Israel Defense Forces.“Hamas is not a militant organisation. Hamas is not a resistance movement. They are just barbaric terrorists. There's no other way to describe it,” Shri Thanedar told a group of eminent Indian-Americans at the US Capitol Hill on Monday.“This is a time where we just can't just push them. Because they will regroup and come back and do these atrocities once again. That's what they will do. So, we need at this stage to eliminate them; eliminate them from the face of this earth,” he said at an event organised by HinduACTion here in support of Israel.“We need to dismantle their military operations. We need to free the Palestinian people, the two million Palestinian people who live in Gaza. They need to be freed from these terrorist control of Gaza,” he said.In a joint declaration, members of various faiths who attended the event urged the US Congress to develop comprehensive policies to enhance and guarantee the safety and security of Hindus, Sikhs, Jews, Hazara and Yezidi communities on college campuses.The declaration urged the US Congress to strengthen laws to protect Jewish staff and students against rising anti-Semitism on American campuses. It also appealed to the Congress to recognise Hinduphobia, formulate laws to counter growing anti-Hindu bigotry and targeted Hinduphobia.Thanedar, who recently formed the Congressional Caucus for Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains, said that there are increasing instances of Hinduphobia in the country.\n",

      "Palestinians scrambled to flee northern Gaza after Israel's military urged about 1 million people to leave for the territory's south ahead of an expected ground invasion following the surprise attack a week ago by the ruling Hamas militant group — despite warnings from the U.N. That evacuating nearly half of Gaza's population would be calamitous.Families in cars, trucks and donkey carts packed with their possessions crowded a main road southward from Gaza City as Israeli airstrikes hammered the territory Friday. Hamas' media office said warplanes struck cars fleeing south, killing more than 70 people.The Israeli military said its troops conducted temporary raids into Gaza to battle militants and hunted for traces of some 150 people abducted in Hamas's assault on Israel nearly a week ago.In urging the evacuation, Israel's military said it planned to target underground Hamas hideouts around Gaza City. But Palestinians and some Egyptian officials fear that Israel ultimately hopes to push Gaza's people out through the southern border with Egypt.The U.N. Called on Israel to reverse the unprecedented directive. But Israel's military said it planned to target underground Hamas hideouts around Gaza City.Hamas told people to ignore the evacuation order. Families in Gaza faced what they saw as a no-win decision to leave or stay, with no safe ground anywhere. Israeli strikes have levelled large swaths of neighbourhoods, and Gaza has been sealed off from food, water and medical supplies — all under a virtual total power blackout.“Forget about food, forget about electricity, forget about fuel. The only concern now is just if you'll make it, if you're going to live,” said Nebal Farsakh, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent in Gaza City, as she broke into heaving sobs.In the week-old war, the Gaza Health Ministry said Friday that roughly 1,900 people have been killed in the territory. The Hamas assault last Saturday killed more than 1,300 Israelis, most of whom were civilians, and roughly 1,500 Hamas militants were killed during the fighting, the Israeli government said.ISRAELI TROOPS MAKE FORAY INTO GAZAIsrael's raid Friday was the first word of troops entering Gaza since Israel's round-the-clock bombardment in retaliation for Hamas' massacre of hundreds of civilians in southern Israel.A military spokesman said Israeli ground troops left after conducting the raids. The troop movements did not appear to be the beginning of an expected ground invasion.The evacuation order was taken as a further signal of an expected Israeli ground offensive, although no such decision has been announced.Israel has been massing troops along the Gaza border, although no decision on a ground offensive has been announced.An assault into densely populated and impoverished Gaza would likely bring even higher casualties on both sides in brutal house-to-house fighting.“We will destroy Hamas,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Friday night in a speech.Hamas said Israel's airstrikes killed 13 hostages. It said the dead included foreigners but did not give their nationalities. Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari denied the claim.In Israel, the public is overwhelmingly in favour of a military offensive, and Israeli TV stations have set up special broadcasts with slogans like “together we will win” and “strong together.” Their reports focus heavily on the aftermath of the Hamas attack and stories of heroism and national unity, and they make scant mention of the unfolding crisis in Gaza.In the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian Health Ministry reported 16 Palestinians were killed Friday, bringing the total of Palestinians killed there to 51. The U.N. Says attacks by Israeli settlers have surged there since the Hamas assault.ISRAEL URGES MASS EVACUATION OF GAZA CIVILIANSThe U.N. Said the Israeli military's call for civilians to move south affects 1.1 million people. If carried out, that would mean the territory's entire population would have to cram into the southern half of the 40-kilometer strip.An Israeli spokesperson, Jonathan Conricus, said the military would take “extensive efforts to avoid harming civilians” and that residents would be allowed to return when the war is over.Israel has long accused Hamas of using Palestinians as human shields. Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Israel wanted to separate Hamas militants from the civilian population.“So those who want to save their life, please go south,” he said at a news conference with U.S. Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin.U.N. Spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said it would be impossible to stage such an evacuation without “devastating humanitarian consequences.”PALESTINIANS IN GAZA GRAPPLE WITH WHERE TO GOHamas' media office said airstrikes hit cars in three locations as they headed south from Gaza City, killing 70 people. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the strikes.Two witnesses reported a strike on fleeing cars near the town of Deir el-Balah, south of the evacuation zone and in the area Israel told people to flee to. Fayza Hamoudi said she and her family were driving from their home in the north when the strike hit some distance ahead on the road and two vehicles burst into flames. A witness from another car on the road gave a similar account.“Why should we trust that they're trying to keep us safe?” Hamoudi said, her voice choking. “They are sick.”The Israeli military did not respond to a request for comment on the strike.Many feared they would not be able to return or would be gradually displaced to Egypt's Sinai Peninsula.More than half of the Palestinians in Gaza are descendants of refugees from the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when hundreds of thousands fled or were expelled from what is now Israel. For many, the evacuation order dredged up fears of a second expulsion. Already, at least 4,23,000 people — nearly 1 in 5 Gazans — have been forced from their homes by Israeli airstrikes, the U.N. Said Thursday.“Where is the sense of security in Gaza? Is this what Hamas is offering us?” said one resident, Tarek Mraish, standing by an avenue as vehicles flowed by.The U.N. Estimated that tens of thousands had fled homes in the north by Friday night.HOSPITALS STRUGGLE WITH PATIENTSGaza's Health Ministry said it was impossible to safely transport the many wounded from hospitals, which are already struggling with high numbers of dead and injured. “We cannot evacuate hospitals and leave the wounded and sick to die,” spokesperson Ashraf al-Qidra said.Farsakh, of the Palestinian Red Crescent, said some medics refused to abandon patients and instead called colleagues to say goodbye.“We have wounded, we have elderly, we have children who are in hospitals,” she said.Al Awda Hospital struggled to evacuate dozens of patients and staff after the military contacted it and told it to do so by Friday night, said the aid group Doctors Without Borders, which supports the facility. The military extended the deadline to Saturday morning, it said.The U.N. Agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, said it would not evacuate its schools, where hundreds of thousands have taken shelter. But it relocated its headquarters to southern Gaza, according to spokesperson Juliette Touma.“The scale and speed of the unfolding humanitarian crisis is bone-chilling. Gaza is fast becoming a hellhole and is on the brink of collapse,” said Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA's commissioner general.\n",

      "Aid deliveries have begun moving into the besieged Gaza Strip, two weeks after the militant group Hamas rampaged through southern Israel and Israel responded with airstrikes.Israel says Hamas has freed two American hostages who had been held in Gaza since the war began Oct. 7. Israeli airstrikes continued to hit southern Gaza, an area swollen by civilians who fled there from the north on Israeli instructions. Israel's military spokesman said the country is stepping up its attacks, coming amid growing expectations of a ground offensive.The war, in its 16th day Sunday, is the deadliest of five Gaza wars for both sides. The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry said Saturday that the death toll has reached 4,385, while 13,561 people have been wounded.More than 1,400 people in Israel have been killed, mostly in the initial attack on Oct. 7 when Hamas militants stormed into Israel. In addition, 203 people were believed captured by Hamas during the incursion and taken into Gaza, the Israeli military has said.Currently:1. The father of freed American teenage hostage Natalie Raanan, who spoke with President Joe Biden on Saturday, says she's doing well after her release by Hamas.2. Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators are marching in London, Barcelona, Los Angeles and other cities.3. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is ordering further defenses for U.S. Troops as tensions in the Middle East continue to grow.4. A tent camp for displaced Palestinians in southern Gaza reawakens old traumas.Here's what's happening in the latest Israel-Hamas war:U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY ORDERS MORE DEFENSE SYSTEMS IN MIDDLE EASTU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced late Saturday he was sending additional air defense systems to the Middle East as well as putting more troops on prepare-to-deploy orders.Austin said the U.S. Would be delivering a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, battery along with additional Patriot missile defense system batteries “to locations throughout the region to increase force protection for U.S. Troops.” Bases in Iraq and Syria have been repeatedly targeted by drones in the days since hundreds were killed in a hospital blast in Gaza, and the destroyer USS Carney intercepted land attack cruise missiles in the Red Sea shot from Yemen on Thursday.Austin said he had also placed additional forces on prepare-to-deploy orders, “part of prudent contingency planning” as the U.S. And others brace for the potential of a wider regional conflict and as Israel prepares to launch a ground assault into Gaza. He said he gave the orders after detailed discussions with President Joe Biden on the recent escalations by Iran and its proxy forces across the region.ISRAEL STRIKES UNDERGROUND COMPOUND AT WEST BANK MOSQUE, MILITARY SAYSIsraeli Defense Forces said a military aircraft launched a strike early Sunday on the Al-Ansar mosque at the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank.The IDF said via X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, that Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants had been using an “underground terror route” beneath the mosque. One Palestinian was killed in the shelling, Palestinian Red Crescent said.Tensions have risen in the West Bank, where dozens of Palestinians have been killed in clashes with Israeli troops, arrest raids and attacks by Jewish settlers.ITALIAN PREMIER GOES TO ISRAELROME — Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni has made a trip to Israel to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, her office said.The meeting Saturday came after Meloni participated in a summit in Cairo focused on ways to de-escalate the raging Israel-Hamas war.Meloni's office said that in her meeting she reiterated “the right of Israel to defend itself under international law and to live in peace” while also underlining \"the importance of guaranteeing humanitarian access to Gaza and a prospect of peace for the region.'Her office said she brought “a message of solidary and Italy's closeness” following Hamas' unprecedented attack on Oct. 7.PRESIDENT BIDEN SPEAKS WITH 2 FREED HOSTAGESWASHINGTON — President Joe Biden has spoken on the phone with two freed Americans who had been held hostage by Hamas in Gaza.Judith Raanan and her 17-year-old daughter, Natalie, were released Friday. It was the first such hostage release from among the roughly 200 people the militant group abducted from Israel during its Oct. 7 rampage.Video of Biden speaking with them by phone was posted Saturday on the X platform, formerly known as Twitter. He told the mother and daughter that he was glad they had been released.“We're going to get them all out, God willing,” he said.Natalie thanked Biden for his “services” to Israel. Judith said they are in good health.Hamas said it released the mother and daughter for humanitarian reasons in an agreement with the Qatari government.Family members have said Judith and Natalie had been on a trip from their home in the Chicago suburb of Evanston to Israel to celebrate Judith's mother's birthday and the Jewish holidays.\n",

      "The escalating conflict between Israel and Hamas has become a critical juncture in the West Asian region. Hamas’ audacious attack has exposed vulnerabilities in Israel’s security apparatus, triggering a humanitarian crisis. Controversial evacuation orders have rekindled memories of historic displacements. As tensions mount, there are growing concerns about the potential for a broader regional crisis.Hamas has surprised the State of Israel by launching one of the deadliest terror attacks on it last week, since its foundation in 1948. This brazen assault by the terror group is viewed as a turning point in Israel-Palestinian conflict. The multi-pronged war is now seen as long planned and clearly failed the sophisticated Israeli security network, known for decades for its stealth work and extensive espionage activities against its enemies like Hamas and Hezbollah.This crisis is crucial for the US. No US President can ignore a conflict in which Israel is at stake or directly involved in the war. Also, for President Joe Biden, who is fighting re-election next year, the quagmire in West Asia is decisive. This crisis is virtually challenging the world order led by the US, since the end of the Second World War and the establishment of the UN.Well, Hamas knows its limits. And Israel can easily assess how far it can push. With an annual military aid of about $3 billion to the country, the Israelis will be giving a tough fight to Hamas. Only time will tell how the current crisis unfolds and how bloodier and costlier it is going to be. But for sure, it will lead to one of the most serious humanitarian tragedies in recent days in West Asia.Who is Hamas? Hamas is a Palestinian Sunni militant group that was founded on December 10, 1987, after the first intifada (uprising). Its name is an acronym which comes from Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya. Its English translation means Islamic Resistance Movement.For Hamas, the main objectives since its inception have been the creation of an independent Palestine state and the destruction of the Israeli state. It will fight till the end. However, sustaining a prolonged conflict with an armed Israel would inevitably lead to further loss of lives, both in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, in the days to come.Is it possible for Israel to fortify the nation adequately? It is an extremely challenging task for any nation, including Israel. Israel has been under threat from all its neighbours since its inception. However, the country has built an excellent security system over the years to counter attacks from non-state actors like Hamas and Hezbollah. This attack by Hamas indicates a near-total security and intelligence failure on Israel’s part, as experts suggest.Meanwhile, there has been a deluge of international reaction to the ongoing war between Hamas and Israel. The international victims of assault on Israel by Hamas come from the US, the UK, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Austria, Canada, Thailand, Nepal, the Philippines, Cambodia, China, Tanzania, Brazil, Paraguay, Mexico, etc.It is certain that Gaza Strip will soon turn into a hotspot of humanitarian tragedy. Israel has asked more than one million Gazans to vacate the North Gaza in no time and to move towards the south. But the UN says the Israeli evacuation order is impossible without a major humanitarian catastrophe.The UN also warns that Gaza is becoming a “hell hole on the brink of collapse” signalling that war clouds hovering over the Gaza Strip, the people might face all the hardships simply to survive. On the other hand, Hamas told Gazans not to leave their homes.By now, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is deepening, as Israel has already cut off food and electricity to the besieged territory. Most of the common people are at risk of starvation. According to the estimate from the Palestinian Ministry of Health, more than 1,800 people have died so far. The UN reports that over 4,23,000 people are internally displaced due to the massive air raids conducted by the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) since October 7.US President Joe Biden strongly criticised Hamas for its military mission against Israel. In an official message delivered immediately after the offensive, he said, “We are with Israel. Let us make no mistake.” He further emphasised that Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people’s right to dignity and self-determination. Its stated purpose is the annihilation of the State of Israel and the murder of Jewish people.However, Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin has criticised Israel for employing “quite cruel methods” in its response to the Hamas attack. He said, “In my view, it is unacceptable. More than two million people live there. Not all of them support Hamas by the way, but all of them have to suffer, including women and children. Of course, it is difficult for anyone to agree with this.”This shows that Putin is fully aware of the chaos left behind by the relentless aerial bombing carried out by Israel over the Gaza Strip.Previously, he also stated that an Israeli ground operation would be entirely unacceptable, as it would result in significant casualties. He advocates for the resolution of this crisis through negotiations, with Russia playing a role in the peace process due to its longstanding relations with both parties. These lofty words coming from a crude statesman who has been at war with his neighbour and creating another global crisis leading to thousands of deaths and displacement of lakhs in Ukraine. Before offering solutions to clash between Hamas and Israel, he must first deescalate the Ukraine crisis that he had started in February 2022.The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, visited Israel and reaffirmed his country’s unwavering support for the latter. However, he also acknowledged the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians that are not represented by Hamas militants. While meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Blinken said, “You may be strong enough to defend yourself on your own. But as long as America exists, you will never ever have to. We will always be there by your side.” This shows how the US is directly providing aid to the Jewish state, while all other Western allies of Israel remain relatively quiet. Washington has taken one step further by sending its Defence Secretary Llyod Austin both to bolster support for Tel Aviv and assure all possible help to its ally.By pledging full support to Israel, Austin said, “This is no time for neutrality, or for false equivalence or for excuses for the inexcusable.”When Blinken met the President of Palestinian Mahmoud Abbas in Jordan, the latter rejected the “forced displacement of the Gazans” from the northern Gaza.He strongly opposed the idea of evacuation and to him such a move would lead to “Second Nakba”. Naqba (Palestinian Catastrophe) is an Arabic word that refers to the catastrophe brought by the creation of the Zionist State in 1948 and the displacement of nearly 7,50,000 Palestinians from their homes.This all happened only after the end of the historic British Mandate and the establishment of Israel on May 14, 1948. This finally resulted in the beginning of the first Arab-Israeli War. Subsequently, the Zionist military forces captured 78 per cent of the historic lands of Palestine and today the remaining 22 per cent are left as the occupied West Bank and the besieged Gaza Strip.So now, with the evacuation of the Northern Gaza as per the order of Israel for beginning its ground offensive to crush Hamas and to rescue the hostages taken might lead to another Naqba.At the moment, the Israeli security forces are conducting local raids in Gaza to locate the hostages taken by Hamas. And as per some media reports, the IDF is able to free nearly 200 hostages from the hands of Hamas so far. The battle is on, and it is certainly going to be bloodier than ever before.The road ahead is complicated and filled with dangerous twists and turns for both Israel and Hamas. There will be no solution until an independent state of Palestine is created. But this will not be feasible given the circumstances that have led to the current hostilities between Israel and Hamas. Furthermore, a counteroffensive by Hezbollah and involvement of nearby Arab nations against Israel might further complicate the situation. However, while dealing with Hamas, the IDF and the Israeli State is careful to minimise civilian casualties. Otherwise, the Israel-Hamas conflict may escalate into a larger regional quagmire.(The writer is currently president of the Global Research Foundation)\n",

      "A case has been registered against Union Minister of State Rajeev Chandrasekhar for allegedly making statements that promote enmity between different groups, a move which was slammed by the BJP on Tuesday.BJP Kerala chief K Surendran alleged that this action by the Pinarayi Vijayan government was aimed at \"helping\" and \"encouraging\" divisive forces and those with extremist views. \"It indicates the double standards of the Pinarayi Vijayan government,\" he said while speaking to reporters in Thiruvananthapuram.The party said it would face the case against the central minister both politically and legally. The Kerala police registered the FIR on its own in connection with the minister's recent statements on social media regarding the Kochi blasts and a Hamas leader's virtual address at an event organised by an Islamist group in Malappuram district of the state recently.A senior officer of Kochi city police said an FIR under sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence) of the IPC and section 120 (o) (causing nuisance and violation of public order) of the Kerala Police Act has been registered against the minister. Surendran also slammed the Left government and the police for not registering a case against CPI(M) state secretary M V Govindan for terming the Kochi bomb blasts as a 'terrorist act.'He also pointed out that no case was registered against IUML MLA M K Muneer and CPI(M) leader M Swaraj for hailing the recent Hamas attack on Israel. The BJP leader further alleged that the government was not ready to register a case against the Islamist group that organised an event in Malappuram district of the state recently where a Hamas leader virtually addressed the gathering. \"But they are registering a case against a central minister who spoke out against the same.This (FIR) is a heinous decision based on vote bank politics. It is aimed at making political gains during the upcoming Lok Sabha elections,\" he alleged. The BJP leader also claimed that the case against the central minister was registered to appease those who are against the country and not those who love the nation. After reports of the bomb blasts at a religious gathering of Jehovah's Witnesses in Kalamassery near here came out on Sunday, Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology Chandrasekhar put up posts on social media platform X criticising Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan.\"Dirty shameless appeasement politics by a discredited CM (and HM) @pinarayivijayan besieged by corruption charges. Sitting in Delhi and protesting against Israel, when in Kerala open calls by Terrorist Hamas for Jihad is causing attacks and bomb blasts on innocent Christians,\" he had said. Following this, a verbal duel took place on Monday between the CM and Chandrasekhar with the BJP leader calling Vijayan a \"liar\" and he in turn lashing out and terming the MoS \"extremely venomous\".The CM also said that if anyone makes statements which are in violation of the law, irrespective of whether they are central or state ministers, cases would be registered against them. Meanwhile, the Congress has lodged a complaint with the State Police Chief against Chandrasekhar, BJP National Secretary Anil K Antony, Govindan, former Ernakulam MP Sebastian Paul, former BJP spokesperson Sandeep G Varier and Trinamool Congress Southern Indian Chapter Convener Riva Tholoor Philip for allegedly making hate comments aimed at flaring up communal enmity in the state. The complaints were made by Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee's (KPCC) Digital Media Cell Convener Sarin P. He has sought appropriate legal action against them for ensuring peace in the state.The blasts were set off at a convention centre in Kalamassery near Kochi where a prayer meeting of the Jehovah's Witnesses -- a Christian religious group that originated in the US in the 19th century -- was held on Sunday.A few hours after that, Martin, who claimed to be an estranged member of Jehovah's Witnesses, surrendered before police in Thrissur district of the state, saying that he carried out the multiple blasts. Initially, one woman had died and 60 were injured, six of them critically, in the blasts.Subsequently, one of the six critically wounded -- a 53-year-old woman -- succumbed to her injuries. By Monday morning, the death toll rose to three with the death of a 12-year-old girl who had suffered 95 per cent burns in the incident.\n",

      "Israel has no choice but to hit back hard but a more serious introspection and recalibration of governance is overdueThe recent Hamas attack on Israel has been a huge blot on Israeli perceptions, not because Hamas will come remotely close to holding onto anything tangible, but due to the abject Israeli failure to pre-empt a strike of such magnitude and intensity. Has too much been romanticised about the Israeli intelligence agencies (Mossad, Aman, Shin Bet etc), their preparedness, or even of its fabled security apparatus that could supposedly deter any attackers?How did Israel not pick the unavoidable assemblage and telltale signs of fighters, weaponry and planning that goes into the execution of such a gargantuan operation? Hamas claims to have fired 5,000 rockets (though Israel suggests half) and breached supposedly well-guarded borders with technologically advanced barriers, replete with concrete, sensors, and cameras etc., Further, these borders were also supposedly always manned by trained and armed patrols. What happened to the apparently impregnable and highly advanced Iron Dome missile system – did it get overwhelmed by the simultaneous barrage of rockets? There were even six to seven paraglider-borne Hamas elements seen flying over Israeli barriers, just as Hamas attempted to cross into Israeli land by sea, with landing vessels. Civilian bulldozers were put into action to demolish the protective electric wire fencing on the border. The meticulously choreographed Hamas sweep was virtually from all directions with pick-up trucks facilitating their racy entry through border breeches.Even politically, it wasn’t as if a pacifist politician e.g., Shimon Peres, or one from a non-military background e.g., Ehud Olmert, Golda Meir or Menachem Begin, was leading the current Israeli dispensation – it is led by the ultra-hawkish Benjamin ‘Bibi’ Netanyahu, who served in the Israel Defence Forces and whose brother is the legendary ‘Yoni’ Netanyahu, who commanded Sayeret Matkal (Special Operation Team) during the daring Entebbe raid, and was the only Israeli fatality in that operation. How did a political leader with such ‘muscular’ politics, positions and commitments lower his guard to such an extent, that it was caught completely by surprise? Has Israel’s historical brazenness in sovereign conduct and defending itself been grossly mistaken for efficacy in action, especially in containing militancy? Indeed, Israel’s history and geography have bestowed it with extraordinary challenges that warrant its popular belligerence, but that notwithstanding, this is not the first time that it has been caught off-guard, so completely. Exactly fifty years to the day, the Arab coalition of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Iraq etc., launched a sudden, coordinated, and swift attack (Yom Kippur War) across the ceasefire line and entered the Israeli-held Sinai Peninsula and Golan Heights. That the Israeli forces counterattacked and inflicted a terrible price on joint Arab ambitions, pride, and consciousness is another matter – what was similar then, as is now, the Israelis with all their fabled intelligence depth and instinct, had failed to pick the attack miserably, as it failed now.While the familiar term that followed the ‘9/11’ fiasco, as far as the US intelligence services were concerned, had seen some ‘red flags’ but failed to ‘connect the dots’ will surely emerge in the postmortem of the Hamas attack. What is glaring is that the sheer quantum of human, material and multiple-front attacks that entailed this Hamas attack (which Israel declares their own ‘9/11’) is far more difficult to hide than the original ‘9/11’ operations. As the second biggest intelligence agency in the world with an impressive annual budget of $3 billion and with almost negligible threat perceptions from the Arab States anymore, given their constraints and evolved narrative – the Mossad ought to have had Hamas (Lebanese Hezbollah’s sabre-rattling notwithstanding) as the only realistic threat, and yet it slipped through. The consequences of the fractured and deeply polarised Israeli society in recent times, especially on the relatively moderate security agencies cannot be discounted. Many in the intelligentsia and elites of Israeli society (including senior leadership in IDF) were bitterly opposed to Netanyahu’s toying with the constitution, and with the Supreme Court, and pandering to the religious hardliners who have no understanding or background of security imperatives. A disengaged and dejected security environment couldn’t have helped matters, as Netanyahu was speeding ahead with changing the status quo of the Israeli state and sensibilities, recklessly. A couple of years back, six former security chiefs had warned against Netanyahu’s politicisation of the security apparatus to buttress his political appeal, whilst compromising on its traditional restraint and apolitical bearings.Beyond Netanyahu’s misadventures, a certain hubris and overconfidence by Israel’s intelligence agencies is obvious, perhaps a collateral damage of ‘Hollywoodising’ their image to mythic proportions. The Israeli reality is never as James Bondish as it is made out to be, as its undeniable counterattack ritual and lack of ‘political correctness’ in the face of repeated UN sanctions, does give it a larger-than-life aura, but not invincibility. History validates many spectacular failures like the 1973 Yom Kippur War, or now with the latest Hamas attack.Another lesson for other countries is the overplaying of a ‘muscular’ hand in insurgencies without an element of accompanying and necessary political-societal inputs. Israel was safer in the 90’s when the Oslo Accord was signed by the likes of Shimon Peres, but decidedly more violent when hardliners like Netanyahu or Sharon ruled. For now, Israel has no choice but to hit back hard but a more serious introspection and recalibration of governance is overdue. (The writer, a military veteran, is a former Lt Governor of Andaman & Nicobar Islands and Puducherry.

      "With India abstaining from voting on a United Nations resolution on the Israel-Hamas conflict as the resolution did not condemn Hamas’ terror acts, Opposition parties in India on Saturday asserted that the move goes against everything the country has stood for, even as the BJP stressed that India will never be on the side of terrorism.India voted in favour of an amendment proposed by Canada that asked for inserting a paragraph in the resolution that would state that the General Assembly “unequivocally rejects and condemns the terrorist attacks by Hamas that took place in Israel starting on October 7, 2023, and the taking of hostages, demands the safety, well-being and humane treatment of the hostages in compliance with international law, and calls for their immediate and unconditional release”. As the draft amendment could not be adopted, India abstained.However, India also raised concerns on the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza.Leaders of parties like the Congress, the CPI, the CPI(M), the BSP and the AIMIM said they were “shocked” and “ashamed” over India’s stand on the Jordan-drafted resolution that called for an immediate humanitarian truce in the Israel-Hamas conflict and unhindered humanitarian access in the Gaza Strip.Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar claimed there was “total confusion” in the approach of the Narendra Modi Government to the Palestine issue.However, explaining New Delhi’s decision, sources said India is concerned over the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza but at the same time strongly considers that there can be no equivocation on terror, noting the resolution did not include any explicit condemnation of the October 7 terrorist attacks by Hamas.Sources said in the absence of all elements of India’s approach not being covered in the final text of the UN Resolution, Delhi abstained in the vote on its adoption. The sources said India’s vote on the Resolution was guided by its steadfast and consistent position on the issue and India's Explanation of Vote reiterated this comprehensively and holistically. India’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Yojna Patel, in the Explanation of Vote (EOV), said, “Terrorism is a malignancy and knows no borders, nationality or race. The world should not buy into any justification of terror acts. Let us keep aside differences, unite and adopt a zero-tolerance approach to terrorism.”The EOV also strongly conveyed India’s concerns on the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza, saying, “Casualties in the ongoing conflict in Gaza are a telling, serious and continuing concern. Civilians, especially women and children are paying with their lives. This humanitarian crisis needs to be addressed. We welcome the international community's de-escalation efforts and delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza. India too has contributed to this effort.”Sources noted that India's EOV also stressed its consistent stand on Palestine.In a post on X, the Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra quoted Mahatma Gandhi’s “an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind” to criticise the Government’s stand.“I am shocked and ashamed that our country has abstained from voting for a ceasefire in Gaza,” she said.“Our country was founded on the principles of non-violence and truth, principles for which our freedom fighters laid down their lives, these principles form the basis of the constitution that defines our nationhood,” she said.They represent the moral courage of India that guided its actions as a member of the international community, she added.Reacting to Priyanka’s remarks, senior BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said those who are ashamed and shocked must realise that India will never be on the side of terrorism. “India’s Explanation of Vote spelt this out categorically. Our position on the Israel -Palestine issue is steadfast and consistent. Those who choose to side with terror do so at their own peril...,” the former Union Minority Affairs Minister said on X.“On a lighter note, Priyanka Ji, you should first educate yourself on things that are put out from your X account. Looks like people, who have no idea of Congress’ past positions on the situation, are advising you,” he said.“What is worse is that in an attempt to make you look ‘better’ than Rahul, they are making you look silly,” Naqvi added.BSP MP Danish Ali said he had never imagined that India would leave the oppressed to their fate.“I urge Prime Minister Narendra Modi to protect our special identity in the world by living up to the basic principles of humanity and play a role in saving the suffering children and drowning humanity in Gaza,” he said in a post in Hindi on X.In a post on Facebook, he alleged that the Israeli army is killing Palestinians and the world is watching it like it is an action movie.“And many stone-hearted people are rejoicing over the killing of innocent children or counting the dead bodies,” he said.“India was founded on the principles of truth and non-violence, the core principles for which our freedom fighters sacrificed their lives, these principles are the basis of the Indian Constitution that defines our nationhood and unique identity in the world.“They represent India’s moral courage that has guided its actions as a member of the international community,” he said.The CPI(M) and the CPI said that India abstaining from voting on the United Nations resolution is “shocking” and shows that Indian foreign policy is now shaped by “being a subordinate ally of US imperialism”.Communist Party of India (Marxist) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury and CPI General Secretary D Raja said in a joint statement titled ‘Stop this Genocidal Aggression in Gaza’ that India’s move negates its long-standing support to the Palestinian cause.“It is shocking that India abstained on a Resolution overwhelmingly adopted by the UN General Assembly calling for a humanitarian truce titled ‘Protection of civilians and upholding legal and humanitarian obligations’ in the ongoing Israeli offensive in Gaza,” they said.India has said terrorism is a “malignancy” and knows no borders, nationality or race and the world should not buy into any justification of terror acts, as it abstained on a resolution on the Israel-Hamas conflict.Replying to a question at a press conference, NCP leader Sharad Pawar said India never supported the way Gaza is being attacked.“Today, there is total confusion in the Indian Government’s policy. I have never seen such confusion from the Indian Government over the Palestine and Gaza issue. The first statement of the PM totally supported Israel. When there was a reaction from the outside world and India, the foreign ministry took a different line and spoke in favour of Palestine,” Pawar, a former defence minister, claimed.AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi said it is “shocking” that India abstained from voting for the UN General Assembly resolution.The resolution, which garnered 121 votes in favour, 44 abstentions and 14 member states voting against it, also demanded the immediate, continuous, sufficient and unhindered provision of essential goods and services to civilians throughout the Gaza Strip. Over 1,400 people were killed in the unprecedented attacks on Israel by Hamas on October 7. Hamas also took more than 220 people hostage. Israel then launched retaliatory strikes. The Health Ministry inHamas-ruled Gaza said on Saturday that over 7,700 Palestinians have died since October 7.\n",

      "The United Nations, its top leaders and agencies have expressed horror and strong condemnation over the killing of hundreds of civilians in a strike on a hospital in Gaza, underscoring that attack on hospitals or civilian infrastructure is against international humanitarian law and called for holding those responsible to account.The airstrike on Al-Ahili hospital on Tuesday killed at least 500 people, Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry said, blaming Israel for the attack.Israeli authorities have, however, denied involvement with the Israeli Defence Forces saying rockets misfired by Islamic Jihad militants towards Israel failed after launch and hit the hospital.“I am horrified by the killing of hundreds of Palestinian civilians in a strike on a hospital in Gaza today, which I strongly condemn. My heart is with the families of the victims. Hospitals and medical personnel are protected under international humanitarian law,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on X.In another post on X, Guterres said too many lives and the fate of the entire region hang in the balance as he called for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire” in the Middle East to ease epic human suffering.A statement issued by his spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said Guterres condemned the “strike this evening on Al-Ahli Anglican Episcopal Hospital in Gaza, with preliminary reports of hundreds killed and many others wounded, including women and children”.He emphasised that hospitals, clinics, medical personnel, and UN premises are explicitly protected under international law, the statement said.The Secretary-General also condemned the attack on a UNRWA school on Tuesday in Al-Maghazi refugee camp in Gaza which killed at least six people, the statement said.The Secretary-General extended his sincere condolences to the families of the victims and wished a swift recovery to those injured.President of the 78th session of the United Nations General Assembly Dennis Francis said he is “shocked and horrified” by the attack on Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza.“Any attack on hospitals, schools or civilian infrastructure, targeting civilians and taking them hostage, is against international humanitarian law and goes against our common humanity,” Francis said.“Collective efforts to de-escalate and to facilitate humanitarian access are urgently needed to avoid more bloodshed and civilian casualties.”UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said in a statement that hospitals are sacrosanct and must be protected at all costs.“Words fail me. Tonight, hundreds of people were killed – horrifically – in a massive strike at Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, including patients, healthcare workers and families that had been seeking refuge in and around the hospital. Once again the most vulnerable. This is totally unacceptable,” he said.The top UN Human rights official said that while the full scale of the carnage is yet not known, “what is clear is that the violence and killings must stop at once\".“All states with influence must do everything in their power to bring an end to this horrendous situation. Civilians must be protected, and humanitarian aid must be allowed to reach those in need as a matter of urgency. Those found responsible must be held to account,” Turk said.The World Health Organisation (WHO) also strongly condemned the attack on the hospital, which was operational with patients, health and caregivers, and internally displaced people sheltering there.The WHO said the hospital was one of 20 in the north of the Gaza Strip facing evacuation orders from the Israeli military.“The order for evacuation has been impossible to carry out given the current insecurity, critical condition of many patients, and lack of ambulances, staff, health system bed capacity, and alternative shelter for those displaced,” the global health agency said.The WHO called for the immediate active protection of civilians and health care. “Evacuation orders must be reversed. International humanitarian law must be abided by, which means health care must be actively protected and never targeted,” it said.The UN Population Fund (UNFPA) also strongly condemned the strike on the Al-Ahli hospital, saying attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure must cease and healthcare facilities must never be a target.In the wake of the attack, the United Arab Emirates and Russia called for an emergency UN Security Council meeting on Palestine, including the strike on the hospital.Gaza has a population of more than two million and since October 7, when the current conflict began after Hamas launched an audacious terror attack on Israel and the Jewish state declared war on the militant group, about one million Palestinians have been displaced and nearly half of them are sheltering in UNRWA schools in the Gaza Strip.Dr. Richard Peeperkorn, WHO Representative in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, said people seeking refuge from the conflict \"go to these hospitals because they expect they are safe places. Now, even a hospital is not a safe place anymore, what is?”Before the Al-Alhi Hospital deaths, Israeli strikes on Gaza killed at least 2,778 people and wounded 9,700, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.Nearly two-thirds of those killed were children, a ministry official said.Another 1,200 people across Gaza are believed to be buried under the rubble, alive or dead, health authorities said.Hamas' October 7, attack in southern Israel killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and resulted in some 200 being taken captive into Gaza. Hamas militants in Gaza have launched rockets every day since, aiming at cities across Israel.\n",

      "A massive blast rocked a Gaza City hospital packed with wounded and other Palestinians seeking shelter Tuesday, killing hundreds of people, the Hamas-run Health Ministry said. Hamas blamed an Israeli airstrike, while the Israeli military blamed a rocket misfired by other Palestinian militants.At least 500 people were killed, the ministry said.As rage spread through the region because of the hospital carnage, and with US President Joe Biden heading to the Mideast in hopes of stopping the war from spreading, Jordan's foreign minister said his country canceled a regional summit scheduled for Wednesday in Amman, where Biden was to meet with Jordan's King Abdullah II, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi.The war between Israel and Hamas was “pushing the region to the brink,” Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi told state-run television. He said Jordan would host the summit only when everyone had agreed its purpose would be to “stop the war, respect the humanity of the Palestinians and deliver the aid they deserve.”Biden will now visit only Israel, a White House official said.The explosion at the al-Ahli Hospital left gruesome scenes. Video that The Associated Press confirmed was from the hospital showed fire engulfing the building and the hospital grounds strewn with torn bodies, many of them young children. The grass around them was strewn with blankets, school backpacks and other belongings.The bloodshed unfolded as the US tried to convince Israel to allow the delivery of supplies to desperate civilians, aid groups and hospitals in the tiny Gaza Strip, which has been under a complete siege since Hamas' deadly rampage in southern Israel last week. Hundreds of thousands of increasingly desperate people were searching for bread and water.Hamas called Tuesday's hospital blast “a horrific massacre,” saying it was caused by an Israeli strike.The Israeli military blamed Islamic Jihad, a smaller, more radical Palestinian militant group that often works with Hamas. The military said Islamic Jihad militants had fired a barrage of rockets near the hospital and that “intelligence from multiple sources\" indicated the group was responsible.In a briefing with reporters, the chief army spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said the army determined there were no air force, ground or naval attacks in the area at the time of the blast. He said radar detected outgoing rocket fire at the same moment, and intercepted communications between militant groups indicated that Islamic Jihad fired the rockets.Hagari also shared aerial footage collected by a military drone that showed a blast that he said was inconsistent with Israeli weaponry. He said the explosion occurred in the building's parking lot.Since the war began, the military said in a statement that roughly 450 rockets fired at Israel by militant groups had landed in Gaza, “endangering and harming the lives of Gazan residents.”Islamic Jihad dismissed those claims, accusing Israel of “trying hard to evade responsibility for the brutal massacre it committed.”The group pointed to Israel's order that Al-Ahli be evacuated and its previous bombing of the hospital complex as proof that the hospital was an Israeli target. It also said the scale of the explosion, the angle of the bomb's fall and the extent of the destruction all pointed to Israel.Hundreds of Palestinians had taken refuge in Al-Ahli and other hospitals in Gaza City in past days, hoping they would be spared bombardment after Israel ordered all residents of the city and surrounding areas to evacuate to the southern Gaza Strip.Ambulances and private cars rushed some 350 casualties from the al-Ahli blast to Gaza City's main hospital, al-Shifa, which was already overwhelmed with wounded from other strikes, said its director, Mohammed Abu Selmia. The wounded were laid onto bloody floors, screaming in pain.“We need equipment, we need medicine, we need beds, we need anesthesia, we need everything,” Abu Selmia said. He warned that fuel for the hospital's generators would run out within hours.Before the Al-Alhi Hospital deaths, Israeli strikes on Gaza killed at least 2,778 people and wounded 9,700, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Nearly two-thirds of those killed were children, a ministry official said. Another 1,200 people across Gaza are believed to be buried under the rubble, alive or dead, health authorities said.Hamas' October 7, attack in southern Israel killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and resulted in some 200 being taken captive into Gaza. Hamas militants in Gaza have launched rockets every day since, aiming at cities across Israel.Hundreds of Palestinians flooded the streets of major West Bank cities including Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority, where protesters hurled stones at Palestinian security forces who fired back with stun grenades. Others threw stones at Israeli checkpoints, where soldiers killed one Palestinian, West Bank authorities said.Elsewhere, hundreds of people joined protests that erupted in Beirut and Amman, where an angry crowd gathered outside the Israeli Embassy.Abbas, whose Palestinian Authority exercises limited autonomy in parts of the occupied West Bank, had cancelled his participation in the summit earlier in the day to protest the hospital blast.He blamed Israel for the destruction, calling it “a massacre that cannot be tolerated or allowed to pass without accountability.”With tens of thousands of troops massed along the border, Israel has been expected to launch a ground invasion into Gaza, but its plans remained uncertain.“We are preparing for the next stages of war,” military spokesman Lt. Col. Richard Hecht said. “We haven't said what they will be. Everybody's talking about a ground offensive. It might be something different.”Throughout the day Tuesday, airstrikes killed dozens of civilians and at least one senior Hamas figure in the southern half of the Gaza Strip, where the Israeli military told fleeing Palestinians to go. An Associated Press reporter saw around 50 bodies brought to Nasser Hospital after strikes in the southern city of Khan Younis.The Israeli military said it was targeting Hamas hideouts, infrastructure and command centres.An airstrike in Deir al Balah reduced a house to rubble, killing a man and 11 women and children inside and in a neighboring house, some of whom had evacuated from Gaza City. Witnesses said there was no warning before the strike.Shelling from Israeli tanks hit a UN school in central Gaza where 4,000 Palestinians had taken refuge, killing six people and wounding dozens, the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency said. At least 24 U.N. Installations have been hit the past week, killing at least 14 members of the agency's staff.A barrage of strikes crashed into the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, levelling an entire block of homes and causing dozens of casualties, residents said. Among those killed was one of Hamas' top military commanders, Ayman Nofal, the group's military wing said — the highest-profile militant known to have been killed in the war.In Gaza City, Israeli airstrikes also hit the house of Hamas' top political official, Ismail Haniyeh, killing at least 14 people. Haniyeh is based in Doha, Qatar, but his family lives in Gaza City. The Hamas media office did not immediately identify those killed.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sought to put the blame on Hamas for Israel's retaliatory attacks and the rising civilian casualties in Gaza. “Not only is it targeting and murdering civilians with unprecedented savagery, it's hiding behind civilians,” he said.With Israel barring entry of most water, fuel and food into Gaza since Hamas' brutal attack, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken secured an agreement with Netanyahu to discuss creation of a mechanism for delivering aid to the territory's 2.3 million people. US officials said the gain might appear modest, but stressed that it was a significant step forward.Still, as of late Tuesday, there was no deal in place. A top Israeli official said his country was demanding guarantees that Hamas militants would not seize any aid deliveries. Tzahi Hanegbi, head of Israel's National Security Council, suggested entry of aid also depended on the return of hostages held by Hamas.More than 1 million Palestinians have fled their homes — roughly half of Gaza's population — and 60 per cent are now in the approximately 14-kilometre (8-mile) long area south of the evacuation zone, the UN said.At the Rafah crossing, Gaza's only connection to Egypt, truckloads of aid had been waiting to enter for more than a day. The World Food Program said that it had more than 300 tons of food waiting to cross into Gaza.\n",

      "Israel intensified its bombardments of the Gaza Strip on Monday after declaring war and vowing to destroy the “military and governing capabilities” of the enclave's Hamas rulers, as Israeli soldiers fought to secure the border and dislodge Gaza gunmen from areas of southern Israel.At least 700 people have reportedly been killed in Israel — a staggering toll on a scale the country has not experienced in decades — and more than 400 have been killed in Gaza.Palestinian militant groups claimed to be holding over 130 captives from the Israeli side.More than two days after Hamas launched its unprecedented incursion out of Gaza, Israeli forces were still battling militants holed up in several locations.As Monday began, the military said it was fighting Hamas in “seven to eight” places in southern Israel.Military spokesperson Richard Hecht said it was taking longer than expected to repel the incursion because there were still multiple breaches in the border, which Hamas could be using to bring in more fighters and weapons. “We thought this morning we'd be in a better place,” Hecht said.The Israeli Defence Forces said that 70 additional militants infiltrated Be'eri kibbutz, which the military has been unable to wrest from Hamas, overnight.Meanwhile, Israel hit more than 1,000 targets in Gaza, its military said, including airstrikes that leveled much of the town of Beit Hanoun in the enclave's northeast corner.Israeli Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told reporters Hamas was using the town as a staging ground for attacks.There was no immediate word on casualties, and most of the community's population of tens of thousands likely fled beforehand.“We will continue to attack in this way, with this force, continuously, on all gathering (places) and routes” used by Hamas, Hagari said.The declaration of war portended greater fighting ahead, and a major question was whether Israel would launch a ground assault into Gaza, a move that in the past has brought intensified casualties.An Israeli military spokesperson said that the army had called up around 100,000 reservists, and said in a statement that Israel would aim to end Hamas' rule of Gaza.“Our task is to make sure that Hamas will no longer have any military capabilities to threaten Israel with this,” said spokesperson Jonathan Conricus in a video tweeted by Israel's military.“And in addition to that, we will make sure that Hamas is no longer able to govern the Gaza Strip.”After breaking through Israeli barriers with explosives at daybreak Saturday, the Hamas gunmen rampaged for hours, gunning down civilians and snatching people in towns, along highways and at a techno music festival attended by thousands in the desert.The rescue service Zaka said it removed about 260 bodies from the festival, and that number was expected to rise. It was not clear how many of those bodies were already included in Israel's overall toll.The Israeli military estimated 1,000 Hamas fighters took part in Saturday's initial incursion.The high figure underscored the extent of planning by the militant group ruling Gaza, which has said it launched the attack in response to mounting Palestinian suffering under Israel's occupation and blockade of Gaza.Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad group claimed to have taken captive more than 130 people from inside Israel and brought them into Gaza, saying they would be traded for the release of thousands of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.The announcement, though unconfirmed, was the first sign of the scope of abductions.The captives are known to include soldiers and civilians, including women, children and older adults, mostly Israelis but also some people of other nationalities. The Israeli military said only that the number of captives is “significant.”Civilians on both sides were already paying a high price. The Israeli military was evacuating at least five towns close to Gaza, while the UN more than 123,000 Gazans were displaced by the fighting.Mayyan Zin, a divorced mother of two, said she learned that her two daughters had been abducted when a relative sent her photos from a Telegram group showing them sitting on mattresses in captivity.She then found online videos of a chilling scene in her ex-husband's home in the town of Nahal Oz: Gunmen who had broken in speak to him, his leg bleeding, in the living room near the two terrified, weeping daughters, Dafna, 15, and Ella, 8.Another video showed the father being taken across the border into Gaza.“Just bring my daughters home and to their family. All the people,” Zin said.In Gaza, a tiny enclave of 2.3 million people sealed off by an Israeli-Egyptian blockade for 16 years since the Hamas takeover, residents feared further escalation.As of late Sunday, Israeli airstrikes had destroyed 159 housing units across Gaza and severely damaged 1,210 others, the UN said.The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said a school sheltering more than 225 people took a direct hit. It did not say where the fire came from.In the Palestinian city of Rafah in southern Gaza, an Israeli airstrike early Monday killed 19 people, including women and children, said Talat Barhoum, a doctor at the local Al-Najjar Hospital.Barhoum said aircraft hit the home of the Abu Hilal family, and that one of those killed was Rafaat Abu Hilal, a leader of a local armed group. The strike caused damage to surrounding homes.Over the weekend, another airstrike on a home in Rafah killed 19 members of the Abu Outa family, including women and children, when they were huddling on the ground floor in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, survivors said.Several Israeli media outlets, citing rescue service officials, said at least 700 people have been killed in Israel, including 44 soldiers.The Gaza Health Ministry said 413 people, including 78 children and 41 women, were killed in the territory. Some 2,000 people have been wounded on each side. An Israeli official said security forces have killed 400 militants and captured dozens more.Over the weekend, the Israeli Security Cabinet declared war and approved “significant military steps” in response to the Hamas attack.The steps were not defined, but the declaration appears to give the military and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a wide mandate.In a statement, Netanyahu's office said the aim will be the destruction of Hamas' “military and governing capabilities” to an extent that prevents it from threatening Israelis “for many years.”The declaration of war was largely symbolic, said Yohanan Plesner, the head of the Israel Democracy Institute, a think tank, but it “demonstrates that the government thinks we are entering a more lengthy, intense and significant period of war.”Israel has carried out major military campaigns over the past four decades in Lebanon and Gaza that it portrayed as wars, but without a formal declaration.The presence of hostages in Gaza complicates Israel's response. Israel has a history of making heavily lopsided exchanges to bring captive Israelis home.An Egyptian official said Israel sought help from Cairo to ensure the safety of the hostages.Egypt also spoke with both sides about a potential cease-fire, but Israel was not open to a truce “at this stage,” according to the official, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorised to brief media.In northern Israel, a brief exchange of strikes with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group fanned fears that the fighting could expand into a wider regional war.Hezbollah fired rockets and shells Sunday at Israeli positions in a disputed area along the border, and Israel fired back using armed drones. The Israeli military said the situation was calm after the exchange.Elsewhere, six Palestinians were killed in clashes with Israeli soldiers Sunday around the West Bank.Over the past year, Israel's far-right government has ramped up settlement construction in the occupied West Bank.Israeli settler violence has displaced hundreds of Palestinians there, and tensions have flared around the Al-Aqsa mosque, a flashpoint Jerusalem holy site.\n",

      "Israel's defence minister has ordered a “complete siege” on the Gaza Strip following an unprecedented incursion into Israel by Hamas fighters.Israel formally declared war on Sunday and gave the green light for “significant military steps” to retaliate against Hamas for Saturday's surprise attack.More than 1,100 people have been killed and thousands wounded on both sides.The defence minister's announcement on Monday came as Israel's military scoured the country's south for Hamas fighters and guarded breaches in its border fence with tanks while pounding Gaza from the air.A spokesperson said the Israeli military regained control of border communities taken by Hamas fighters during the attack. But Palestinian militants continued firing barrages of rockets, setting off air raid sirens in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.REPORT: EGYPT SEEKS ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN PRISONER TRADEEgypt has engaged in negotiations with Israel and Palestinian militant groups to release Palestinian women in Israel's prisons in exchange for Israeli women captured by Hamas militants, the state-owned Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram reported Monday.The daily paper quoted an unnamed source as saying that the negotiations were aimed at finalising an agreement on the trade.“The Egyptian government is presently awaiting responses from both parties regarding the proposed prisoners exchange and a temporary cease-fire,” Al-Ahram said.Palestinian militant groups have claimed to be holding over 130 people who were captured in Israel in the past two days.Hamas spokesman Abdel-Latif al-Qanoua told The Associated Press by phone that the group's fighters had captured more Israelis as recently as Monday morning.He said the group aims to free all Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, which in the past has agreed to lopsided exchanges.LEBANON URGES INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO PRESSURE ISRAELLebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said Monday that the tiny country's priority is to maintain stability along its southern border with Israel following an exchange of attacks between Israeli troops and Hezbollah militants over the weekend.Hezbollah claimed responsibility for firing rockets at three Israeli positions in a disputed territory along the border of the Israeli-occupied Syrian Golan Heights, before Israel returned fire.Mikati called on the international community to “take responsibility” in pressuring Israel to return to peace talks under the Arab Peace Initiative.“Anything other than that is a further spiraling of violence that will not benefit anyone,” he said.Iran-backed Hezbollah has praised key ally Hamas for its unprecedented incursion into Israel but not said if it would attempt to join forces.Israel has estimated that Hezbollah has some 150,000 rockets and missiles aimed at the country.EUROPEAN NATIONS REPATRIATE CITIZENS WITH FLIGHTS FROM ISRAELGovernments and airlines in Europe are conducting emergency and regular flights from Israel to bring back European citizens who were in the country when Hamas fighters attacked.Romania's Ministry of Foreign Affairs says nearly 600 Romanian citizens, including two groups of pilgrims, were repatriated from Israel on commercial flights over the weekend.A Bulgarian government aircraft has been sent to Tel Aviv to evacuate Bulgarian citizens stranded in Israel.

And the continuation of such a spiral of violence, of course, is fraught with further escalation and expansion of this conflict. This is a great danger for the region, so we are extremely concerned,” Peskov said.The Kremlin spokesman added that Russian authorities were not aware of any Russian nationals injured in the conflict.EUROPEAN UNION CONVENES EMERGENCY MEETINGThe European Union is convening an emergency meeting of its foreign ministers to assess the developing violence in Israel, while stressing that the nation had every right to defend itself against the unprecedented incursion by Hamas fighters.The ministers will organise the Tuesday meeting in Oman, where EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell and some EU delegations are attending an EU-Gulf Cooperation Council joint meeting.Others will join by video conference.“The priority right now is for the aggression by Hamas to stop. The hostages need to be released and we need to see the overall deescalation of the situation,” EU spokesman Peter Stano said.\n",

      "iPhone-maker Apple Inc on Tuesday said it does not attribute threat notifications, such as the ones received by some MPs belonging to Opposition parties, to any specific state-sponsored attackers and that it cannot provide information on what causes such warnings.After some of the most vocal critics of the government said they received warnings that attempts have been made by state-sponsored attackers to steal information from their iPhones, Apple in a statement stated it is possible that some threat notifications may be false alarms and some attacks may not be detected.\"Apple does not attribute the threat notifications to any specific state-sponsored attacker,\" the firm said.State-sponsored attackers, it said, are \"very well-funded and sophisticated, and their attacks evolve over time\".\"Detecting such attacks relies on threat intelligence signals that are often imperfect and incomplete. It's possible that some Apple threat notifications may be false alarms, or that some attacks are not detected,\" it said.It, however, refused to say what triggered warnings received by MPs, such as Mahua Moitra of TMC.\"We are unable to provide information about what causes us to issue threat notifications, as that may help state-sponsored attackers adapt their behaviour to evade detection in the future,\" Apple said.Meanwhile, sources privy to the development said Apple has sent threat notifications to individuals whose accounts are in nearly 150 countries.Several opposition leaders on Tuesday claimed they had received an alert from Apple warning them of \"state-sponsored attackers trying to remotely compromise\" their iPhones and posted purported screenshots of the message on their X handles.Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi, Trinamool Congress' Mahua Moitra, Aam Aadmi Party's Raghav Chadha, Congress' Shashi Tharoor and his party's media and publicity department head Pawan Khera shared the message from Apple on X.

      "Matthew Perry's family has expressed gratitude to fans and well-wishers for remembering the \"Friends\" star, who died at his home here over the weekend .Perry passed away on Saturday at his Pacific Palisades residence. He was found unresponsive in his hot tub and was believed to have drowned. No official cause or contributing factors to his death have been established yet.“We are heartbroken by the tragic loss of our beloved son and brother. Matthew brought so much joy to the world, both as an actor and a friend. You all meant so much to him and we appreciate the tremendous outpouring of love,\" Perry's family told TMZ.According to the publication , the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner will prepare an official report on the 54-year-old actor's death.Perry shot to international fame with popular sitcom `Friends\" for his portrayal of the socially awkward but amiable Chandler Bing who used sarcasm to get by in life.“Friends” co-creators Marta Kauffman and David Crane, along with the show's executive producer Kevin Bright, released a joint statement expressing their shock over the sudden demise of the actor.“We are shocked and deeply, deeply saddened by our beloved friend Matthew's passing. It still seems impossible. All we can say is that we feel blessed to have had him as part of our lives,\" the trio said in a statement to The Times.They praised Perry's comedic acting abilities, highlighted throughout the show's 10-year run.“He was a brilliant talent. It's a cliche to say that an actor makes a role their own, but in Matthew's case, there are no truer words. From the day we first heard him embody the role of Chandler Bing, there was no one else for us,” they wrote.“We will always cherish the joy, the light, the blinding intelligence he brought to every moment — not just to his work, but in life as well. He was always the funniest person in the room. More than that, he was the sweetest, with a giving and selfless heart.”Besides his work on \"Friends\", Perry's credits include films such as \"Fools Rush In\" and \"The Whole Nine Yards\". In 2015, he played Oscar for a CBS reboot of \"The Odd Couple\" that aired for two seasons.In 2021, the actor appeared on HBO Max's \"Friends\" reunion special along with Aniston, Cox, Kudrow, Schwimmer, and LeBlanc.\n",

      "With an Israeli ground offensive in Gaza looming large, Israel has said it will step up its aerial strikes in the besieged Palestinian territory to create the “best conditions” for troops to move in.Indicating Israel's preparations for the second stage of its declared three-phase operation to change the security regime in Gaza, Israel Defence Forces (IDF) spokesperson Daniel Hagari said, “We have to enter the next phase of the war in the best conditions, not according to what anyone tells us.” “From today, we are increasing the strikes and minimizing the danger,” Hagari told reporters on Saturday, in a clear signal towards an imminent ground incursion.In another clear indicator that Israel was preparing for the second stage of its three-phase operation to change the “security regime” in Gaza, IDF’s Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi told commanders of the elite Golani infantry brigade earlier on Saturday that they should expect surprises prepared by terror groups when they enter the Gaza Strip.“We will enter the Gaza Strip. We will begin an operational and professional mission to destroy the Hamas operatives, the Hamas infrastructure, and we will also keep in our minds the images, the scenes and the fallen from Shabbat (Saturday) two weeks ago,” Halevi told the commanders.He was referring to the latest conflict, triggered by the unprecedented attacks against Israel by Hamas militants on October 7, which killed around 1,400 people. Israel has launched a massive counter-offensive against the Islamic militant group that has ruled Gaza since 2007.“Gaza is complex, Gaza is dense, the enemy is preparing a lot of things there, but we are preparing things for them as well,” the IDF chief said.Earlier this week, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant laid out Israel's plan to change the “security regime\" in Gaza-- implying Hamas' removal-- and said the plan was designed in three stages.The IDF was currently in the first stage of the plan when it was carrying out aerial strikes. It will be followed by ground incursion and finally, the change of security regime in Gaza, Gallant said.Israel has amassed hundreds of thousands of troops in preparations for the ground offensive.More than 1,400 people were killed in Israel in the deadly terror attack carried out by the Palestinian militant group in the south of the Jewish state, and at least 210 were taken captive, a number that is likely to go further up as per official estimates.Around 4,385 Palestinians are said to have been killed in Gaza in the Israeli offensive that followed. \n",

      "Israel makes no bones about its intention of flattening Gaza and massacring its civiliansIt’s becoming clearer by the day that the war declared by Israel on Gaza is meant to be against the civilians rather than Hamas. The number of bombs dropped on the people so far is proof of its intention of wiping off Palestinians from Gaza. All these attacks are in the name of defeating Hamas and are actually all about removing any sort of resistance to Israel’s occupation. It is a continuation of Israel’s policy of confiscating land without care for the people. Thus, it is yet another attempt to make Israel, ‘a Jews only’ state. This war is nothing, but a continuation of the same policy practised by the Israelis against the Palestinians for decades. Targeting civilians is a crime against humanity, yet it has been a core part of Israel's actions. In fact, during the first Nakba (catastrophe) in 1948, thousands of Palestinians were killed, countless villages were burned, and women were raped and tortured. The survivors brought with them the horror stories that they had to endure at the hands of Israeli militants. They were spared on purpose to instil fear among other Palestinians to desist from defying the dictates of Israel. A large Palestinian population was expelled and lives as refugees in neighbouring countries.The people of Gaza are a mix of refugees, who fled from other parts of Palestine, who have survived the onslaught of the Armed Jews Group and who have been living under deprived conditions with the natives for the last 56 years. Gaza’s residents have been living in an ‘open prison’ since 1967 even though Israel has claimed to have withdrawn from the Gaza Strip in 2007. In fact, the entirety of Gaza is besieged from land, air, and sea by Israeli occupational forces to this present day. Making no bones about his intentions, the National security minister of Israel, Itamar Ben Gvir, stated: “The only thing that needs to enter Gaza are hundreds of tonnes of explosives from the Air Force, not an ounce of humanitarian aid.”The rocket attack on the Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City killing hundreds of Palestinians is a case in point. Israel is clearly moving ahead with its plan to vacate Gaza by instilling fear among the residents who are already at their wit's end; deprived of food, water, electricity and medical aid they have nowhere to go, just waiting for the inevitable.Thus, we are witnessing a genocide unfolding in real time. This policy will fail and it will not make Israel safer nor bring peace to the region but the Palestinians would have to pay a heavy price for no fault of theirs. The highest number of fatalities in this massacre have been women and children. You do not have to watch the news and stare at the television to see dead bodies scattered all over the place. Hospitals, colleges, schools, markets, convoys, nothing is safe from the bombs that are being dropped, in fact, it is as clear as day, to see that they are purposefully being targeted. The latest weaponry is being used and tested on Palestinians and will be ready for sale; the massacre of Palestinians would be proof of the quality and help Israel’s arms industry.As Guru Nanak Ji once said, “We are all human before we belong to any religion,” You do not need to be a Muslim to condemn and call for an end to this carnage. Let us be brave and human enough to condemn this massacre and trampling of human rights. Though the US has now shown some sensitivity towards the people of Gaza and brokered a deal with Israel and Egypt to deliver medical aid along with other necessary supplies, it is too little too late. Nevertheless, the US has done the right thing and the world must follow. The world community should come forward and condemn Israel in one voice else we would be witnessing the biggest crime against humanity.(The writer is a South Asia-based senior foreign journalist and an expert on West Asia; views expressed are personal))\n",

      "As she accepted an endorsement from a group called Veterans for Trump, Stacy Skinner spoke about how she got into politics because Democrats “were starting to infiltrate on the local level”.Former President Donald Trump and other national Republicans often warn of takeovers by China or people crossing the US-Mexico border. Skinner is running for reelection to the City Council of Johns Creek, an Atlanta suburb of about 85,000.Yet the 44-year-old does not openly promote her Trump association, telling inquisitive voters in this Republican-leaning enclave only that she is “conservative”. Skinner's opponent, Devon Dabney, meanwhile, faces questions about being a Democrat.Going into the 2024 presidential election, the dynamics in Johns Creek and other nearby Atlanta suburbs reflect how partisan and cultural divisions that intensified since Trump's 2016 run have trickled down to local campaigns.Some activists and voters now view these nominally nonpartisan contests as critical fronts in shaping the nation's identity.“People have a right to know who they're voting for,” said Betsy Kramer, a Republican Party volunteer who is backing Skinner in Johns Creek, which is about 30 miles north of downtown Atlanta in Fulton County.“I'm not voting for a Democrat,” Kramer said. “I'm concerned that if Democrats start taking over north Fulton, the whole area is going to change dramatically.”The suburbs of Georgia's largest city once anchored the state's Republican establishment. Today, they play a prime role in determining the outcomes of statewide races. In 2020, they were pivotal in Democrat Joe Biden's close victory over Trump, the Republican incumbent, in the president election.This swath of the metro area has become more demographically and politically diverse over recent decades, with growth among Asian American, Black and Hispanic populations that help boost Democrats' vote totals.The share of Georgia residents who identify as white and non-Hispanic fell in the most recent census to 50.1 per cent, the lowest on record.Additionally, some Republicans who still make up north Fulton County's electoral majority have never marched in lockstep with Trump and the tea party, a movement that opposes the Washington political establishment and espouses conservative and libertarian philosophy.In 2020, Trump underperformed historical Republican advantages in the area on his way to losing Georgia by fewer than 12,000 votes out of 5 million cast. And the region once elected Brad Raffensperger, Georgia's secretary of state who bucked Trump's efforts to overturn his defeat, to the state Senate.Raffensperger and Gov. Brian Kemp drew strong support here in their comfortable reelection victories last year despite furious criticism from Trump for not going along with his bid to overturn the election. Trump's efforts are now the focus of a racketeering indictment in Fulton County.The national undercurrents do not mean that the usual list of hot topics at city halls has changed. It's still mostly zoning and other development rules; sales tax and property millage rates; and how best to deliver services like public safety, fire protection and garbage collection. But candidates and voters talk about old, familiar debates in a different way as partisan influences rise.“We are seeing this nationalization everywhere, especially in school board elections but also extending to cities,” said Michigan State University professor Sarah Reckhow, who tracks American campaign trends.Reckhow pointed to several variables: the gutting of local journalism that means voters hear mostly about national politics; voter demands revolving more around cultural hot buttons rather than traditional local policy; and low voter turnout that increases the power of the most engaged and partisan citizens.“This creates a cycle,” she said, where voter preferences, media narratives and politicians' rhetoric become “kind of reinforcing”.The new landscape may help explain why Skinner is circumspect about Trump and how she and Dabney are carefully navigating their partisan preferences.“President Trump is obviously divisive,” said Skinner in a interview, insisting the endorsement “was about the veterans” rather than Trump himself. “Everything has gotten more divisive than I think it needs to be.”Dabney, a Black woman, nonetheless sees herself as a target. She bemoans what she says is a “whisper campaign” that casts her as a threat to Johns Creek's identity because of her voting history.She acknowledged getting door-knocking and other help from grassroots progressive groups in Johns Creek and Democratic activists from elsewhere but said that came only after she was being attacked by Republicans.“My parents were involved in the Civil Rights Movement,\" she said. \"It's no secret that most Black people have voted for Democrats since then.”But “this is a nonpartisan election”, she said. “It shouldn't matter.”The new intensity is especially obvious in discussions over development, conversations that usually revolve around “high-density” construction of apartments and condominiums.Zoning has long been contentious in US suburbs, which blossomed after World War II and through the Civil Rights Movement as places for middle-class and upper middle-class whites to establish self-contained communities set between the economic challenges of rural America and the racial and ethnic diversity of large cities, including Atlanta.Now, those zoning issues are a flashpoint in partisan politics. They are reflected in national rhetoric like Trump's call to build a wall on the US-Mexico border, arguments over “sanctuary cities” run by liberals and tighter federal restrictions on legal immigration.“I don't want our city to become a hellhole. I don't want to become Atlanta,” said Kramer, the Johns Creek Republican. She associated Georgia's capital city with “crime” and “riffraff”, similar to how Trump once disparaged Atlanta as “crime infested” and “falling apart”.Atlanta's population is 48 per cent Black and 41 per cent white. Johns Creek is about 52 per cent non-Hispanic white. Asians make up about one-quarter of the population and Black residents about one-tenth, according to the US Census Bureau.“Some of them are my very good friends,” Kramer said of Johns Creek's many nonwhite residents. But the white Boston-area native, who moved to Georgia decades ago, argued that putting more Democrats in local office guarantees housing policy that would “change the demographics”.“I want anybody that can come afford it to live in our city,” she said. “We live in a high-rent district, and I want to keep it that way. I'm not trying to keep anybody out.”In nearby Roswell, City Council candidate Jason Miller said the “high-density” debate has yielded a perceived battle between “two slates”.Miller, who moved to Roswell from Atlanta with his husband, is among the candidates who does not want to give developers free rein on residential high-density projects. He wants to focus on business development first.“I want us to be intentional ... So we give more Roswell residents the opportunity to work closer to home rather than be a bedroom community that feeds Atlanta and other suburbs,” he said. “I'm all about growing density, as long as we do it wisely.”Others running in Roswell, though, talk about development in the context of partisan control.“The other side is about bringing in new voters,” candidate Allen Sells, a self-described conservative, said at a recent event for several council hopefuls. “That's what they're all about.”Miller, describing himself as a left-leaning independent, said the atmosphere leaves him miscast, with some voters associating him with “far-right thinking people” and some conservatives thinking he is a “socialist”.He characterised his voting history as “mostly Democratic but plenty of Republicans” but said some voters want to know his specific candidate choices and demand his take on issues that rarely, if ever, come before city government.“I've gotten emails and questions from voters asking me about my position on abortion,” he said. “It's bizarre,” Miller lamented, how the partisan mindset “filters all the way down to local elections”.Indeed, at the gathering where Miller and Sells spoke, the biggest cheer of the evening came during introductions of other local elected officials. The crowd roared at the mention of Fulton County Commissioner Bridget Thorne, an outspoken conservative who won her seat after pushing the lie that widespread voter fraud marred Georgia's 2020 elections.In Johns Creek, at the only event where Dabney and Skinner have shared the same stage, they staked out essentially the same approach to development, saying they would adhere to the city's existing master plan. Skinner called it “responsible development” that allows residential and business growth. Dabney lamented later that her actual positions on issues have taken a back seat.“I was always well-liked in the community,” she said. But once she launched her campaign, “then it's, Well, she's this Democrat. She's going to bring density and affordable housing.\n",

      "The Israeli military said it killed four militants wearing explosive vests attempting to cross into the country from Lebanon, its Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee said.A video from a reconnaissance drone the Israeli army shared showed the militants near the separation wall before they were targeted, causing an explosion.No group in Lebanon claimed immediately claimed responsibility. Last week, militants from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad in southern Lebanon crossed the border and clashed with Israeli troops, killing 3 and wounding several others. The militants were killed, and the Palestinian group held funerals for two of them.Tensions have flared along the Lebanon-Israel border between the Hezbollah group and Israeli military. While shelling has been limited to towns along the border, there are fears Hezbollah and other Iran-backed groups would escalate their actions to support Hamas should Israel begin a ground operation in Gaza.Malaysia's Anwar Warns Gaza Crisis Could Turn Into GenocideKuala Lumpur: Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim says the crisis in Gaza could turn into genocide if Israel's war against Hamas in the territory continues.Anwar said Tuesday that civilian safety must be given top priority. He said he expressed Malaysia's unwavering support for the Palestinian people during a phone conversation Monday with Hamas political bureau chief, Ismail Haniyeh.“Given the dire situation in Gaza, I strongly advocate for the immediate cessation of bombardment and the establishment of a humanitarian corridor in Rafah,” he wrote on social media. He urged Israel to “genuinely pursue a peaceful resolution” to end the conflict.Anwar told Parliament on Monday that Malaysia rebuffed calls by Western countries to condemn Hamas for its Oct 7 incursion into Israel that set off their latest war. Malaysia blames years of injustice and Israeli oppression on the Palestinian people for the Hamas incursion.“If no action is taken, it will turn into a genocide war,” he said. “If the world is unable to do anything, it means that the world is allowing the mass killing of Palestinians.”Malaysia, a moderate, mostly Muslim nation, has long been a critic of Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories. It does not have diplomatic ties with Israel.Anwar plans to attend a meeting of Gulf leaders in Saudi Arabia this week and has said he would discuss the issue with his counterparts.Malaysia has allocated $2.1 million to the UN relief agency helping Palestinian refugees and hopes to raise up to $22 million for Palestinian humanitarian aid.Palestinians Report Heavy Shelling In Southern GazaGaza Strip: Palestinians in Gaza reported intense bombardments early Tuesday near the southern towns of Khan Younis and Rafah, where Israel ordered civilians to seek refuge.Israeli bombs hit areas west and southeast of Khan Younis and west of Rafah, according to local reports.

      "The Israel’s Gaza campaign can upset many bilateral agreementsTwo world leaders in the middle of almost every geo-political discussion for the past year, travelled out to their respective countries, to resolve the unfolding Israel war on terror. US President, Joe Biden travelled to Israel to express solidarity with one of its closest allies in West Asia. His next stop was Jordan where according to the white house statement, the president’s trip “reiterated that Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian people’s right to dignity and self-determination and discuss the humanitarian needs of civilians in Gaza. “The President also met with leaders from Egypt, and Palestinian Authority in Amman during the trip. A careful balancing of risks involved with the President’s trip to Israel played out in the background, with several senior officials in the White House admitting about the possible PR fallout of the high-level visit. The fear of a ground attack on Gaza, with US marines in the vicinity, or joining in, causing huge casualties of Palestinians, could trigger a backlash against the war against terror globally. The collective memory of people around the world is currently bombarded with visuals of human tragedy and piles of rubble, caused first by the war in Ukraine for the past year, followed by the Gaza strip, even though, many of them would have preferred, some more time to come out Covid induced economic misfortunes. Additionally, President Biden faces a tough re-election next year, with political sentiments in the US on a slippery ground regarding the state/number of wars America can afford. The world, particularly US citizens, may have a war fatigue, with the one in Ukraine, directly aided by billions of dollars, refusing to die down even in the second year.At this juncture, for President Biden, to be drawn into a full-fledged “war against terror group Hamas” in West Asia with its ally Israel, could suitably upset domestic political equations. The US has gradually pulled out from West Asia, in the past decade, leaving it up to local sovereign players to come to terms with each other’s sensitivities. The ongoing war on terror as a response to the dastardly act, caused by US recognised terror group Hamas, could pull it back to the region upsetting its existing bilateral relations with several other countries present in the vicinity. To be sure, the US led the Arab world and Israel to slowly start patching up through the Abrahm’s Accord, which involved a bunch of bilateral agreements between the countries persuaded by Washington DC to work towards a common good. The US also stitched together the I2U2 framework, which brought India, Israel and UAE to work closely on global and regional issues of concern. The current conflict in West Asia could upset some of these equations.Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin landed in Beijing, his second international trip since the International Criminal Court (ICC)issued an arrest warrant on him earlier this year. This trip was widely followed, as it marked the reiteration of “no limits” friendship, between Russia and China which are trying to lead a world order without the US and its allies. President Putin travelled to Beijing, immediately before he attacked Ukraine last year. Meanwhile, despite the arrest warrant, issued by ICC, President Xi landed in Moscow on a state visit and showered praises on the Russian premiere. President Putin’s trip to Beijing this week was more to support the Belt and Road Initiative which he had termed as one meant for international cooperation earlier.India meanwhile has to play a tight diplomatic walk with its full-fledged support to Israel for its war against terror along with the US. India has not ruptured its relations with Russia, while it continues to have abnormal relations with China due to the military conflict and is opposed to the Belt and Road Initiative, as it runs through India's acknowledged disputed territories. India is on a wait-and-watch, which it has done in the past on the Ukraine war, the Israel conflict may be no exception.(The writer is a policy analyst; views expressed are personal)\n",

      "Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for a visit that underscores China's support for Moscow during its war in Ukraine as well as Russian backing for China's bid to expand its economic and diplomatic influence abroad.The two countries have forged an informal alliance against the United States and other democratic nations that is now complicated by the Israel-Hamas war. China has sought to balance its ties with Israel against its relations with Iran and Syria, two countries that are strongly backed by Russia and with which China has forged ties for economic reasons as well as to challenge Washington's influence in the Middle East.Putin's plane was met by an honour guard as the Russian leader began his visit that is also a show of support for Chinese leader Xi Jinping's signature ‘Belt and Road' initiative to build infrastructure and expand China's overseas influence.In an interview to Chinese state media, Putin praised the massive but loosely linked BRI projects.“Yes, we see that some people consider it an attempt by the People's Republic of China to put someone under its thumb, but we see otherwise, we just see desire for cooperation,” he told state broadcaster CCTV, according to a transcript released by the Kremlin on Monday.Putin will be among the highest profile guests at a gathering marking the 10th anniversary of Xi's announcement of the BRI project, which has laden countries such as Zambia and Sri Lanka with heavy debt from contracts with Chinese companies to build roads, airports and other public works they could not otherwise afford. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has praised the Chinese policy as bringing development to neglected areas.Asked by reporters Friday about his visit, Putin said it would encompass talks on Belt and Road-related projects, which he said Moscow wants to link with efforts by an economic alliance of former Soviet Union nations mostly located in Central Asia to “achieve common development goals.”He also downplayed the impact of China's economic influence in a region that Russia has long considered its backyard and where it has worked to maintain political and military clout.“We don't have any contradictions here, on the contrary, there is a certain synergy,” Putin said.Putin said he and Xi would also discuss growing economic ties between Moscow and Beijing in energy, high-tech and financial industries. China has also grown in importance as an export destination for Russia.Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Centre, said that from China's view, “Russia is a safe neighbour that is friendly, that is a source of cheap raw materials, that's a support for Chinese initiatives on the global stage and that's also a source of military technologies, some of those that China doesn't have.”“For Russia, China is its lifeline, economic lifeline in its brutal repression against Ukraine,” Gabuev told The Associated Press.“It's the major market for Russian commodities, it's a country that provides its currency and payment system to settle Russia's trade with the outside world — with China itself, but also with many other countries, and is also the major source of sophisticated technological imports, including dual-use goods that go into the Russian military machine.”Gabuev said that while Moscow and Beijing will be unlikely to forge a full-fledged military alliance, their defence cooperation will grow.“Both countries are self-sufficient in terms of security and they benefit from partnering, but neither really requires a security guarantee from the other. And they preach strategic autonomy,” he said.“There will be no military alliance, but there will be closer military cooperation, more interoperability, more cooperation on projecting force together, including in places like the Arctic and more joint effort to develop a missile defence that makes the U.S. Nuclear planning and planning of the U.S. And its allies in Asia and in Europe more complicated,” he added.The Chinese and Soviets were Cold War rivals for influence among left-leaning states, but China and Russia have since partnered in the economic, military and diplomatic spheres.Just weeks before Russia's invasion of Ukraine last February, Putin met with Xi in Beijing and the sides signed an agreement pledging a “no-limits” relationship. Beijing's attempts to present itself as a neutral peace broker in Russia's war on Ukraine have been widely dismissed by the international community.Xi visited Moscow in March as part of a flurry of exchanges between the countries. China has condemned international sanctions imposed on Russia, but hasn't directly addressed an arrest warrant issued for Putin by the International Criminal Court on charges of alleged involvement in the abductions of thousands of children from Ukraine.\n",

      "The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees told a UN emergency meeting Monday “an immediate humanitarian ceasefire has become a matter of life and death for millions,” accusing Israel of “collective punishment” of Palestinians and the forced displacement of civilians.Philippe Lazzarini warned that a further breakdown of civil order following the looting of the agency's warehouses by Palestinians searching for food and other aid “will make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the largest UN agency in Gaza to continue operating.”Briefings to the Security Council by Lazzarini, the head of the UN children's agency UNICEF and a senior UN humanitarian official painted a dire picture of the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza 23 days after Hamas' surprise Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, and its ongoing retaliatory military action aimed at “obliterating” the militant group, which controls Gaza.According to the latest figures from Gaza's Ministry of Health, more than 8,300 people have been killed – 66 per cent of them women and children – and tens of thousands injured, the UN humanitarian office said.UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell that toll includes over 3,400 children killed and more than 6,300 injured. “This means that more than 420 children are being killed or injured in Gaza each day – a number which should shake each of us to our core,” she said.Lazzarini said:. “This surpasses the number of children killed annually across the world's conflict zones since 2019.” And he stressed: “This cannot be `collateral damage.'”Many speakers at the council meeting denounced Hamas' October 7 surprise attacks on Israel that killed over 1,400 people, and urged the release of some 230 hostages taken to Gaza by the militants. But virtually every speaker also stressed that Israel is obligated under international humanitarian law to protect civilians and their essentials for life including hospitals, schools and other infrastructure – and Israel was criticized for cutting off food, water, fuel and medicine to Gaza and cutting communications for several days.Lazzarini said “the handful of convoys” allowed into Gaza through the Rafah crossing from Egypt in recent days “is nothing compared to the needs of over 2 million people trapped in Gaza.”“The system in place to allow aid into Gaza is geared to fail,\" he said, \"unless there is political will to make the flow of supplies meaningful, matching the unprecedented humanitarian needs.”The commissioner-general of the UN agency known as UNRWA said there is no safe place anywhere in Gaza, warning that basic services are crumbling, medicine, food, water and fuel are running out, and the streets “have started overflowing with sewage, which will cause a massive health hazard very soon.”UNICEF oversees water and sanitation issues for the UN, and Russell warned that “the lack of clean water and safe sanitation is on the verge of becoming a catastrophe.”US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield urged the divided Security Council – which has rejected four resolutions that would have responded to the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks and the ongoing war – to come together, saying “the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is growing more dire by the day.”Stressing that all innocent civilians must be protected, she said the council must call “for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, address the immense humanitarian needs of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, affirm Israel's right to defend itself from terrorism, and remind all actors that international humanitarian law must be respected.” She reiterated President Joe Biden's call for humanitarian pauses to get hostages out, allow aid in, and safe passage for civilians.“That means Hamas must not use Palestinians as human shields – an act of unthinkable cruelty and a violation of the law of war,” the US ambassador said, “and that means Israel must take all possible precautions to avoid harm to civilians.”In a sign of increasing US concern at the escalating Palestinian death toll, Thomas-Greenfield told the council Biden reiterated to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday “that while Israel has the right and responsibility to defend its citizens from terrorism, it must do so in a manner consistent with international humanitarian law.”“The fact that Hamas operates within and under the cover of civilians areas creates an added burden for Israel, but it does not lessen its responsibility to distinguish between terrorists and innocent civilians,” she stressed.Following the rejection of the four resolutions in the 15-member Security Council – one vetoed by the US, one vetoed by Russia and China, and two for failing to get the minimum nine “yes” votes – Arab nations went to the UN General Assembly last Friday where there are no vetoes.The 193-member world body adopted a resolution calling for humanitarian truces leading to a cessation of hostilities by a vote of 120-14 with 45 abstentions. Now, the 10 elected members in the 15-member Security Council are trying again to negotiate a resolution that won't be rejected. While council resolutions are legally binding, assembly resolutions are not though they are an important barometer of world opinion.\n",

      "US President Joe Biden has said that he is convinced that one of the reasons why Hamas launched a terrorist attack on Israel was because of the recent announcement during the G-20 Summit in New Delhi on the ambitious India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor that integrates the entire region with a network of railroad.Israel has launched a massive counter-offensive against Hamas after unprecedented attacks by the militant group on October 7 killed more than 1,400 people.Biden told reporters at a joint news conference with the visiting Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese that his analysis is based on his instinct and does not have any proof for this.“I'm convinced one of the reasons Hamas attacked when they did, and I have no proof of this, just my instinct tells me, is because of the progress we were making towards regional integration for Israel, and regional integration overall. We can't leave that work behind,” Biden said.This is the second time in less than a week that Biden has mentioned the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEEC) as a potential reason for the terrorist attack by Hamas.The new economic corridor, which many see as an alternative to China's Belt and Road Initiative, was jointly announced by the leaders of the US, India, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, France, Germany, Italy and the European Union on the sidelines of the G20 summit in September.The corridor comprises an eastern corridor connecting India to the Gulf region and a northern corridor connecting the Gulf region to Europe.Biden said in the past few weeks, he has spoken to leaders throughout the region, including King Abdullah of Jordan, President Sisi of Egypt, President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, and Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia about making sure there's real hope in the region for a better future about the need to work toward a greater integration for Israel while insisting that the aspirations of the Palestinian people will be part, will be part of that future as well.\n",

      "The leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah group held talks on Wednesday with senior Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad figures in a key meeting of three top anti-Israel militant groups amid the war raging in Gaza.A brief statement following the meeting said that Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah agreed with Hamas' Saleh al-Arouri and Islamic Jihad's leader Ziad al-Nakhleh on the next steps that the three — along with other Iran-backed militants — should take at this “sensitive stage.\"Their goal, according to the statement that was carried on Hezbollah-run and Lebanese state media, was to achieve “a real victory for the resistance in Gaza and Palestine” and halt Israel's \"treacherous and brutal aggression against our oppressed and steadfast people in Gaza and the West Bank”.No other details were provided. The discussions in Beirut came as the war between Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that rules the Gaza Strip, is now in its third week.The fighting, triggered by Hamas' deadly incursion into Israel on October 7 that killed more than 1,400 people in Israel, has killed more than 5,700 Palestinians in Gaza.As the Gaza death toll spirals, tensions have also been rising along the tense Lebanon-Israel border, where Hezbollah members have been exchanging fire with Israeli troops since the day after Hamas' rampage into Israel.For now, those exchanges remain limited to a handful of border towns and Hezbollah and Israeli military positions on both sides. Lebanese army soldiers and United Nations peacekeeping forces have deployed in large numbers.Dozens of Hezbollah fighters have been killed in the clashes so far, the group says, while the Israeli military has also announced some deaths among its ranks.Nasrallah has yet to publicly speak about the war in Gaza and clashes along the Lebanon-Israel border. However, other Hezbollah top officials have warned Israel against its planned ground invasion into the besieged territory.Israeli officials have said they would retaliate aggressively in case of a cross-border attack by Hezbollah from Lebanon.“We will cripple it with a force it cannot even imagine, and the consequences for it and the Lebanese state (will be) devastating,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said while visiting Israeli troops along the border with Lebanon on Sunday.Lebanon's cash-strapped caretaker government, along regional and international figures, has been scrambling to keep the country out of the war.Hezbollah and Israel fought a month-long war in 2006 that ended in a tense stalemate. Israel sees Iran-backed Hezbollah as its most serious threat, estimating it has some 150,000 rockets and missiles aimed at Israel.\n",

      "Ten Nepali students have been killed and four others injured in Israel after the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a wave of rocket attacks in the country's southern region, Nepal's foreign ministry said on Monday.Hamas carried out a barrage of air strikes in Southern Israel on Saturday, killing over 600 people, including soldiers, and wounding more than 1,900.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in response launched multiple attacks targeting Hamas' key infrastructure. About 1,000 people have been killed in Israel and Gaza in the biggest escalation in decades between the two sides.In a press statement, the foreign ministry here said 10 Nepali nationals lost their lives in the recent attack by Hamas in Israel.Out of the 17 Nepali nationals working on a farm at Kibbutz Alumim, an area near the Gaza Strip, two safely escaped, four were injured and one is still missing, it said.\"We have received the information of the sad demise of ten Nepali nationals from the site, where the Hamas had launched an attack,” Nepal's embassy in Jerusalem said in a statement.All 10 people killed in the Hamas attack were students of agriculture from Sudur Paschim University in Western Nepal, according to ministry sources.There are currently 4,500 Nepali nationals working as caregivers in Israel. A total of 265 Nepali students are studying in Israel under the ‘Learn and Earn' programme of the Israeli government. Of them, 119 are from Agriculture and Forestry University, 97 from Tribhuvan University and 49 from Sudur Paschim University. All of them are bachelor-level students of agriculture.“We are trying to identify those killed in the incident. Efforts are being made to search for one missing student. The bodies will be brought back to Nepal soon after the identification is completed,” the embassy said.The Nepal government has also requested the Israeli government that necessary arrangements be provided to the injured people, who are undergoing treatment.The ministry said it was collaborating with the Israeli government and the embassy in Tel Aviv to bring back those nationals who want to return home.“Nepal government is committed to evacuate its nationals from the war-torn region at the earliest,” said the statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.“A meeting of the coordination mechanism formed under the leadership of Foreign Minister N P Saud is underway at the ministry to take stock of the situation in Israel, to identify Nepalese nationals and to make efforts for rescue Nepalese nationals if necessary,” read the statement issued by secretariat of Foreign Minster Saud.Nepal's main opposition CPN-UML has also asked Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal to talk to his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu to rescue the Nepalis, the Kathmandu Post newspaper reported.“Issuing statements and informing the House is not enough. The government must play the role of guardian of its citizens at this time of crisis,” said Padam Giri, the UML chief whip, in Parliament.The death toll in Israel is expected to rise as a large number of people have been critically wounded, according to the Israeli military.Palestinian health officials have said that more than 400 people have been killed, with over 2,000 injured.Hamas is a Palestinian Islamist militant group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The Gaza Strip is home to about 2.3 million people. It is a 41km-long and 10km-wide territory surrounded by Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.\n",
