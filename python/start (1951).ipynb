by eight separate livelihood classes  for every village and every ward of every town in the district· The handbooks  which are issued as State Government publications  also inciud  other items of information relating to the districts which could be readily assembled and seemed likely to be useful for purposes of reference  One hundred and twelve District Census Handbooks have been published already and the others are in the press  3  Census of India brochures  It will be noted that the statistical information contained in the AU India Census Report is limited to demographic and economic data relating to the country as a whole  Other types of data are published separately in a series of brochures  These are self contained papers  which present the relevant statistics with the minimum of introductory information required for their proper understanding and use  This series of brochures also includes a summary of demographic and economic data which it wa   found necessary to make available to the publil in advance of the main report  as we   as some which are of a spedalised nature  The following brochures have been published already    i  Final Population Totrus   it  Population Zones  Natural Regions  Sub Regions and Divisions   iii  Sample Verification of the 1951 Census Count   iv  Religion   v  Summary of Demographic and Economic Data  and  v%  Special Groups  The following brochures are in the press    z  Maternity Data   it   Languages   iii  Displaced Persons   iv  Age Tables   v  Life Tables   vz  Literacy and Educational Standards  and  vii  Subsidiary Tables  4  Cost  These are the end products of the 1951 Census  The total cost involved cannot be stated exactly until· after next year  But as most of the expenditure is known  the total can be estimated fairly closely  It is reckoned that the Central Government will have spent 149lakhs of rupees in all on the 1951  \fiv Census  This works out to a sum of Rs  41 12 per 1 000 persons enumerated  The corresponding rate for the 1931 Census  the last census for which full tabulation was undertaken  was Rs  15 8  The rise in the unit cost is smaller than the increase which has occurred in the general level of prices  wages and salaries since 1931   s   Preparation  The system of census·taking in India is somewhat unusual  It used to be likened in the past to the phoenix  the only bird of its kind which is reputed to complete its life cyc e by burning itself on the funeral pile and then to rise from the ashes with renewed youth to Jive through another cycle  Mr  M  W  M  YBATI S described it in somewhat less complimentary terms as follows    The system  if that word can be used here  is in brief that every 10 years some officer is appointed to conduct a census and officers to work under him are appointed in each province  The states take corresponding action  These appointments are made at the minimum of time beforehand and within one year questionnaires have to be settled  the whole country divided into enumeration units  a hierarchy of enumeration officers created and trained  millions of schedules 01 slips printed and distributed over the face of the country  the whole process of enumeration carried out and checked  tabuJation then carried out in offices located in any old pJace that can be found  on make shift pigeon hoJes and furnirure and with temporary staffs  rushed through the presses  and then  in the third year the whole system is wound up  the officers and the office staffs are dispersed and India makes haste to discard and forget as soon as possible all the experience so painfully brought together   Shortly after the transfer of power  Government decided to put an end to this reproach  The action taken by Government was described in the following terms by the late Sardar VALLABHBHAI PATEL  then Home Minister  when he inaugurated the first Census Conference    Ever since I assumed charge of the Home Ministry  I have been taking some interest in census matters and I was really very happy to have been instrumental in placing on the Statute Bock a permanent enactment dealing with the whole operation of Census             Hitherto  the Census used to be looked upon as a decennial operation for which haphazard temporary arrangemems used to be made  I have already stated that there is now a permanent Census Act on the Statute Book and Government have already a permanent office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner  It is our  \fv intention through this unified organisation to effect continuous improvement over the whole field of population data including the Census and vital statistics and to conduct experiments in sampling which would reduce not only the elaboration of these operations but also the cost   Mr  YEATIS  who had taken part in the 1931 Census as the Superintendent of Census Operations in Madras and directed the 1941 Census as Census Commissioner for India  was appointed Registrar General and ex officio Census Commissioner  Thanks to these arrangements  it was possible to begin advance planning for the 1951 Census somewhat earlier than at former censuses  A provisional questionnaire was drawn up   printing of census slips was taken in hand   a general outline of the scheme of operations was drawn up   and the officers were selected and earmarked for appointment as state census superintendents  Then  Mr  YEATIS fell ill and went on leave  I took charge of the census preparations in November 1949 as a temporary leave arrangement  in addition to my other duties in the Ministry of Rome Affairs  Unfortunately  Mr  YEATTS died in August 1950  when his responsibility devolved on me entirely  A definite stage in the preparatory period was reached during the last week of February 1950  when the newly appointed state census superintendents met in conference  We discussed the work before us in all aspects and achieved an agreed understanding of our tasks  Final orders of Government were obtained on the dates to be fixed for the census and on certain issues of policy affecting the scope of census enquiries  The questionnaire was finalised  as also a set of model all India instructions  Detailed local instructions were prepared by my colleagues in all the local languages  Census charges were delimited in every district  divided into census circles and sub divided into census blocks  the ultimate territorial unit for purposes of census enumeration  The census workers were selected and allotted to their respective charges  circles and blocks  They were supplied with forms and stationery  given oral as well as wrinen instructions  practised and tested  During the first week of February 1951  when the preparatory phase ended  a temporary organisation consisting of about 7 lakhs of field workers was got ready for action  The exact numbers  according to reports received  were as follows  5 93 518 cemus enumerators  grouped under the supervision and guidance of 80 006 census supervt sors  themselves directed by 9 854 census charge officers  6  EnumeratioD  The nature of the work entrusted to the field workers is clearly described in a message which was sent to them on the eve of  \fvi enumeration by Shri C  RAJAGOPALACHARI  then Home Minister of the Government of India    Dear colleagues in the Census work  This is the first census held under orders of the Republic of free India  I am addressing the enumerators in particular  You have the privilege and honour of taking a hand in the first census of free India  Ten years hence the next census will be held  Yours is the earliest privilege  You are an enumerator and therefore you build the very base of the whole big structure  The base is  as you know  the most important part of any structure  The record of your work will remain carefully kept for use throughout the next ten years   Enumeration begins at sunrise on the 9th day of February  From then upto sunrise on the 1st March you will be visiting all the houses in your block  locating all the people for whose enumeration you are responsible   and ascertaining and recording  in respect of all of them  the replies which are given to you for the prescribed census questions  On the 1st  2nd and 3rd days of March you will re visit all the houses for fina  check  You will then make sure that you have prepared the record of census enumeration in all respects as instructed  and hand it over to the supervisor   Yours is not an isolated local inquiry  You are one of about six hundred thousand patriots  all of whom will be engaged on an identical task at the same time  All of you are jointly responsible for enumerating all the people  Collectively you will prepare a record of basic facts relating to the life and livelihood of all the citizens and families in our Republic    If this record is to be correct and complete  the part which you contribute should  in itself  be correct and complete  You should master the simple instructions which you have received  and apply them uniformly and conscientiously  These instructions are based on a common plan for the country as a whole  Like a swarm of bees that build a beautiful hive according to the laws of geometry  each doing its part in obedience to a mystic urge  you should do your part according to conscience and the sense of truth inherent in us all  iMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEMBER   First   EVERY PERSON SHOULD BE ENUMERATED ONCE  AND NOT MORE THAN ONCE   Most people would be enumerated at their usual  \fvii  place of residence  There are a few who should be enumerated wherever they are found   Secondly   Do not grudge the time and effort which will be necessary to get correct and complete answers to the questions relating to ECONOMIC STATUS AND MEANS OF LIVELIHOOD    1 do hope you will take pride over the quality of your contribution to this nation wide enterprise and do your best  GOD BLESS YOU I  During the last 21 days of February 1951  6lakhs of census workers visited 644 lakhs of occupied houses and made enquiries  The information supplied to them by about 7 crores of citizens was recorded in 3 569 lakhs of census slips each of which was a dossier of one person  Then or later the more important items of the information contained in these dossiers were transcribed in the National Register of Citizens of which one part is allotted to every village and every ward of every town  The Register shows all the occupied houses and households arranged in numerical order  and against each household every line records the information relating to one member of the household  The census slips and the National Register of Citizens were the record of basic information collected during the 1951 Census  We ascertained the following particulars in respect of every person who was enumerated   i  Name  relationship to head of household  birth place  sex  age and marital status    iJ  Household economic status  employment status  if any   principal means of livelihood and subsidiary means of livelihood  if any   and  iiI  Nationality  religion  membership of  special group ·  if any   mother tongue  bilingualism  if any   literacy and educational standard  and particulars of displacement  for displaced persons only   In addition to these items which were common to all parts of India one other item was prescribed in each state by the State Government concerned   7  Tabuladon  The second phase of census operations  viz   enumeration ended with the second visit to all houses carried out during the first three days of March and the report by the field workers of the number counted by them  These reports were transmitted from the block  circle and charge  through the district administrative hierarchy  to state census superintendents and to me  and the  Provisional Totals  based on them published during the second fortnight of ApriJ 1951 for districtS  states and the country as a whole  The third pbase commenced during April May 1951  with the opening of 52 temporary tabulation  This relates to Scheduled Castes  Scheduled TrilJe s  Anglo Indians and certain classes treated pro isionally as  backward  for purpose  of the Census   \fviii  offices  sited at convenient centres in all parts of the country   and the arrival at these offices of the census slips and National Register of Citizens together with abstracts and relevant information prepared by local officers  The manner in which these offices were to be organised  workers recruited and trained  and the nature of the work to be performed in these offices had been planned in advance  The main principles were discussed and settled in a conference held during the last week of December 1950  Very detailed instructions designed to secure rigid uniformity of forms and procedures as well as safeguards against error had been settled and issued  There were three stages in the working of these offices  The first was   sorting and compilation   at the end of which  the numbers relating to each item of information were extracted from the census slips by sorters on what are called   sorter s tickets  and then put together by compilers in  posting statements  for the smaller territorial units within each district  This was the most important stage of tabulation  It was also the most expensive since the tabulation offices were at maximum strength while it was in progress  According to detailed information available about all the 52 offices except one  Hyderabad  for which figures are not available  47 218 man months were used up in this process of sorting and compilation  It took 10 4 sorter months  2  4 compiler months and 1 1 supervisor months to sort and compile the dossiers of one lakh of people·t The second stage of tabulation consists in processing the compilers  posting statements into the main census tables in the form prescribed for all states  the institution of arithmetical checks and counter checks for avoidance of error  and finally their scrutiny and independent check in a central tabulation office set up within my office  The final tables are then prepared for the press and go out as separate parts containing purely statistical material with brief introductions and explanations  The third stage of tabulation consists in the preparation of what are called  subsidiary tables  and constitutes statistical preparation for the  next pbasefJtz   study and report  The aim at this stage is two fold  One is to work out derivative data such as rates and percentages so as to institute comparison between the 1951 Census data and the corresponding data of previous censuses  The other is to work out the inter connections between the census data and other important data  these are mainly vital statistics and cultivation statistics   Hf re tIn other countriel  eleetrically operated machinery is used at this ltage  thus rendering the employment of alarge staft  unnecenary  A proposal that such machinery  hould be used at this census in oder to carry out u part of the work was considered carefully and decided againlt  on the ground that it would certainly increase the cost and  in 1111 probability  take more time  Subsequent experience has not indicated any reason to rell et  he decision to rely entirely on human agency   \fix  again  identical forms and instructions were prescribed in advance  A special difficulty of a fairly formidable character was presented by the fact that the boWldaries of India as well as of almost all states and a great many districts had Wldergone very extensive changes after the 15th August  1947  All the relevant statistical data of earlier years had to be recomputed for the new territorial units  and the manner in which this was done had to be clearly explained  The three stages mentioned above are applicable to the work done in the tabulation offices controlled by my colleagues  The second and third of these three stages were reproduced in the central tabulation office  where the all India tables were prepared on the basis of state tables which had been checked in this office and approved for publication  8  Study and Report  It has been a regular feature of all prtvious censuses  except that of 1941 when practically all tabulation except the basic population totals and community totals was dispensed with  that the census organisation did not content itself with the bare presentation of statistical data  The data were subjected to careful study and the results of the study were embodied in narrative reports of quite considerable length  Three blOad purpo es were sought to be served by such study   Firsl   It was necessary to assess the value  in terms of completeness  reliability and comparability of the data procured and furnish such comments and explanations as would be helpful to users of census statistics  The officers who trained the field staff and scrutinised the basic record in the various stages of tabulation were in the best position to do this work   Secondly   Much of the material collected at successive censuses is of an identical nature or at any rate relatable and comparable  A comparative study  with the help of the subsidiary tables already mentioned  helped to bring out evidence of changes in various characteristics which were usually important and significant either directly as matters of public interest or as the raw material for more specialised economic and social enquiries which might be Wldertaken by others   and  Thirdly   There are a great many topics of interest relating to the social and economic life of the people  Where the officers in charge of census operations were specially interested in any of them  they were in a position to collect and study the relevant data along with the routine study referred to above and the results were set out in the form of specialised discussion of such topics   \fThe Census Commissioner and the Superintendents are chosen primarily with reference to their intimate knowledge of the administrative machinery whose services are required to be mobilised as well as their capacity for general management of staff employed on governmental duties  rather than for any specialised knowledge or aptitude for making statistical computation or for carrying  out economic and social research  The quality of the result achieved by their study was  therefore  of a varying nature  Almost all reports were characterised by their painstaking thoroughness  while the intellectual standard set by some reports was conspicuously high  Careful consideration was given  on this occasion  to the question whether precedent should be followed at all or whether the census organisation might content itself with bare presentation of statistical material  The conclusion was reached that it was essential that the first and second of these three purposes should be secured as satisfactorily as possible within the time  and that the officers should exercise their discretion in respect of the third  In one respect  however  a departure from precedent was clearly stipulated from the outset  The 1951 Census was not to concern itself with questions regarding races  castes and tribes  except in so far as the necessary statistical material relating to  special groups  was to be published and certain other material relating to backward classes collected and made over to the Backward Classes Commission  On the other hand  it was also enjoined that the maximum possible attention should be paid to economic data  The instructions which were issued to state census superintendents about the preparation of state census reports indicated the general structure required  and concluded with a statement of objective in the following terms    It does not matter if available material does not permit of analysis sufficiently definite for reaching conclusions           It does not also matter if the time available to reporting officers is insufficient for carrying out even such analysis as may be permitted by the material  What is essential is that the prescribed subsidiary tables should be correctly prepared and the reporting officers should apply their mind to these tables and attempt a review on the lines indicated •               The reports thus prepared will be of value mainly as the starting point of more detailed studies  to be undertaken subsequently  of the inter relationships of population changes and economic changes in the country as a whole  as well as in the different states and natural divisions of the country  If this purpose is served  reporting officers will have discharged their duty   All state census superintendents have been proceeding on these lines generally in preparing their reports  It should be emphasised here that the  \fxi views expressed in these reports written by different officers are of a purely personal nature  They should not be regarded as committing Govemmen t in any manner to any particular expression of opinion on controversial issues of any kind  While the study of census data organised on the lines above described was proceeding  public interest in the popUlation problem was increasing rapidly  The Planning Commission took cognisance of the subject and initiated group discussions in which I also took part  The report of the Planning Commission embodies specific proposals and visualises the collection of data bearing on the problem  partly as the basis for action by Government and partly as material for consideration by a Commission  the setting up of which is mentioned as a possibility  In these circumstances  I felt that an all India report on the 1951 Census would be materially incomplete  if it failed to deal adequately with the population problem of the country  I have accordingly set out a clear and full statement of my own personal appreciation of the problem and what I conceive to be the correct solution  As explained already the views expressed in the report are of a purely personal nature and should not be understood to commit Government in any manner whatsoever   9  Arrangement of the All India Report  The AU India Report  as already mentioned  is divided into five parts  Three of these parts  PARTS II A  II B and II C  consist of statistical tables  accompanied by introductory notes which explain the manner in which the data were secured and the tables were compiled  PART I A is the narrative report proper and PART I B consists of the ApPENDICES  The report is divided into five chapters  The first three chapters present the picture as observed in 1951  The first chapter  entitled   The Land and the People 1951  focusses  attention on the area of land per head of population available in the country as a whole  describes how this varies in different parts of the country and how this variation is relatable to variations in topography  soil and rainfall  Mter dividing the country into 5 natural regions and IS sub regions in terms of these factors  a description is given of the salient facts of population and land use in three groups of sub regions which are distinguished from one another as high  low and medium density sub regions  Finally a comparison is instituted  with other countries of the world which leads to the conclusion not only that there is a very notable shortage of  land area per capita  in our COWltry but that the utilisation of usable land within this  \fxii limited area has proceeded very far already  A great deal of statistical information  in parts newly ascertained  has been brought together in APPENDIX I  Population and Land Use  and used as the basis for the account given in the first chapter  The second chapter is headed  The Pattern of Living 1951   It begins with an account of total numbers and numbers in different size groups of villages and towns and the distribution of the people among them  Then there is a description of houses and households  information regarding the relative proportion of households of different size groups as well as their composition being a new feature of this census  TIllS is followed by a description of the variations of the sex ratio in different parts of the country  The age structure of our people is then described and compared with that of other countries of the world  The last two sections of this chapter contain much material which is both new and important  It is welJ known that data based on registration of births and deaths are both incomplete and defective  But a serious and largely successful attempt was made on this occasion to put them to the fullest use by separating the grain from the chaff and studying them in combination with census data and all other data which were capable of throwing some light on the subject  A systematic study of the whole subject is contained in ApPENDIX II  Note on Birth Rates and Death Rates   As a result of this study  reasonably firm conclusions are reached regarding the levels  which prevailed during the decade ending 1950   of our true birth rates and death rates  as distinguished from our registered birth rates and death rates   Estimates are furnished not only for India as a whole  but six broad zones  North India  East India  South India  West India  Central India and North West India    and they are then compared with similar rates of other countries  The information presented in the last section of this chapter entitled  Maternity Pattern  is even more important  Thanks to the wise use made by certain State Governments of the  local option  given to them to put one question of their choice  very valuable data have been secured about the average number of children born to mothers of different age groups  Careful analysis of the data thus secured has yielded  for the first time  a clear picture of the pattern of maternity in this country and permits a comparison with the corresponding pattern in other countries  These statistics have led me to a new form of presentation of the solution  for the population problem which  I believe  offers definite practical advantages  These are explained in the last chapter  The third chapur entitled  Livelihood Pattern 1951  begins with the  India Picture   It contains a complete accounting of how the people obtain their means of livelihood  The next section explains how the pattern varies from one zone to another  The last section brings out the main  \fxiii features of contrast between the pattern in India and the pattern in Great Britain and the United States of America  The account given in this chapter is furnished in as simple terms as possible  but serious students are sure to have very exacting standards of precision in respect of definitions and classifications  In order to meet their needs  a systematic review of a more formal nature has been prepared and included in the report as APPENDIX III  Review of Census Economic Data   In this review a full account is given of the pitfalls to be avoided in instituting comparison of the data between one part of the country and another for the same census  and between two different censuses for the same territory  and the limitations subject to which it is possible to draw significant conclusions   The fourth chapter is headed   Before and Since 1921   This  like the three previous chapters  is strictly factual  but it lays the foundation on which the assessment of the popUlation problem presented in the last chapter is subsequently erected  It is a fundamental conclusion of the study  of which the results are set out in this report  that 1921 is the  Great Divide   Our pattern of growth subsequent to that year is entirely unlike the pattern of growth before that year  The fact that there is a sharp contrast is first established by a detailed analysis of the relevant figures of all parts of India  Then the reasons which account for that fact are established by documentary evidence  The growth of population had been checked by famine and pesti1ence repeatedly before 1921  Except for one tragic exception  population grew unchecked after 1921  APPENDIX IV  Famine and Pestilence   which contains relevant extracts from old reports  furnishes in detail the evidence which is summarised in the first section of this chapter  The next section is devoted to showing that 1921 is the  Great Divide  in another resrect  before 1921  cultivation had more than kept pace with the growth of popUlation  after 1921  cultivation was lagging far behind while the popUlation total was forging ahead  Developing the conception of  land area per capita   we have the area of cultivated land per capita  and based on it  of productivity of cultivation per capita  This had been stationary or moving up before 1921  after 1921  it was falling steeply  The value of the material presented in this section consists in this   great care has been taken to sift available data about cultivation  locate the areas for which statistics of high quality are available on a comparable basis over a long period and then work out the results for these areas  The third section sets out the results of the comparative study contained in APPENDIX III and explains how the livelihood pattern has been changing in response  to unchecked growth of population and the decline of cultivation per capila  The economic strength of the average household is seen to have weakened  The last section of this chapter brings out the final and most important aspect of the  Great Divide   Notwithstanding the famines of the last  \fxiv century  India used to be surplus in food  Round about 1921   India developed a shortage of foodgrains and this shortage has been growing ever sinceslowly bu t steadily  The relevant statistics have been brought together from different sources and they bring out unmistakably how the change came about over a series of years  The change over is dealt with in different aspects  First  there are the statistics of imports and exports of grains already referred to  Then  there are the statistics of grain prices  for which  thanks to the completeness of information available with the Government of Madras  we can form a good picture for the last 150 years and institute an illuminating comparison with the trend of grain prices in the United States of America   Finally  there is the profoWld change in the whole conception of the responsibilities of the State jn respect of the supply and distribution of grains  the breakdown offree trade  the Bengal Famine  and the development of  state trading system  on which crores of our people depend to day  The evidence in support of material conclusions in the analysis made in this section is presented fully in APPENDIX V  Shortage of Foodgrains   The last chapter entitled  The Prospect 1981  poses the question   what will be the pattern of our growth during the next thirty years  We know whither the current on which we have been drifting since 192 1 is taking us  We also know of the great attempts now being made to stop this dangerous drift and steer the ship of State to safety  How  strong is the current  And how strong are these attempts  How is a favourable outcome to be assured   These questions are discussed at length and firm conclusions reached  Much of the evidence in support of material conclusions of the analysis in this chapter is set out in ApPENDIX VI  Old Irrigation Project8 and Irrigation Development Projects  and APPENDIX VII  Maternity Data and Birth Control   It is fully realised and made clear at every stage of the discussion that the nature of the material is such that widely varying views can be and are being held both in respect of the facts themselves and the appreciation of the significance of the facts  As the Royal Commission in the United Kingdom observed  parts of the subject may be likened to that fabled morass where armies whole have sunk    The various views held ·on the subject are set out and reasons given for reaching a particular conclusion  The busy reader may  at this stage  turn over to the last section of the last chapter and read the conclusion straightaway  10  Acknowledgements  Though  the CONSTITUTION lays the duty of census taking exclusively on the Central Government the census is carried out for the benefit of the entire State which  according to the CONSTITUTION  includes the Government  and Parliament of India and the Government and the Legislature of each of the States and all local or other authorities  \fxv  within the territory of India or under the control of the Government f    I t gIves   Ind18  me  great pI~asure to report that this was fully realised0   and the census receIved unstlnted support and ready assistance from the Governments of all states as well as all other authorities   ~ census  like its predecessors  was made possible by the efforts of about SIX lakhs of public spi~~ed census workers who made the enquiries and the seven crores or so of CItIzens who gave them the information asked for  ~e fact  that this is the first census of free India was appreciated by all and It contributed greatly to the success of th0 undertaking  The press throughout the country  as I have gratefully acknowledged once before  was consistently helpful and gave effective publicity and support to the census at all important stages  The results of the labours of my colleagues will be before the public  Where al1 have given of their best  it would be invidious to name anyone for special mention  I should  however~ place on record my tribute of admiration for Shri J  D  KERAWALLA whose enthusiasm for the work was infectious and whose untiring exertions may have contributed to the malady of which he died before his report could be published  A number of officers helped me to direct the census and write this report  Shri D  NATARAJAN who was on Mr  YEATTS  staff both in 1931 and 1941 has not only contributed his personal knowledge of prior censuses but also borne a heavy burden of administrative responsibility as Assistant Census Commissioner  Without his help I could not have held charge of two distinct offices  I have also benefitted by Shri NATARAJAN S advice and suggestions in drafting my report  Shri P  N  KAUL had no previous experience of government offices When he was called upon to fWlction as the statistical conscience keeper not only for me but all the state census superintendents  He did this to the satisfaction of all of us  He organised the central tabulation office  trained and led a temporary staff which constructed all the all India tables and checked a11 the state census tables  Shri T  V  RANGARAJAN and Shri SHANKAR KApOOR rendered notable assistance  in the collection and analysis of material for my use  as well as in checking the drafts and preparing them for the press  All the members of this able team  and the other members of the staff have worked long hours over a long period ungrudgingly and have still got much to do in seeing all this material through the press  This report is as much theirs as mine and I am very grateful to them  I have drawn freely on the resources of other Ministries and Departments who have ungrudgingly offered all facilities  The Ministry of Labour spared the services of Shri S  P  JAIN who prepared the Age Tables and Life Tables   \fxvi  and whose initial study of the statistics of registration of births and deaths in combination with census data was the starting point of the systematic analysis of demographic data furnished in this report  The Planning Commission spared the services of Dr  V  NATH who helped me to formulate the scheme of natural regions and sub regions and to build up parts of the statistical material presented in APPENDICES I and VI  including in particular  the data re lating to  decline of cultivation per capita   I valued his advice and suggestions based on his study of conditions in foreign countries as well as his knowledge of discussion and study within the Planning Commission  The Adviser of the Planning Commission on Health Programmes  Dr  T  LAKSHMINARAYANA spared time for many discussions which clarified the issues relating to birth control  His experienced judgment gave me confidence in putting forward definitive conclusions in a highly controversial field  Much material was specially compiled for me by the Surveyor General of India  the Director Gencr~l of Observatories  Meteorological Department   the Director of Geological Survey of India  the Inspector General of Forests  the Economic and StatistIcal Adviser  Ministry of Food and Agriculture  the Statistical Adviser  Indian Council of Agricu1tural Research  and the Head of the Division of Chemistry  Indian Agricultural Research Institute  The Directorate General of Health Services spared the services of Shri KHUSHI RAM  who prepared most of the maps and all the diagrams in this report  Publicity arrangements for the census were in the hands of Shri V  KRISHNASWAMI of the Press Infonnation Bureau  who took keen personal interest for which I am grateful  In tliese days the pressure on the Government Press is extremely heavy and Shri C  A  SUBRAHMANYAM  Controller of Printing   Stationery  India bas a very difficult task to perform  But the Censu    of India is an old customer and there has never been any doubt about the anxiety of all concerned in the Government Press to do their best to ensure that census printing is attended to efficiently and speedily  I have every confidence that the work that still remains to be done will be done well   NEW DELHI   1st August  1953  R  A  GOPALASWAMI

in order to help us achieve du~ ~gh  pprposes eashrined jn our CONSTITUTION   \fCHAPTER I  THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE  I 95 1  A   Land Area per capita THIS REPORT cannot be easy reading  It is loaded with figures  and figures are wearisome  It is all the more necessary  therefore  that attention should be drawn  at the outset  to two figures which are of fundamental importance  They are  First    81 crores of acres   This is the total area of our land  Secondly    36 crores of people   This was the population of the Indian Union at some point of time between tho 26th January  1950 when the Indian Union was born and the 1st March  1951  the reference date of the Census  4  Can these figures be relied on as correct   Yes  There is no room for reasonable doubt on the point  The first figure  81 crores of acres  and indeed all figures of land area which are borne on the books of tht  Survey of India  are perhaps the most accurate among the national statistics of India  or  for that matter  of any country in the world   They are based 011 exact measurements  scientifically designed and carried our by a highly trained professional agency over a long series of years  5  The 195 1 Census count yielded a total of 356 879 394 as the number present at sunrise on the 1st March  1951  May we take it that the count was correct  if not to  the last integer  at least to the nearest lakh  May we take it as certain that the number was 3 569Iakhs  No  That would be rating the completeness of the census count too high  We have indeed made the best possible effort to take a correct cOWlt  There are very good reasons to believe that the count must have been at least as close to the truth on this occasion as at any previous census in India  But until recently we had no knowledge about how close to the truth the census COWlt used to be in the past  At this census  Government decided that a verification of the census count shou1d be carried out under conditions designed te yield reliable information on this point  The results of that operation have been published   already along with a detailed account of the manner in which the verification was carried out  The conclusion has been stated thus    For every thousand persons included in the census count 11 other persons were probably omitted  It is a reasonably safe conclusion that the number of persons omitted  per thousand counted  could not have exceeded 12 or fallen short of 10   •  Sample Ve~ification of the 1951 Census Count   Census of India Paper No 1 of 19M   ~  \fLAND AREA PER CAPITA  6  From this it would follow that the actual number of people present  at sunrise of the 1st March  1951  must have exceeded the published total by not less than 36 lakhs and not more than 43 lakhs  It is convenient to express the same result in another way  We may say that the published total of 35 crores and 69 lakhs represented the actual number of people present not indeed on the 1st March 1951  the reference date of the Census  but on some other day a few months earlier  Our knowledge of the rate at which our numbers are growing in recent years  this will be explained in a later chapter  helps us to fix this earlier date within fairly narrow limits  It must have preceded the census day by not less than 10 months and not more than 12 months  On some day in MarchApril 1950  it is reasonably certain the census count of 35 crores and 69 lakhs represented the exact number of people present in the territory covered by the 1951 Census  7  But the territory covered by the 1951 Census is not quite the same thing as the territory of India  There is a fringe of tribal territory in the northeast frontier  known as the Part B Tribal Areas of Assam  where the census has never been taken  A figure of about six lakhs of people has been mentioned as the probable number of people living there  Though little better than a guess  it indicates the order of magnitude which might be borne in mind  When preparations for the 1951 Census were taken in hand  it became clear that a complete count was impossible in the conditions prevailing in the state of Jammu and Kashmir  Government decided that the information likely to be secured by an incomplete count was not worth the effort  expense and very considerable strain on administrative resources  which arc necessarily involved in census taking  Hence the entire state of Jammu and Kashmir had to be excluded from the census count  It is possible  however  from past census figures to make a fairly firm estimate of the population of Jammu and Kashmir  This may be taken to be about «lakhs  It is reasonably safe on these facts to conclude   First   chat the total  number of people living in India had passed the 36 crore mark well before the census day  and Secondly   that it had not reached that figure on 26th January  1950   8  Given the two basic figures  81 crores of acres and 36 crores of peoplewe may derive a third  namely    2 1 4 acres   This is our  land area per capita   Let us suppose that the entire territory of India is divided  with mathematical exactitude  equally among all the people living in India  we may each  The title of this chapter   The Land and the People I9SI    81 well as aU other statements made about the people  as enumerated at the 1951 Census  should therefore be

that if we tried to look at all of them at once    we shtrU miss the wood for the trees and get lost in a parade of local peculiarities whkh1may ·have· no· real significance in  the all i Jrtdin

some zones of India have got more land per head than their fellow citizens in other zones  Does this mean that the former are much better off than the latter  Central India  for instance  provides 354 cents of land  which is more than three times as large as the land area per capita in North India  115 cents  Are the people of Madhya Pradesh  Hyderabad and Madhya Bharat three times as rich as those of Uttar Pradesh   Obviously  this cannot be  For all we know to the contrary  lIS cents of land in North India may provide even better living than 354 cents of land in Central India  Evidently  we should not attempt to draw conclusions of practical significance from the figures in T ABl E I  until we have gone some way towards understanding the differences between the different sorts of land there are in clifferent pans of the country  and assessed the significance of those differences for purposes of growing foad or otherwise providing a means of living out of the land  Among the major factors which make a difference in this respect  the first is topography  the nature of the terrain or the land form of the tracts in question  13  Out of India s total land area of 81 crores and 26 lakhs of acres  8 crores and 69lakhs of acres  or 10 7 per cent  lie in mountains  The word  mountain  is used in this context in a strict sense  it is limited to really steep land at a very high elevation and generally excludes all land below a limit of 7 000 feet above sea level  Nearly two thirds of such mountain tracts  S crores and 48 lakhs of acres  arc found in Jammu and Kashmir  The remaining one third is distributed in three zones as follows  141 lakhs of acres in East India   97 lakhs of acres in North West India  excluding Jammu   Kaslunir j and 79 lakhs of acres in North India   Rather less than S 1akhs of acres are to be found in South India  There are no mountains  in the strict sense of the term  in West India and Central India  Mountains are impressive affairs  even inspiring  to people who live far away from them and go there for rest and recreation or occasional business  But they are of little use for settlement of people who wish to cultivate the land arid  grow food  In general the land is far too steep  It is extremely difficult to find  or make  plots of land on which food or other crops may be gro~  Scholars who have made a special study of this subject estimate that 6  \fTOPOGRAPHY  SOIL AND RAiNFALL  95 per cent of the superficial area of land in mountain tracts should be writtel   off  from the point of view of practical farming   14  The write off is not so heavy when we tum to other kinds of tracts  It has been suggested that the appropriate ratios are 75 per cent in hilly tracts  2S per cent in plateaus and perhaps as low as 5 per cent in the plains  We may use the term  hill  to cover all kinds of weathered highlands  except mountains  without reference to the level at which they are situated  The term would include practically the entire area of all ranges other than the Himalayan and also the foothills of the Himalayan range upto the limit already mentioned   about 7 000 feet above sea level  Hilly tracts as thus defined comprise 15 crores and 9 lakhs of acres  or 18 6 per cent  of all land in India  They are distributed as follows   525 lakhs of acres in East India  333 lakhs of acres in Central In dia  278 lakhs of acres in South India  and 198 lakhs of acres in West India   There are 88 lakhs of acres in North West India outside Janunu and Kashmir and there are 27 lakhs of acres in Janunu and Kashmir  There are 41 lakhs of acres in North India and 21 lakhs in Andaman and Nicobar Islands   15  Plateaus may be defined  in the conditions of this country  as including all relatively fiat tracts of land which lie between one thousand feet and three thousand feet above sea level  Such tracts measure 22 crores and 48 lakhs of acres  or 27 7 per cent of all land in India  Almost exactly one half of all plateaus  II crores and 25 lakhs of acres  is found in Central India  The remaining half is distributed as follows   300 lakhs of acres in North We~t India  excluding Jammu   Kashmir   286 lakhs of acres in South India  284 lakhs of acres in West India  and 204 lakhs of acres in East India   A fringe of North India measuring 341akhs of acres is also plateau land  16  Finally  we may

It is not to be supposed that all topographically usable area is culti vable  Even within this area  there are large extents of land which are little   better than barren rock and have little or no soil cover  We should now consider   the nature and extent of sOlI cover available for land in different parts of the  country  Unfortunately such information as we have been able to get together is mostly of a descriptive nature  There is next to no information of a quantitative character about the actual areas or productivity in terms of crop yields per acre of different types of soils  The following is a very brief summary of ~ av ailable information    i  Four main groups of soils are fOWld extensively allover India  Among them  the alluvial group is by far the most productive  They arc distributed over practically the whole of the Gangetic plains in Uttar Pradesh  West Bengal and extend to the PWljab and parts of Assam and Orissa  The coastal tracts of southern India arc also alluvial  especially at the mouths of the rivers  where they arc known as deltaic alluvium  The soils arc deficient in phosphoric acid  nitrogen and humus  but not generally in potash and lime  Interspersed within the alluvial group  are patches of saline and alkaline soils which contain varying amounts of soluble salts  Such type of soils are fOWld in Uttar Pradesh   usar  land   Bombay Deccan 8l1d a portion of North Bihar    ii  Then there are the black soils which are loamy to clayey in texture  vary in depth  and contain lime katzkar in varying percentages  and free calcium carbonate  These soils are generally suitable for c ultivation of cotton and are known in many places as  black cotton soils  or  regur   Resembling tropical black earth  they arc vcry welldefined soils which occupy the greater part of Bombay and Saurashtra  western parts of Madhya  Pradesh  Madhya Bharat  and Hyderabad and some parts of Madras including the districts of Tirunelveli   and Ramanathapuram  The soils are fairly fertile and very useful fur commercial crops  They are generally deficient in nitrogen  phosphoric acid and organic matter   but potash and  lime are usually high      iiI  Another fairly well  defilled and extensive group consists of red soils   They differ widely in depth and fertility in different parts of India and are generally of mediUll  to low fertility   They cover verYIhq ge  tracts of Madras  MYiore  south east Bombay    east lIyderabad  T9  \fCHAPTER I  THE LAND AND THE l EOPLE I95t  and a strip of tract running along the eastern part of Madhya Pradesh to Cbhota Nagpur and Orissa  In the north  the red soil area extends into and includes the   greater part of the Santhal Parganas in Bihar  the Birbhum district of West Bengal  the  Mirzapur  Jhansi and Hamirpur districts of Uttar Pradesh  northern portion of Madhya Bharat  the Aravallies and the eastern half of Rajasthan   iv  The last of the four main groups consists of laterite and lateritic soils  Soils of this group are derived by the atmospheric weathering of several types of rocks under monsoon conditions of alternating dry and wet periods  Well developed laterite and lateritic soils are found on the summits of hills of the Deccan  Madhya Bharat  Madhya Pradesh  and of the Rajmahal and Eastern Ghats  and certain parts of Orissa  Bombay  Malabar and Assam  The soils are deficient in potash  phosphoric acid and lime  On higher levels these soils are exceedingly thin and gravelly  but on lower levels and in the valleys they consist of heavy loams and clays  On the whole  these soils are poor   v  Other miscellaneous types of soils include desert or arid soils occurring in the regions having low rainfall  e  g   Ajmer  eastern Rajasthan etc  Marshy or peaty soils occur over small areas in Travancore  and in parts of West Bengal  Orissa and Madras  Hill soils  which arc generally sandy or red loam occur in the hilly regions of West Bengal  Punjab and Assam  20  We cannot grow food unless we have topographically usable land with at least the minimum of useful soil  But land alone will not do  even if it is perfectly level and has the most fenile soil cover  it cannot be used to grow food or any other crops unless there is rain   The amount of rain that falls on Indian territory every year  and year after year  is something colossal  Let us consider an inch of rain falling en an acre of land  The water which thus collects disappears from view very quickly and one does not  therefore  appreciate the fact that the quantity is qtrite large   the weight of this water is no less than 2 800 maunds  On an average of good  bad and indifferent years  and taking into account all parts of the country  we get rather more than 42 inches of rain falling on every acre of land every year  That is to say  we get well over one lakh of maunds of water on every acre of land  We have noted already that there are 81 crores of acres  Those who feel curious about the total amount of our rain water supply may do the multiplication 10  \f fOPOGRAPttv  SOli  ANti RAI~Fili  sum for th~ms~lves 1 If only this enormous amount of rain fell evenly both in space and m trme  the amount of food which is now grown on our land can be gr~tly increased  Unfortunately  nature distributes rain even more Wlevenly t~ soils    Some tracts get too much rain  many get too little  A great deal of ram falls ill such places and at such times that it cannot be used to any good purpose  21  One of the maps at the beginning of this chapter shows the division of the country into five  rainfall belts  which have been named as follows   Rainfall belt Blue belt Dark green belt Light green belt Brown belt  Yellow belt    Annual rainfall Exceeding 75 inches j Between 50 and 75 inches  Between 30 and 50 inches  Between 15 and 30 inches  Bchnv IS inches   The blue belt and the dark green belt cover almost exactly a third of the country  They are well provided with enough rain  which is generally  though not invariably  also dependable  The light f  Teen belt covers almost exactly another third of the country  Here the rainfall  if timely  is adequate  but the vagaries of the monsoon arc apt to cause occasional failure of crops and consequent distress  The brown belt and the yellow belt  taken together  cover the remaining third of the country  Here the seasonal fluctuations are so frequent  that they are more or less regularly expected  and when they occur  they cause a great deal of hardship to the people and expense to Government  The yellow belt has so little rain that a great many people do not live there  The brown belt where one fourth of our people live  is exposed to special hazards which are a permanent problem for the people and the Government  22  If we are to make an intelligent study of why the people happen to be as unequally distributed as they are in different parts of our cOWltry  it is essential we should get behind the existing political divisions of the country into states and their grouping in zones  We should visualise the country as consisting of different parts which are distinguished from one another by differences of topography  soil  rainfall  the major factors which determine how much of  land  can be used to grow food and the degree of its usefulness for the purpose  These  in turn  determine how many people could make a living on the land  From the point of view merely of topography  the country may be divided notionally into five broad  regions   viz    1  the Himalayan region   2  the

Coorg and Travancorc Cochin  Two hundred and thirty eight lakhs of people live here in an area covering 239 lakhs of acres  In terms of India  the population percentage is 6  6 and the land area percentage is 2  9  The land area per capita consists of 100 cents  The terrain here is such that it is impossible to demarcate a topographically homogeneous territory without cutting clear across administrative boundaries down to district level  So  the sub region includes the main chain of the Western Ghats as well as the narrow fringe of coastal plains to its west  Areas of very varied topography are  therefore  necessarily included  and there are corresponding variations in rainfall  The pattern of land utilisation and density of settlement of population differ sharply as between

about 32 lakhs of acres in the dark green belt  The average number of rainy days ranges from 121 in West Madras  118  in Coorg and Travancore Cochin to 95 in Bombay Konkan and 74 in Greater Bombay  The sub region is  therefore  one of the very few parts of India  of which it can be said that it never suffers from drought  Out of the total area of 239 lakhs of acres  the topographically usable

five sub regions  while it is 33 to 38 per cent for India  1Il  The distribution of the land among different rainfall belts is also more favourable in the high density sub regions as shown in TABLE 5 TABLE 5· It should be noted that the ratios of land falling in the Percentage of lotalland area blue belt and the dark green belt       are very nearly the same in High density India sub regions

high density sub regions and the country as a whole is considerably narrowed down  The figure is 50 cents for the former and 79 ccnts for the latter  From what has already been said it is clear that  acre for acre  the sown area in the high density sub region    must be more productive than the sown area elsewhere in India  because it includes a much larger proportion of the fertile alluvium of the plains  and a much smaJ er proportion of the less fertile  soils of the plateaus  Higher natural fertility enables less land to be left fallow  while more ampJe rainfall enables more land to be irrigated and more land to be sown more than once  The comparative figures of land use are shown in TABLE 6 on next page   19  \fCHAPTER r  THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE I951 TABLE 6 High dcnsity  Indices

Density Sub Regions WE MAY NOW tum by way of contrast to those sub regions where dt  llsicy is low and the land area per capita is correspondingly high  The extreme instance is the Desert sub region and next in order arc the two Himalayan sub regions  Lastly  there are three sub regions in the northern half of the Peninsular Hills and Plateau region  in all of which the density is well below the mean in India  On the whole  the six sub regions cover a little less than one half of India s land  and the people living there number only between one fifth and one fourth of India s population  The following table shows the population  land area  density and land area per capita of these six sub regions  TABLE 7  Density N arne of sub region  The Desert Western Himalayas   Eastern Himalayas

topography  soil and rainfall which distinguish these sub regions from others  the nature of land use and its relation to the density of settlement of the people  31  THE DESERT   This sub region consists of the following western districts of Rajasthan  Ganganagar  Bikaner  Churu  Jodhpur  Barmer  Jalore Pall  Nagore and Jaisalmer  The greater part of the sub region consists of a land surface on which there is no running water  There are some groups of hills occurring in the eastern part of Jodhpur on the western side of the Aravalli range  Out of the total land area per capita  namely 1 047 cents  971 cents are in plains 63 cents are in plateaus and 13 cents are in hills  Two hundred and fiftyfour lakhs of acres  that is to say  552 cents per capita  are  as already explained  hardly capable of supporting life to any significant extent  They must be left out of the reckoning  EvC Il of the rest  the soils in the south  central and western areas are mostly light and sandy  Fertile patches increase from west to east  The greater part of the sub region  90 per cent  faUs in the yellow belt  In fact  it is three quarlers of the entire yellow belt  The remaining ten per cent of the SUb region lies in the brown belt  The average rainfall over the whole area is II inches and the average number of rainy days only 13  Village land records are available for only 81 lakhs of acres out of 482  According to available figures  the nct area sown per capita is 68 cents  Double crop is negligible  There is a certain amount of localised irrigations The fallow percentage is large and forests are non existent  There are reasons to believe that cultivation acreages of this sub region are under stated  So the net area sown per capita is probably marc than 68 cents  It is difficult to make any sort of estimate as to what the true figure might be  but it seems unlikely that it can be any very considerable proportion of the land area per capita  Mineral production in the sub region consists mainly of salt from Sambhar lake  and gypsum in Bikaner and Jaisalmer  which accounts for most of the country s output   A small quantity of low quality coal is also produced in Bikaner    32  WESTERN HIMAI AYAS  This sub region consists of the entire state of Jammu and Kashmir  two districts of the Punjab  Kangra and Simla   Himachal Pradesh  Bilaspur and five districts of Uttar Pradesh  Garhwal  Tehri Garhwal  Nainital  Almora and Dehra Dun   Ninety lakhs of people live on 852 lakhs of acres here  J aromu and Kashmir accounts for an estimated 44lakhs of people on 594 lakhs of acres with a land area per capita of no less than 1 345 cents  This state is  therefore  even more sparsely populated than the Desert  In the 21  \fCHAPTER I  THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE I 95 1  remaining parts of the Western HimaJayan sub region there are 46 laldlS of people living on 258 lakhs of acres  The land area per cap ta is 560 cents  which is made up of 380 cents of n ountains  150 cents of hills  10 cents of plateaus and 20 cents of plains  The soils in the low lying plains are mostly alluvial  The texture classes are usually loams and clay 10ams while stiff day soils are also found in the valleys  On the biJIs  the surface and sub surface soils are stony and sandy  The average annual rainfal1 in Jammu and Kashmir is 39 inches  In the rest of the Western Himalayas  the average is 50 inches  the average number of rainy days being 70 to 75  Out of 258 lakhs of acres  exclusive of Jammu and Kashmir  134 lakhs fall in the dat k green belt and 89 lakhs in the light green belt  A small area of 35 lakhs falls in the blue belt  Village records are availahle for 282 Jakhs of acres out of 852  If we exclude Jammu and Kashmir  the net area sown per capica is 63 cents against a topographically usable area of 83 cents  Double cf lp percentage is high  24  5 per cent  as also irrigation  19 7 per cent   Fallow land is relatively small  10 8 per cent   Limestone and rocksalt are the only minerals which are worked  the former in the Himalayan foot hills of the Punjab and the laner in M mdi in Himachal Pradesh  Deposits of copper  gypsum  bauxite  bentonite and magnesite are known to exist but are not worked  33  EASTERN HIMALAYAS  This sub region includes the whole of Assam  Manipur  Tripura and Sikkim an d also three districts of West Bengal  Darjeeling  Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar   One hundred and twenty four lakhs of people live here on 674 lakhs of acres  the land area per capita is 542 cents which is much the same as in the Western Himalayas  exclusive of Jammu and Kashmir   Out of this total  I I4 cents are mountains  260 cents are hills  3 cents are plateaus and 165 cents are plains  The major part of the plains in this sub region is found in the Brahn aputra Valley whose al1uvial soils vary in colour from red to reddish brown  Other plain soils of Assam consist of red sand and loam types  In he hiils  some heavy clays are found  In Manipur  the red soils are deep and in Tripura red loarns  laterites  occur  The rainfall is abundant  and never failing  it is well over 75 inches in the year in most parts of the sub region  Owing to the peculiar configuration of the hills in relation to the rain bearing winds of the south west monsoon the amount of rainfall varies sharply frem pJace to place  Thus  Cherrapunji in the Khasi and Jaintia Hills receives the world record rainfall of 425 inches per year  while two stations in Nowgong district receive only 48 inches and 60 inches 1 2  \fLOW DENSITY SUB REGIONS  respectively  The average rainfall for the region as a whole is 108 inches and the number of rainy days is well over 100  Five hundred and seventy lakhs of acres out of 674 fall  therefore  in the blue belt and practically all the remaining land in the dark green belt  A small area of 3 lakhs in the Assam Hills appears to fall in the light green belt  Village records are available for 391 lakhs of acres out of 674  The net area sown per capita is 59 cents against a topographically usable area of 225 cents  Double crop is 14 per cent and irrigation 16  5  Fallow land is rather high  29  4 per cent   The area classed as forest is relatively small  between onesixth and one seventh  The percentage of unused land  48  3  is highest among all the sub regions of India  If these figures are compared with those of Western Himalayas  exclusive of Jammu and Kashmir  we arrive at the first indication ofrhe existence of some parts of India where a reserve of cultivable but uncultivated land is still available  This sub region contains the only petroleum field of India and it supplies 5 per cent of India s requirements  Coal is found in association with petroleum in Lakhimpur district at the eastern end of the Assam Valley  It is also found on the plateau in the Garo Hills and in the Khasi and Jaintia Hills district  Other minerals known to exist but not worked  are sillmanite in Gauhati and copper in Sikkim  34  NORTH WEST HILLS  The sub region is made up of the whole of Madhya Bharat except the three lowland districts  Bhind  Gird and~orena   and eight districts in south eastern Rajasthan  Udaipur  Dungarpur  Banswara Sirohi  Chittorgarh  Kotah  Bundi and Jhalawar   One hundred and four lakhs of people live on 4091akhs of acres  with a land area per capz ta of 394 cents  The sub region includes the Aravalli hill ranges which run from north east to the south west and form the north western boundary  It ac o includes the Vindhya and Satpura ranges running east to west  of which the latter forms the southern bOWldary  The composition of the land area per capita is 296 cents of plateaus  56 cents of hills and 42 cents of plains  The soils are mostly red and sandy  Medium black soils occur in Chittorgarh district and in Madhya Bharat Plateau  A mosaic of red and black soil is fOWld in the Madhya Bharat Hits division  The average rainfall is 35 inches  varying from 30 inches in the Rajasthan Hills to 37 inches in Madhya Bharat Plateau  The average number of rainy days varies from 34 in Rajasthan Hills to 44 in the Madhya llharat Hills  Out of 409 lakhs of acres  235 fall in the Jight green belt and 174 fall in the brown belt  Approximately 441akhs of people living in this sub region are exposed to the seasonal hazards of the brown belt  The net area sown per capita is 144 cents against a topographically usable area of 276 cents  Double crop and 23  \fCHAPTER 1   THE LAND AND nm  PEOPLE I951  iiTigation are relatively small  6 8 and 3 4 per cent respectively   There is very little fbrest  The unused land ratio is somewhat on the high side  25  5  per cent   The sub region is fairly rich in minerals  There are deposits of mica  lead  zinc  copper  sandstone and other building stones  fire clays and glass sands  India s principal deposits of lead and zinc are found in Zawar in Udaipur  Mewar   Production started during the war  was subsequently discontinued  and recently re commenced on a small scale  The sub region yields 10 per cent of the total annual output of Indian mica      35  NORTII CENTRAL HILLS AND PLATEAU  This sub region is made up of five districts oiUnar Pradesh Ohansi  Jalaun  Hr mirpur  B mda  and  Mirzapur   Vindhya Pradesh  Bhopal and seven north western districts of Madhya Pradesh  Mandla  Sagar  Jabalpur  Hcshangabad  Nimar  Betul and Chhindwara   One hundred and thirty eight lakhs of people live on 537 lakhs of acres  with a land area per capita of 389 cents  The sub region is traversed by a number of ranges running from south west to north east  In general  the higher elevation is found  in the south  and the land slopes gradually towards the north  The coinposition of the land area per capita is 226 cents of plateau land  70 cents of hills and 93 cents of plains  yielding a topographically usable area of 276 cents  There is a considerable area of black cotton soils in this sub region   Mixed red and black soils and red lateritic loams occur in Vindhya Pradesh and Bhopal    The rainfall conditions arc distinctly better than in the North West Hills  The general average is 44 inches ranging from 36 in the Uttar Pradesh districts to  48 inches in North West Madhya Pradesh and 49 inches in Bhopal  Out of 537 lakhs of acres  396 lakhs fall in the light green belt and 131 ltikhs in the dark  green belt  Only a small fringe of the land falls in the brown belt    The net area sown per  capita is 129 cents against the topographically usable area of 215 cents  Double crop is 10  8 per cent and irrigation 5 per cent  Fallow land is 18  8 per cent   There are extensive forests  lor lakhs of acres out of a dl Bsified total  of 526 lakhs of acres  The ratio of classified forests to total land area is large  the sub region ranks third highest in this respect  Malabar Konkan and the North East Plateau alone ranking higher   The ratio ofun used land is distinctly high  viz   28  I per cent  in fact  the sccr nd highest in Ii1 lia  the Eastern Himalayan sub region ranking first   In view of these·facts it is reasonable to suppose that the sub region contains reserves of CUltivable but uncultivated land  in a sense in which it cannot be said of any of the sub regions considered so far  except the Eastern Himalayas   The sub    region is also definitely rich in mineral resources  Deposits of coal  24   \fLOW DENSITY SUB REGIONS  manganese  graphite and fire clays arc found in North West Madhya Pradesh  Coal  in the Pench Valley field  and manganese  in the Chhindwara district  are the principal minerals which are worked in fair quantities  Coal is aL  o produced in the Vindhya Pradesh division of this sub region  where limestone is also workt d tor the manufacture of cement  Small quantities of diamonds are also found here  Deposits of bauxite are known to exist but are not worked  In the Uttar Pradesh districts of this sub region  glass sands are worked and  form the basis of the glass industry of that state  Limestone is also worked for the manufacture of cement   36  NORTH EAST PLATEAU  We now come to the last of our six low density sub regIOns  This is made up of three parts  the Chhota  Nagpur division of Bihar  the whole of Orissa except four districts  Balasorc~ Cunack  Puri and Ganjam Agency    and East 11 adhya Pradesh  that is to say  the dis    tricts of Balaghat  Bhandara  Chanda  Raipur  Bilaspur  Durg  Bastar  Raigarh and Surguja   Two hundred and ninety lakhs of people live on 9671akhs of acres  with a land area per capita of 333 cents  The Maikal range of the great Central Indian divide  runs through the north western part of this SUb region  The range is continued north eastwards as Korea hills and the divide ends at tl  e Parcshnath hills in Chhota Nagpur  The plateau lies generally at a high elcvation in the north  the height being about 2 000 4 000 feet above sea level  From the north the area generally slopes southwards or south eastwards  The remaining portion of the sub region is at a height of about 500 1 500 feet above sea level  The composition of the land area per capita is  therefore  125 cents of plateau land  110 cents of hills and 97 cents of plains  yielding a topographically usable area of 215 cents  In Chhota Nagpur the soils vary from red gravelly ferruginous to loams and clays  In East A1 2 dLsa PradcEh the soils are for the greater part typical black cotton type  Red yellow type recurs at the eastern end  The soils of the inland districts cf Orissa are mostly red earths with an occasional mixture of lateritic and black soils  Rainfall conditions are much bener here than even in the North Central Hills and Plateat s  The annual average is 56 inches ranging from 54 in Chhota Nagpur to 59 in Orissa Inland  The average number of rainy days varies from 63 in East Madhya Pradesh to 75 in Orissa Inland  Most pans of the subregion fall in the dark green belt and a relatively small area in the light green belt  The net area so  n per capita is 94 cents as against 2 I 5 cents which are topographically usable  Double crop is 14·4 per cent and irrigation 10·8 per cent  Fallow land is slightly on the high side  22·7 per cent   Out of the total area of 952  lS  \fCHAPTER I  THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE I951  lakhs of acres  village records are available for 771 lakhs of acres  They show that nearly 240 lakhs of acres are classified as forest  This is the largest area in any sub region of India  The proportion of clas~ified forests to total land area is also high  being in fact the second highest in India  Malabar Konkan is first   The unused land ratio is 23·3 per cent  These figures indicate that there is probably still some reserve of cultivable but uncultivated land  This sub regicn is distinguished from all others by its abundance of mineral wealth  One of the three divisions of this sub region  Chhota Nagpurproduces 82 per cent of India s coal  57 per cent of India s mica  46 per cent of Inrlia s iron ore  the entire output of India s copper ore  and fairly significant quantities of manganese  graphite  baUXite  lirr estcne and other minerals  Another division  East Madhya l n  desh  pHlduces 46 per cent of India s It is also known to have manganese and a little over 4 per cmt of India s coal  large deposits of jron ore and some bauxite  but these are not worked  A third division of this sub region  Orissa Inland  produces over one half of India s iron ore  one sixth of India s manganese and some coal also   37  ALL SIX SUB REGIONS  We rr ay now cGnsidcf all the six low density sub regions together and compare the conditions prevailing in that group with those of the country as a whole  The results are as follows  1  The total populatiC n of the six s uc regions is 792 lakhs against India s 3 613  21·9 per cent   The land area is  however  3 92 I lakhs of acres against India s 8 126  48 3 per cent   The land area per capita is 495 against India s 225  11  The topographical conditions which define the usabiJity ofland for cultivation purposes are dissimilar in the different sub regions  One sub region where topography is eminently favourable is largely unusable because of the desert  TABLE 8 A heavy write off is necessary in Percentage of cotal two others on account of mounland area tains  The other three arc mainly plateau land with a considerable Law density Topographical sub regions components India proportion of hilly tracts  The topographical components of land Plains 43 area per capita are

DENSITY SUB REGIONS  and Kashmir   The write off is 53 per cent against India s 34 per cent  On balance  it is clear that the topographical conditions are definitely less favourable  IlI   The distribution of land among the different rainfall belts in these six sub regions compares with Inrua as shown in TABLE 9· On the whole  it seems that rainfall conditions are somewhat more favourable here than in the country as a whole  The blue belt and the dark green telt are distinct ly T ABLE 9 larger but this might not make                                           Percentage of total much

Brown belt 7 24 brown belt  It is this which Ye ll lw belt 12 7 indicates that these sub regions are certainly not worse off and probably 100 100 slightly better off as regards rainfall than the country as a whole   The yellow belt ic   slightly large  but the effect of this factor has already been taken into account when the w   rst part of the desert was omitted from the reckoning   IV  The net area sown per capila is 96 cents as against India s 79 cents  It is difficult to say whether the advantage of the larger area is or is not offset by somewhat lower average of soil quality  It is probable there is some offsening  but it is not complete  The comparative figures of land use are shown below  TABLE 10  Low density Indices of land use    Peroentage of net    8 sown to totall nd are

LAND AND THE PEOPLE I951  It should be noted particularly that the proportion of net area sown to the topographically usable area is significantly smaller and the unused land ratio is significantly higher  From this it would follow that the low density is not entirely a matter of the available resources being peorer  Such a statement would be certainly true of the Desert  probably also of the North West H ills and possibly the Western H imalayas  The Eastern Himalayas  the North East Plateau and the North Central Hills and Plateau sub regions fall in a different category  It seems probable  as already n enticncd  that they contain some reserve of cultivable but uncultivated land  What is perhaps even more significant is the fact that these wbregions and more especially the last two among them possess mineral resources c  a distinctly higher range and   alue than anywhere else in India    Tcday  that fact seems to have very little influence on the relative distribution of people on the land  But it might well make a difference in the future  when the possibilities of industrial development    so clearly indicated by these resourccs  are more fully utilised   E~ Medium Density

Bhilwara  Jhunjhunu   and  vi  Ajmer  Two hundred and fifty nine lakhs of people live here on 499 lakhs of acres with a land area per capita of 193 cents  The entire sub region lies between about 600 1 500 feet above sea level except in the southwest where a part of the Aravalli ranges enters into Ajmer division    The composition of the land area per capita is  therefore  124 cents of plains  61 cents of  plateaus and 8 cents of hills  yielding 110 cents as the topographically usable area  The Punjab Plain consists mostly of alluvium of the same origin as in the Gangetic plains  generally sandy loam  Mixture of alluvial and aeolian soils cover Delhi  East Rajasthan  Patiala and East Punjab States Union and the lowland districts of Madhya Bharat  To the scuth and east of Jaipur  th~ soils are either black cotton or a rich alJuvialloam  In Ajmer the soils are mostly sandy  We have already seen how average annual rainfall diminishes sharply we move westward up the Gangetic plains  When we reach the Trans Gangetic Plain the amount becomes quite small  The average ranges from 19 inches in Patiala and East Punjab States Union to 28 inches in Madhya Bharat Lowland The average number of rainy days ranges from 26 in Ajmer to 36 in Madhya Bbarat Lowland  Out of a total of 499 lakhs of acres  only 26 lakhs lie in the light green belt  Four hundred and twelve lakhs of acres lie in the brown belt and 61 lakhs in the yellow belt  A large part of the sub region is  therefore   exposed to the hazards of drought  Part of the affected area is  however  protected by irrigation   as  The net area sown per capita is 95 cents against the topographically usable area of IIO cents  Double crop is fairly high  19 per cent  and irrigation is distinctly high  28 per cent    The sub

distinctly small  13 9 per cent    As in the Gangetic plains  mineral resources are unimportant  Some limestone is produced in the foot hills of the Himalayas and there is some mica production in Ajmer  40   SOUTH DECCAN  This sub region consists of four divisions   viz   Mysore  Madras Deccan  South Hyderabad  and Bombay DeccanSouthem  The Madras districts are  Bel1ary  Anantapur  Cuddapah

lakhs of people live on 817 lakhs of acres with a a land area of 259 cents per capita  The composition oftbis area is 175 cents of plateaus  41 cents of hills and 43 cents of plains  thus yielding 183 cents as the topographically usable area  In the districts of South Hyderabad and Bombay Deccan Southern the land is covered by medium black soils  red loams and lateritic soils  In Mysore  the soils are predominantly red sand loam type  In the four districts of Madras Deccan  black cotton soils are associated with red loams and sandy loams  The average rainfall is 32 inches ranging from 24 inches in the Madras Deccan to 35 inches in Hyderabad and 36 inches in Mysore  The average number of rainy days is 39 in Madras Deccan and 56 in Mysore  Approximately 277 lakhs of acres out of 817 fall in the light green belt  Nearly twice that area or 520 lakhs of acres fall in the brown belt  Some parts of the areanotably the districts of Madras and Bombay   are especially exposed to the hazards of drought  Rainfall is not only scanty but capricious  and  in consequence  severe scarcities and famines occur  not merely frequently  but more or less regularly  The net area sown per capita is II4

large deposits of high quality iron ore but production is small because there is no coal field in the vicinity  Magnesite and chromite arc other minerals produced in Mysor~  Manganese is worked in Madras Deccan  Iron ore  limestone  gold and asbestos are known to exist in this area  though not worked  Small quantities of bauxite are produced in Bombay Deccan Southern division  41  NORTH DECCAN  There are three divisions in this sub region  viz   South West Madhya Pradesh  North Hyderabad and Bombay Deccan Northern  Amraoti  Buldana  Akola  Yeotmal  Wardha and Nagpur are the Madhya  30

Parbhani  Nanded  Bidar  Brur and Osmanabad are the Hyderabad districts  Two hundred and thirty nine lakhs of people live on 621 lakhs of acres with an average land area per capita of 260 cents  The sub region is bounded on the north by the Satpuras and on the west by the Western Ghats  The land generally slopes from west to east except in the north where the river Tapti  flowing westward  enters the Arabian Sea  The land area per capita is composed of 184 cents of plateaus  46 cents of hills and 30 cents of plains  yielding 214 cents as topographically usable area  Heavy black cotton soils occur in South West Madhya Pradesh and North Hyderabad  The rest of the sub region contains medium black soils with a fairly considerable area carrying red loam  lateritic  soils  Except in the narrow strip near the ghats  the major portion of this sub region lies in the rain shadow of the Western Ghats  and the rainfall is therefore low  The general rainfall is 36 inches and varies from 30 inches to 37 inches in Bombay Deccan Northern  The average number of rainy days ranges from 44 to 50  Approximately 303 lakhs of acres out of 621 lakhs fall in the light green belt and 275 lakhs fall in the brown belt  This part of the sub region is exposed to hazards of drought  though not so severely as parts of South Deccan  The net area sown per capita is 157 cents as against 214 cents of to pographically usable area  Double crop is negligible  1  9 per cent  and the irrigation percentage is exceedingly smaJI  4 2   Fallow land is 25 per cent  The forest area is small and the unused land ratio is extraordinarily small  2 6 per cent  which is the lowest ratio among all the sub regions in India   This sub region is perhaps the poorest in mineral resources  poorer even than the Northern Plains  This is because the sub region is covered  for the most part  by volcanic lavas  Situated just outside the lava tracts  there is a manganese field in Nagpur district of Madhya Pradesh  which is an outlier of the main fields of Balaghat and Bhandara districts to the east  42  GUJRAT KATHIAWAR  This sub region consists of Kutch  Saurashtra and the districts of Bombay to the north of the Daman Ganga river  viz  Banaskantha  Sabarkantha  Mehsana  Ahmedabad  Kaira  Panch Mahals  Baroda  Broach  Surat and Amreli   The north eastern tracts of the sub region consist of portions of the Satpuras  the Vindhyas and the Gujrat Malwa hill ranges  They focus the drainage of the eastern part of this sub region on to the Gulf of Cambay by a fan of major rivers of which the most famous are the Narbada and the Tapti  One hundred and sixty one h khs of people live here on 4561~  31  \ftUAPtER t  11tE LANb AND TltE P£oP1  ~ 195t  of acres of land with a land area per capita of 283 cents  This is composed of 255 cents of plains  27 cents of hills and one cent of plateau  The plains   how ever  include 75 lakhs of acres of purely nominal land  mostly marshy wastes  which includes 59 Jakhs of acres in the Rann of Kutch  If this is alm written off along with the normal percentages of the different topographical ccmponents  the topographically usable area per capita is 207 cents  The sub region consists of deep black and medium black and alluvial soils  Patches of mixed red and black soils and lateritics also occur  Ninety per cent of the rainfall occurs during the monsoon season  June to September  The southern Gujrat plain and the Tapti Valley receive a moderate rainfall of 30 inches to 40 in  hcs  which increases further towards the Satpuras and the north eastern highlands  Further north in Gujrat  there is a steady decline from 40 inches to 25 inches  There is a steep fall along the Saurashtra coast  and Kutch is semi desert  The sub region enjoys a curious distinction  It is the only subregion which has some part of its land in all the five rainfall belts  The total land area  456 lakhs of acres  is distributed as follows  blue belt  4   dark green belt  17   light green belt  107   brown belt  247   and the yellow belt  81   The net area sown per capita is 129 cents against the topographically usable area of 207 cents  Double crop and irrigation are ve ry small  3  7 per cent and 3·9 per cent respectively   Fallow land is 20· 5 per ctnt  l~ orests are negligible  The lU1used hmd ratio is much the same as in the Upper G~l11getic   Plains  14· 5 per cent   Manganese is worked in the Panch Mahals district of Bombay  Other minerals known in the sub region are gypsum  bauxite and limestone  Salt is made all along the coast  and the output is very large  nearly one half of the total production of the country  43  ALL FOUR SUB REGIONS  Considering all four medium density subregions together  the results are as follows   1  The total population of the four sub regions is 974 lakhs against India s 3 613 lakhs  or 27 0 per cent   The land area is 2 393 lakhs of acres against India s 8 126  or 29  4 per cent   The land area per

     II  100  100     From the point of view of topography  the medium density sub·reglons are perhaps slightly better off than the country ~ a whole  As compared with the total land area of 246 cents  the  topographically usable area is  174 cents  The write off is only 29 per cent against 34 per cent for the  country as a whole   111  But this advantage is heavily offset partly because the soil is  on the average  poorer  and even more  because the rainfall is much more unfavourable  This is seen from TABLE 13  The brown belt dominates Sixty·one per cent of the land in Percentage of total

even greater  on these medium density sub regions than in the high density sub regions  Though the rainfall is scanty  it is flot so small as to forbid cultivation altogether as in the Desert  So  the people have settled and grown in numbers   But the capriciousness of the rainfall and other difficulties of cultivation seem  on ly to provide the people with a strong incentive for attempting cultivation over as large an area as possible    I    The fact that the fallow percentage is higher than the average for India not only does not contradict these conclusions   but rather tends to confirm them  Extension of cultivation over sub marginal land of low productivity must necessarily entail a higher fa1l~w percentage   F   India and the World in the last three sections how the distribution of the people on the land  measured by our chosen index  the land area per capitavaries from one SUb region to another  It stands to reason that there must be a fairly close connection between the siZ  ~ of the index and the usefulness of land to provide the food needed by the people who live on it  And we have found  by reference to the simplest of known facts about the topography  nature of soil  34 WE HAVE SEEN  \fINDIA AND THE WORLI   the aDlOWlt of rainfall   and the nature of land use  that the figures d   bang together  Without attempting anything in the nature of  a mathematical oorrelation  and the data at our disposal are hardly suitable for that PUPQSewe can ~ve how in sOItle areas the people can and do live on less land per bead than elseWhere  45  We have indeed been led beyond this point to the conception of different· degrees of utilisation of usable resources  We noticed the apparently ariamo10us  but  neVertheless  credible  circumstance that the people living in the ~ medium density sub regions with apparently more abundant land than in the high density sub regions have in fact had to contend agSinst greater diffi    cuIties and exerted themselves more and achieved an even higher degree of utilisation of usable land     At this stage  it is appropriate that we should carry our review from within our country to the world as a whole  and attempt to form an idea of our   own posi~ion in the distribution of humanity over the land area of the world  46  The following table shows the basic facts of comparison between India and the World   TABLE 15  India  World  36 81  240 3 251    All land  225  1 354  Agricultural area •  97  351  Arable land  97  126  Population  IN CRORES  Land area  IN CRORES OF ACRES  • Area per capita  IN CENTS     Humanity consists of not less than six and not more than seven persons for every person living in India  But the total land area of all the countries of the world is well over forty times as extensive as India  So  the land which would fall to the share of each of us  if the entire world were evenly divided  would measure 131   a acres  or an area which is six times as large as our own land area per capita  In that event  would we be six times as well off as at present   That  se6ms hardly likely  if we look at  the figures  of agriculmral area  and IIlO11   partiCularly ~arable land          ~   \fCHAPTER I   tilE LAND  AN   THE PEOPLE I95 t     47   The foregoing figures have been taken from the YearBook of Food and  Agricultural Statistics issued by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the  United Nations  What is referred to here as  arable land  should be deemed   to include not only all land actually used for growing food or other crops   which is what we have hitherto considered as  net area sown   but also fallow   lands    Agricultural area  according to these publications includes all such land and in addition  what are called  permanent meadows and pastures   We have apparently got no land of this distinctive description   our equivalent of such   land is included within our total of  net area sown  and  fallow land   It appears that the average citizen of the world uses only a quarter of the land on which he lives as  agricultural area   and he uses only about a third of this agricultural area as crop land and fallow  On the other hand  we use over twofifths of the entire land on which we live for  agricultural  purposes and we cultivate almost all of it  In the result  the world citizen cultivates 126 cents against our 97 cents  The difference between the areas which are cultivated is already very much less than the difference between the areas which are available  What is the explanation for this  One explanation may be that our land area per capita includes a somewhat higher proportion of the more productive land  Another may be that we are over crowded on too little land and are  therefore  unable to pick and choose and have been already compelled to bring under cultivation a good deal of poor land which the average world citizen leaves waste or uses for rough grazing  It may be that the true explanation consists in part of both  Here we are faced wi~h m1   ch the same questions with which we started when we observed the ineqUality of distribution of people on the land in different zones within India itself   48  It is not very eaSy to answer the questions firmly  ·because we are even less certain about the relevant facts of other countries than we are of different parts of our own  So far as topography is concerned  it does not appear that the average Indian citizen is better off than the average world citizen  It is reckoned that the world consists of  12 per cent of mountains  I4 per cent of bills  33 per cent of plateaus and 41 per cent of plains  Our country consists of   11 per cent of mOWltains I8 per cent of hills  28 per cent of plateaus and 43 per cent of plains  The write off  purely on account of topography  is much the same  It seems likely  however  that the proportion of land which 1has to be written off as arid or frozen land is somewhat smaller in India  than the world ~ 8  whole     36   in  \fiNDIA ANt  THE· woIUJ      49  While we cannot be sure whether or not the average land of the world is better or worse fitted for cultivation than our land  it is fairly cert~ that the average land of Europe is definitely better fitted  Europe has fewer land· forms· that curtail food production  than other continents  EW Ope   has also got  the highest proportion of well watered land   Not only is rainfall both adequate and reliable  the rains are gentle and the temperatW e moderatethe soils are not leached by heavy rains that wash out most of the fertility  The table below shows the comparison between India and Europe   TABLE 16  Europa  EXCLUSIVE OF EUROPJiAN  India Population  IN CRORES    U S S R    39 6     Land area  IN CRORES OF ACRES

Europe  which is the most densely populated continent of the fJ urld  is less densely populated than India  The average European has more land per capita than the average Indian  the excess held by the former is well over a third of all the land held by the latter  Secondly   The average European has brought only 30 per cent of his land under the plough    The average Indian  on the other hand  has brought under the plough 43 per cent of his land  even though it has a far larger proportion of thin and poor soils  and a les s adequate and less evenly distributed r~fall   · Only thus is the average Indian able to get 97 cents of cultivated and fallow · fields  agaiIist 92 cents of the average Europe~     • The exact proportion of Euiopeanland     aunt I oj European U S S R  which should

37  \fCHAPTER I   tHE LAND AND ·THE PEOPLE I951  Thirdly   Because he has got· more and better land and has usea  only a S1IfGller frat tion alit for culti Dation  the aoerage European is able to Moe  and does  haw  n addition  61 cents of agricultural land under  jJemfan8nt meadOtlJs and pastures·     These are important facts  They have a direct bearing on the issue much debated these  days  whether the problem in India is one of  over population  or  under development    and whether food is short because there is not enough land or because  of the alleged  inefficiency  and  archaic methods  of Indian farming  Whether or not the assumption be true that the methods of Indian fanning are  archaic  or  inefficient   no such assumption is necessary for explaining the difference in the nutritional standard of the average European and the average Indian  Even in the absence of any difference in farming efficiency  Europe can produce more plant food per capita than India because much the same area of arable land per capita is available in Europe as in India but with more favourable rainfall and soil conditions  In addition  Europe has got  permanent meadows and pastures  which must  provide a supply of milk  milk products  beef  mutton and other foodstuffs of animal origin   for which there can be no parallel in India  Thus out of his own resources  the average European can produce not merely more food than the average Indian   this he needs  in any event  because of the climate  but also better food  richer  better balanced  and more nutritious food  Actually  the average European consumes more food than his land produces  He has IIUlIlageq to do this with the help of overseas imports of food  of the order of about one fifths of his total  consumption    50  This comparison between India and Europe  on this fundamental issue ~aftbe reJau9nship between the land and the people  is so important that we might  dwell a little longer on it and carry the analysis a stage further    There are  of course  many countries Europe  and conditions differ from one to the other  in much the same way as we have seen that they differ from one sub regioo to another in India  We may institute a closer comparison between India and Europe by considering groups of European countries which might correspond to our high density sub regions and low density sub regions separately  The United Kingdom  Frana   Gennany  Belgium  Netherlands and · Luxemburg form a group of European countries  call this GToup A · which has almost exactly the same population as our five high density sub regions  viz   the Lower Gangetic Plains  the Upper Gangetic Plajns  Malabar Konkan  South Mad r~ and North Madras   Orissa Coastal  Another group of Eur~ countries  let us call it Group B  consisting of Greece  Bulgaria  Yugoslavia   in  J8  \fINDIA ~AND 11m WORLD   Albania  Spain  Ireland  Norway  Sweden and Finland contain almost exactly the same population as our six low density sub regions   liz  the Desert  Westem HimalaYas   Eastem Himalayas  North West Hills  North Central Hills Plateau  and North East Plateau  The two sets of territories are compared in the ta le below     TABLE It ·  High deMIY  sub regions of India   European l4u countn es  density of sub regions    Group A of India  European coUntries   of  Group B  Population  IN

validity about each of the two groups of European countries and their counterpart sub regions of India separately  In the face of these figures there can be no reasonable doubt that  in relation to the natural resources available for the production of food  India is even more heavily over populated than Europe  51  We may now conclude this review with a brief glance at two great countries  the United States of America and the Soviet Union  where the relationship between the land and the people is incomparably more favourable  The total number of people living in both these countries put together is slightly smaller than the total number of the people of India  But the land area of these two cOWltries is far more than nine times as large and not far short of ten times as large as India  The basic facts of the comparison are given in TABLE 18 on next page   39  \ftitAPTER I    Tim L1Jtt  ~i  TItE PEOPLE 19$t  TABLE 18  Population  IN CRORES      Land area  rN CRORBS OF ACRES

tell their own story  It is true that the Soviet Union and even the United States of America have a clearly larger proportion of arid and frozen lands than Europe or even India  We have no information  of   a precise and quantitative character which can help us to make the correct allowance for the overall differences in topography  climate arid soil  Even so  the observed differences in per capita availability of all land  agricultural area  and arable land are so large that they cannot be attributed entirely or even in large measure to soH differences  The outstanding fact must be recognised  the peoples of the United States of America and Soviet Russia have at their disposal a definitely larger share of the· usable land of the World than the peoples of Europe and India   \fCHAPTER II  The Pattern of Living I 95 I A   Villages and Towns  A  for the census count were made village by village and town by town  We have thus got a count of all the different places where people live  The total number of such places is 56r r07  558 089 villages and 3 018 towns  Out of3 569 lakhs of people whom we counted  2 950 laths were found in villages and 619 lakhs in towns  RRANGEMENTS  2  Let us suppose that the entire country is divided by lines dr~wn fr  m north to south at regular intervals of five miles and by other lines drawn from east to west similarly at regular intervals of five miles  Then  the entire territory over which the census was taken would be divided into 47 074 squares  each of which will be five miles long and five miles broad  Let us refer to the villages falling within each of these squares as a  village group   We shall then have 558 089 census villages combined into 47 074  village groups   An average Indian  village group  will consist  in round figures  of a dozen villages  each with rather more than 500 inhabitants  There will be rather more than six thousand villagers in all in each  village group    3  The following table shows how this pattern of  village groups  differs in different zones   TABLE I  Average number oj viUagers per village  Zone North India East India South India   West India   Central India North·West India       INDIA  489

zone with the Smallest proportion of town dwellers  The average for West Bengal Plain is as high as 26  I  because of Greater Calcutta  But the zonal average is low because it includes the very large population of Bihar  with only  6  7 per cent in towns   Orissa  with 4  I per cent  and Assam  with 4 6 per cent   In West India  on the other band  consistently high ratios are found in different parts of the zone  The urban population ratio is 33  7 per cent in Saurashtra 26  5 per cent and 26 2 per cent in the Northern and Southem divisions of Bombay Deccan and 25 6 per cent in Bombay Gujrat   Within the limits of one state  Madhya Pradesh    we have such large variations as 26  I per cent in the SouthWest Madhya Pradesh division  15 3 per cent in the North West Madhya Pradesh division and 5 7 per cent in the East Madhya Pradesh division  The growth of towns has largely depended  at any rate in the past  on the accidents of history and geography  There is  therefore  no particular order or system observable in their distribution  7  Towns vary in number of inhabitants even more widely than villages  We may adopt a simple four fold classification and refer to all towns with a population of one lakh and over as  cities   those with a population range of 20 000 to a lakh as  major Number U7 ban of popula  towns   those with a population ·range of 5 000 to 20 000 as  minor

Cities  MajortoWDS  186  M iaor towns  30  I  in TABLH 3   8  The question arises     if 3  3 there are  very large villages  619 100 0 with more than 5 000 inhabitants in each  how are they distinguished from minor to WllS which might also have the same number and more particularly  how are villages distinguished from the townships wbich have a smaller population than even 5 000  The answer is that a hard and fast line is very difficult   to draw    Some criteria were laid down and the towns were specified at· the early   censuses  These aiteria are reapplied at every census and additions and alterations ve Townshipa •  6Z2  20  \fc  VILLAGES AND TOWNS    made to the lists of towns  in each state  GeneraBy speaking  it is much more oommon at each successive  rensus for villages to be reclassified as towns  than the other way about     9  The tests prescribed for distinguishing towns from villages in different states are based on ideas common to all states  but they are not identical nor  have they been applied with meticulous uniformity  Thus  Uttar Pradesh classifies as a town    a  every Municipality   b  every notified area   c  every town area   tf  cantonment and  e  any other continuous group of houses permanently inhabited by usually not less than 5 000 persons which  having regard to the character of the population  the relative density of the dwellings  the importance of the place as a centre of trade and its historic associations   the State Superintendent of Census Operations decided to treat as a Census Town   In West Bengal  the definition is somewhat stricter  There  a town is    a  an area  irrespective of population  which has been declared by the Government to be a municipality  and  b  where a municipality has not been established and yet the Government decides to call it a town for the ensuing census  if the area has satisfied the following tests    I  it has a population of not less than 5 000   it  a density of not less than 1 000 inhabitants to the square mile   t it  the area has some importance as a centre of trade or distribution or administration  and  iv  about three quarters of the adult male population are chiefly employed in pursuits other than agriculture    The fundamental criterion  in Madras is reported to be  the existence of urban features  which can be judged by the way in which the houses are situated and how they have been built and the availability of urban amenities  such as a bazar where one could buy one s normal requirements throughout the year  facilities for education  recreation and medical treatment    The percentage of urban population living in townships reflects  to some extent  the differences in these definitions  It ranges from 6  2 per cent in North India to 1 3 per cent in East India  The other zones  in order  are  NorthWest India  5 9   Central India  4  6   South India  2·0   and West India  1 9   10  It is possible that places which would have been classified as villages in one state may be classified as towns in others  But the proportion of the urban population living in such places is very small  If we neglect the figures for townships  there is little doubt  the numbers of minor towns  major towns and cities and the statistics of inhabi tants  of such towns do present a comparable picture of the pattern of urban life i~

shall see presently  the numPer of agricultural rentiers living in villages as well as towns is a very much smaller fraction of the total number of all agriculturists in the country  Cultivation i$ carried on in the periphery of all towns  Some cultivators and even cultivating labourers live there  The proportion of such people is very small in the cities and maJor towns  but is quite considerable in the minor towns and townships  6  Let us leave the non agriculturists for a time  and follow up our 7 10 lakhs of agriculturists  They are divided into four classes as below  TABLE 5

IV  whom we shall refer to as  agricultural rentiers  for short  is numerically insignific  ant  This class includes two quite different types of people referred to as  non cuItivating owners  of land  and  other agricultural rent receivers   In popular imagination  the  proprietors of zamindaris and other estates come first  They are the people referred to to as  other agricultural rent receivers   This is a better description of such people than  non cultivating owners of land   because their legal rights over the whole or greater part of the cultivated land in the estate are strictly limited to the receipt of a rent  which may not changed except by 93  be  \fHOUSES AND HOUSEHOLDS  data  though collected on the all India basis were not compiled  In view of this snd the difficulty already mentioned about West Bengal s definition of a  house   the figures for Ea India are not referred to in this section for purposes of comparison with other zones  16  Houses and households  There arc  to begin with  112 households in every 100 hou   es of a typical Indian village and 124 households in every 100 houses of a typical Indian town  Familie~ occupying the same house but living and messing separately in different parts of that house  which are not struc~ turally separated from one another and provided with separate main entrances  are thus more common in the town than in the village  the difference being represented by 12 per cent in the village and 24 per cent in the town   17  Number of persons in households  In every hWldred households in the village there are 491 persons  in every hundred households in the town  the number is 471  The difference  though small  is probably not insignificant  18  Number of persons in houses  If we combine the two foregoing sets of data it may be infr~rred that in every hWldred houses in a vHlage 550 people must be living  while in every hundred houses of a town 584 people must be living  These figures arc somewhat smaller than one would get if the entire rural population of 2 950 lakhs and the entire urban popUlation of 619 lakhs were divided up among the occupied houses mentioned in para 12  viz   541 lakhs of houses in vmages and 103 lakhs of houses in towns   There are two reasons for this  One is that the household data are based on a sample and a sampling error is unavoidable  Another  and probably the more important  reason is that the sample household data are exclusive of people living in boarding houses  hostels  hospitals  jails and other institutions as well as of people living in camps  members of wandering tribes and other homeless persons  19  Males and females  Out of 491 people in every hundred nu a  households  252 are males and 239 are females there is a male excess numbering 13  in  100  households   Out of 471 people in every hundred urban households  248 are males and 223 are femalcs  there is a male excess numbering 25 in 100 households  It should be noted that there is a male ex~ss both in the village and in the town  the excess is  however  larger in the t  WIl than in the village   Types of households  differentialed by size    Let us refer to a household whi~ has three

seems a little surprising that every third household in a village should be a  small household  with three members or less  Such a large proportion of small households is a prima facie indication that families do not continue to be  joint  according to the tradtitional custom of the country and the habit of breaking away from the joint family and Setting up separate households is quite strong  Unfortunately we do not have Similar information for past censuses  So  we cannot say whether th~ per centage of   small households  has or has not been increasing and we cannot measure the differences in the rate of change in different parts of the country  Information has been collected and compiled about the pattern of household relationship  This is available for households in general  but not separately for rural and urban households  If we consider 100 households  taken proportionately from villages as well as towns  there are 487 persons in them and their household relationship is as shown below  21   TABLE  7 Number in 100 households  Household relations  p Heads of households      A    Male  married    Male  widowers   Females  Wives of heads of households   •

number of households living in every 100 houses of a village varies from 108 in West India to 1I8 in North India  The intermediate figures are 109 in Central India  I I I in South India and 113 in North West India  22   In every zone  the number of households per 100 houses is larger in the town than in the Village  The excess is almost negligible in North West India  In other zones it ranges from 5 per 100 houses in Central India to 10 in West India  13 in North India and 24 in South India  23  The total number of members of 100 rural households ranges from 473 jn Central India to 5II in North West India as well as North India  It is 483 in South India and 500 in West India  There is practically no difference in the number of members of rural households and urban households in South India  In other zones the number is smaller in urban households   24  There is an excess of males over females both in the village and the  town in every zone  The difference is negligible in South India  but very conspicuous in North West India and North India  The excess is  Sl  \fCHAPTER II   TRE PAT ffiRN OF LIVING I951  larger in the towns than in the villages  in all zones exee pt one  are

100 Urban that the size pattern of rural as Zone households households well as urban households                                 presented two main features North India 27 46 7 in the country as a

or INDIA 13 25 less  are more numerous than large ~md very large households with 7 or more members  This table shows that these two generalisations are true of every zone  A review 0f data relating to the states and divisions of a state within each zone shows that these features are observable everywhere except in six divisions  viz   West Madras  Travancore Cochin  Coorg  Vindhya Pradesh  Patiala   East Punjab States Union and Sikkim  It is only in the rural areas of these six divisions that one finds the small household to be less numerous than large and very large households  TABLE 8  TABLE 9

West India and West India and 175 in South India  We may deduce from these figures that the number of widowers who are heads of households must be 33 in North India  30 in North West India and West India  29 in South India and 25 in Central India  Female head i of households are fewest in North India and Central India  7 per hundred households  and largest in South India  14   Other figures are  8 in North West India and II in West India   27  Sons and daughters of heads of households  The total number of sons in 100 households varies from  03 in Central India to 1I6 in North West India  In other zones the number is   105 in North India  110 in West India and I I I in South India  Sons outnumber daughters in every zone  The difference is largest  34  in North West India and North India and smallest  22  in South India  The differences in the other zones are  30 in West India and 28 in Central India   28  Persons related to the head of the household  other than sons and daughters    The total number of such persons in 100 households is largest in North India  137  and smallest in South India  109   Elsewhere  it ranges as follows  132 in North West India  and II9 in West India and Central India  In every zone  female relatives  other than daughters  outnumber the male relatives  other than sons    29  Persons unrelated to the head of the household  The number per 100 households is smallest in North West India  l   and largest in North India  13   For other zones the figures are  7 in West India  5 in South India and 4 in Central India   30  This completes our accowlt of the internal structure of the household based on a very brief review of sample households as recorded in the National Register of Citizens  It should be emphasized that the figures given in this Section are baSed on sample households taken from the National Register of Citizens and that there are no similar figures of prior censuses with which to compare them  They give a broad picture which is probably reliable  Much closer study  supplemented by local enquiries  is necessary before one can analyse the similarities and differences disclosed by this review and correlate  53  \fCHAPTER If   THE PATTERN OF LIVING   951  them with the similarities and differences independently ascertained to exist in ~espect of social habits and customs in different parts of the country  Only then we shall be able to appreciate the full significance of the data and form a clear mental picture of the pattern of household life in all parts of the country   C   Sex Ratio IT IS PERHAPS natural that people should expect to find that males and females are equal in number everywhere and at all times  Some surpri~e is always expressed when the census figures show the contrary  The census figures show not only that males and females are unequal in numbers but also that the magnitude of this inequality is also different in different parts of the country  The difference between the numbers of the two sexes is negligible or relatively small in some parts of the country and quite substantial in ot hers The difference tende  to get larger from one census to another at some places  it tends to get smaller elsewhere   32  It is usual to measure the difference in numbers between the sexes by an index number called the sex ratio   In the United Kingdom  the number of females per 1000 males  is used as the index number  In the United States of America  the number of males per hundred females  is used for the same purpose  The Census of India is used to the former and we shall therefore refer to the  number of females per 1000 males  as the sex ratio  33  In the country as a whole  the sex ratio was 947  according to the 1951 Census  It varied widely among the zones  The lowest value was 883 in North West India  The highest value was 999 in South India where practical equality of the sexes was attained  The other four zones varied thus  910 in North India  938 in West India  945 in East India and 973 in Central India  34  The sex ratio was found to be Jess than 1000 in every division of North India and North West India without any exception  In the other four zones  it is possible to locate divisions where the females outnumber males  Such divisions are specified in TABLE 10 on opposite page  together with their sex ratio   54  \fSEX RATIO TABU

than in villages  For the country as a whole  the sex ratio in villages is 966  while that in towns is 860  The sex ratio in villages is lowest in North West India  895   In the villages of South India  females outnumber males  the sex ratio is 1004  In other zones  the rural sex ratio varies thus  92 5 in North India  977 in East India  979 in Central India and 987 in West India  The urban sex ratio is lowest in East India  719  reflecting the deeply disturbing influence of Greater Calcutta  The urban sex ratio is highest in South India  977   It varies in other zones as follows   820 in North India  838 in West India  843 in North West India and 939 in Central India  The difference between the rural sex ratio and the urban sex ratio is very large in East India  258   It is smallest in South India  27   In other zones it varies from 40 in Central India to 52 in North West India and lOS in North India to 149 in West India  36  The low sex ratio of towns is further emphasized if the ratio is computed separately for cities  that is to say  towns with a population of one lakh and over  In the country as a whole  as mentioned already  there are 235 Jakhs of people living in cities  of whom 132 lakhs are males and 103 lakhs are females  The sex ratio for all cities of India is 787  It is lowest for East India  641  and  55  \fCHAPteR tI   rItE PAtmaN OF LtvtNG

these differences in numbers bet wee n males and 989 764 females really true  or are they 883 merely errors in countjng   Some 699 50 years ago  scholars of western 833 Europe  who studied the results of 78 3 the Indian Censuses  took the view that the figures could not be correct  They were accustomed to an excess of females over males in western Europe and thought that a large difference in sex ratio between India and western Europe was unnatural  A number of consjderations   it seemed to thcm  supported their conclusion  The author of the I91I Census Report summarised these considerations as follows  75 0   It is well known that the natives ofIndia are reticent regarding their women and that in some parts women urc regarded as of very little account  It is  therefore  natural to suppose that the return of them at the Census should be incomplete  The age statistics show that the proportion of females is lowest between the ages 10 and 20  This is the time of life when it might be supposed that there would be a tendency to conceal the existence of unmarried females  The increasing accuracy of each succeeding census has been accompanied by a rise in the proportion of females  It is only reasonable to suppose that there is a connection between the two phenomena  The vital stathtics for the decade 1891 1900 disclosed a relatively low female mortality and in this respect they were confirmed by the mortality rates deduced from the age return of the last Census    3S  A reasoned refutation of all these arguments is furnished at some length jn the 19II Census Report  The main point was that if the female deficiency was due to omissions  then omissions must be of the order of 9 per cent which   in view of the arrangements which had been perfected by 1911  was  56  \f§Ek iui t6 altogether out of the question  The tbeory of omissions was also contradicted by internal evidence    The Census staff being more largely composed of permanent officials  was more efficient in the Punjab than in most other parts of India  but it is here that the deficiency of females is most marked     If reticence  regarding women had any effect  it would reduce the proportions for Muhamedens more than those for Hindus but in almost i all parts of India the proportion offemales among the adherents of that religion is relatively high       In the Punjab  where the general proportion is very low  it is lowest among the Sikhs  who on the whole  are least reluctant to talk about their women       There is a difference of more than a hundred in the proportions per mille between two of the natural divisions in the Madras Presidency although women hold exactly the same position in both  The animistic tribes neither scorn nor seclude their women  but there are extraordinary differences among such tribes in different parts of India  IJ  The reality of female deficiency  where this is shown by census figures to be very pronounced  was also independently attested by certain social conditions which were known to exist  such as the very high bride prices which are com  monIY pal d        39  In 1911 it was necessary to establish the reality of female defidency in India by elaborate arguments  This is no longer necessary for two reasons  First   Successive censuses have since repeated and confirmed the pattern of difference in the sex ratio  This is seen from the following table TABLE 12  Sex  ratiQ   GENERAL POPULA1ION PER 1000 MALES  r    ~               A ~         ~  Zone  19 Jl  J   H  19·1   19 j1  North India  909 986  90 4  90 7  910  967  95 1  945

arrried out an actual verification of the 1951 Census COWlt  organised on a random sample basis throughout most parts of the country  57  \fCHAPTER It   tHE PAtTERN OF  LlVING  1951  We know not only that the people who were omitted from the count were relatively few  we know with reasonable certainty what proportion of the population taey actually were  We also know the sex ratio of the people who were ascertained  by verification  to have been omitted  It is true that among those who were omitted  there were more females than males in all zones  with the exception of Central India where there were a few more males than females   But we know what the differences were  We can calculate  from the ascertained figures  that if allowance were made for the omission  the sex ratio for India should be 949 instead of 947  1001 instead of 999 in South India  and 885 instead of 883 in North West India  The difference involved in making or not making an allowance for omissions is thus altogether negligible  We may proceed on the basis that the numbers of the sexes do  in fact  differ in the manner indicated by the published census figures   40  In recent years  figures have been furnished for a great many countries of the world  There are  however  still very large gaps and the statistics of all countries carmot be regarded as equally reliable  Such as they are  the figures show that in the world as a whole  the sex ratio is probably 992  that is to say  tbere is perhaps a male excess in the world as a whole  but  if there is  it is very very small  It is certain that the sexes are more nearly equal to one another in the world as a whole than they arc in India  We have seen that there are large variations in the sex ratio between different parts of India  In the same way  there are also large variations between different parts of the world  In all countries of Europe  except Ireland and Bulgaria  there is an excess of females  This seems to be true also of the Soviet Union  In the United States of America there used to be an excess of males among the people of European descent and an excess of females among the negroes  In Canada  Australia  New Zealand and South Mrica there has alwuys been a male excess among people of European descent  The South American countries show instances both of male excess and female excess  A large female excess seems to be a general characteristic of many peoples of Africa  It is found in the Gold Coast  Nigeria  Uganda  and Tanganyika  In Morocco and Tunisia  however  there is a male excess   41  How do such differences arise  It is easy enough to see why a female deficiency should be found in cities and the major towns  It arises mainly by migratlon of people who go there in search of livelihood  These are  in the first instance  mostly men  It is true that when the men settle down the women may move up to join them  but this does not happen invariably  and there is always a very considerable time lag  So long  therefore  as towns continue to grow  they are apt to have a diminishing sex ratio  When this  58  \fSEX RAtIO  process stOPS  and the towns grow mainly by the excess of births over deaths  the sex ratio tends to change in the opposite direction and towards equality  Somewhat similar considerations apply to a whole area  including villages and towns  if~t is receiving migrants in large numbers  An important reason for the  emale excess of Europe and the male excess of people of the same stock in America  Oceania and Africa must no doubt be found in the selective character of migration    42  This would not  however  explain the female deficiency of India  much less of North India because the migratory movements in question are too small in relation to the total population  The true explanation has to be found in two facts  First   Males and females are not born in equal numbers  and Secondly   They do not die in equal numbers either in infancy and childhood or in old age or in any panicular age group  or at all ages taken together  43  If we examine the statistics of registration of births in Madras for 10 years preceding the 1951 Census  we find that for every 1000 male children born during the decade  only 948 female children were born  The ratio was as high as 959 in one year  1941  and as low as 937 in another year  1949   These figLlr~s  which  are not very different from one another  represent the extremes  the ratios for all other years fell between these two limits  A similar examination of the statistics of ten years in three other states besides Madras  gives us the following results   TABLE 13 Sex ratio at birth during 1941  50                      State  Madras Madhya Pradesh Bomhsy  Unar Pradesh  Average  Highest during decade  Lowesl during decade  948  959  937  939 935  946  921  937  93 1  857  874  843  These figures are very instructive and three points should be noted about them  FiT  it   In every case  there is a definite excess of male births over female births    S9  \fCHAPTER iI   THE PAITERN OF LiviNG t95t  Secondly   The excess is very much more pronounced in Uttar Pradesh  North India  than in the other three states  which may be taken to be broadly representative of South India  Central India and West India   and Thirdly     The lowest and highest values recorded  over a period of ten years do not differ very much  and this fact shows that the occurrence of an excess at birth is not an accident  nor is the fact that this excess is much more pronounced in Uttar Pradesh than in the other states  It would seem that we are face to face with the working of some biological law  Is that conclusion valid or is it vitiated by the fact that all births do not get registered  We know It is also true that the extent there are omission c   in the registration of births  of such omissions is not the same in all the states  It cannot  therefore  be denied that it is difficult to be certain on the conclusion stated  It i~  however  exceedingly unlikely that the omitted births  if registered  would alter the pattern so materially as to invalidate the conclusion  The causes which lead to the omissions of registration of births are not peculiar to female births  Female births are not much more likely to get omitted than male births  It is difficult to think of any kind of systematic bias which would lead to continuous and universal suppression of female births in such large numbers  44  We must accept the existence of a male excess at birth as a fact  A deficiency of females arises in all parts of India as a biological phenomenon  It is belivcd that this happens jn almost all parts of the world  Nature having given rise to inequality  then appcms to set about redressing it  There is a bias in infant deaths just as there is a bias in births  Male infants die in larger numbers than female infants before completing the first year of life  The following table shows the figures for the same four states for which data regarding sex ratio at birth were given already   TABLE 14       State  Madras  Madhya Pradesh  Bombay  Uttar Pradesh  60  Sex ratio of infants who died within one year of birth during 1941 50                      A                               Average  Highest during decade  Lowest during decade  \fSEX RATIO  Here again the question arises  can we be sure that we arc not being misled by the selective omission of female infant deaths  All things are possible  but we have to judge what is probable  Large and consistent difference    such a5 we see in TABLE 14 cannot be attributed to this cause  There is  fortunately  some corroborative evidence  If it is really true that fewer female infanrs die than male inHmts  then the sex ratio of all infants living at  my one time must be closer to 1000  the index of equality  than the sex ratio at birth  This is exactly what the census figures show  as may be seen frl1n1 th~ tabk below  TABLE 15  Slale  Madras Madhya Pradesh Bombay Uttar Pradesh  Sex ratio at birth  1 II j   RegisTration data   Sex ratio among infants      J   Censux data   940 92 1 93 1 843  It will be observed that of all the four stales  Madras had the smallest excess of maks at birth  Within a year  the inequality is wiped out and female infants outnumber male infants  OJ  the other hand  Uttar l rJdesh  which had the largest male excess  ha l got this excess somewhat diminished  hut yet male infants outnumber female infants decisively  Here again rigofOU   logic demand~ that we should make allowance for possible errors in the statement of age at the census  Rut most people would agree that even jf the figures are not exactly correct  they provide good enough corroboration    r  45  In the next section  we shall sec that just as the proportion of males and females alters during the first y~al  of liii    it alters c  ontinually from year to year as people grow older  The strain of life and the risk of death tell heavily on women at some ages and on men at others  This causes inequality in the numbers of males and females dying at different ages  There seems to be no uniform rule governing this inequality at all places and times  conditions differ in different parts of the country at the same time and they have  no doubt  changed from·time to time even at the same place  There is  however  a very near approach to uniformity towards the end of life  just as there wac   at the beginning of life  Among the very old  as in the first year of life  the hand of death falls on men more frequently than on women   61  \f   HAPTER 11   THE PATTERN OF LIVlNG I 9S1  46  What has been said so far is applicable mainly to what may be called  normal  mortality  In the past  different parts of the country used to suffer from  abnormal  mortality  Once every few years  the hand of death fell more heavily than nonnally  famine and pestilence occurred in extensive areas and tooK a heavy toll  On these occasions  it has been observed and recorded that deaths took place in notably unequal numbers among males and females  Men used to die more than women when great famines occurred  On the other hand  many forms of pestilence  especially plague  took a far heavier toll of women than of men  When  therefore  we observe the sex ratio at anyone time and anyone place we should remember that it is the result of a long previous history of UlleqUal numbers of male births and female births at times corrected and at other times aggravated by unequal incidence of death  normal as well as abnormal  In some places the ratios may have heen further modified by emigration or immigration  47  When all this has been said  people will still want to know why male births should persistently exceed female births  in all states   Why should this excess of male births over female births be persistently larger in Uttar Pradesh and persistently smaller in other states  Again it may be asked  why is it that the hand of death spares females more than males at the begining and the end of life  and why the chances of death throughout life  should favour the females more in some SUites than in others   It is possible that some completely satisfactory explanation of these facts has been propounded by scientists who may have made a special study of them  but the preseilt writer  who has not been able to make a detailed enquiry  has not come across any such explanation      Mention should be made of an opinion which has been frequently advanced  It is said  on the better care end attention   in hcuscholds than female children and it is surmised that this must have a significant effect on mortality at carly age and again after infancy and consequently on the sex ratio  The implication II that this ill a more pronounced characteristic of Indian household than of European households  and  within India  of North Indian and North West Indian households than households in other zones Of India  All this seems plausible but it is to be doubted Whether the surmise is correct  SO 10D  aa females survive better dnn males  and this occurs during and for sometime aftcr thc first year of life    the ftct is atributed to nature  When the opposite  occurs  it is attributed to nurture  basi~ of general impression  that male children receive  62  \fAge PyraInids    India and U  S  A   \fAGE

censuses  the age of every CItIZen was ascertained and recorded  In some countries  the actual date of birth is sought to be ascertained  not always very successfully  This is out of the question in India  as the number of people who recollect or keep 1 record of their date of birth is altogether negligible  We seek only to a~certain the age in number of years  There used to be some difficulty of definition  whether age meant the number of completed years at the birthday preceding the enquiry  or the birthday succeeding the enquiry or at the birthday which is nearest to the enquiry  In India  we have settled down to the first of these three definitions of age  An infant is defined as  a child which has not yet completed 12 months of life   49  Specifications of this kind have value only at very young agcs  where a few months more or less may make a large difference to the numbers  But  in general  so few people know their age correct to the nearest year that the errors which may arise out of an unprecise definition are small in comparison with the errors which arise out of ignorance of the actual age  All the world over people seem to make much the same kind of elTor about age  In some countries  the people err in large number than in others  In general  the people who do not know their own age exactly tend to estimate it by quinquenniums or decades  The people who have returned ages ending in 0 or 5 are very much more numerous than those who have returned ages ending in adjoining digits  Others who try to make a closer approximation prefer to think of their age as an even number rather than any odd number  except five   At lower agc  ~  there are some preferences which are even more well marked  Age 12 is extremely popular and age 18 is nearly so  We do not apparently share  however  one weakness which is prominently observed in some other countries  Our women folk  speaking generally and in large numbcrs  are not keen on being recorded as younger than they are  The real difficulty in our country has been not so much the tendency to prefer particular digits  of which we have very much more than our fair share   as complete inability to make any returns at all  A surprisingly large number of people decline even to make the attempt to figure out their own age  As part of a regular routine based on experience  the enumerators were warned in advance against this contingency and clearly instructed that they must make an effort to make the best possible estimate of age in such cases with the help of bystanders  They were equipped for this purpose  with a  calendar of important events    eyents of such local notoriety that every  63  \fCHAPTER II   THE PATTERN OF LIVING I951  one could be expected to remember one or other of them  and recall what he was like when the event occurred  The enumerator would then work out the age for him  Information about women is frequently obtained second hand  So the estimates arc apt to be cruder for women than for men  In spite of all difficulties  we have got a very complete return of agethe number of persons for whom age was not recorded works out to only about 6 per 10 000  It was the practice  followed at the 1931 Census as   well as some earlier censuses  to submit the returns of age thus secured to a kind of purification ceremony  The high priest must be an actuary who can use complicated mathematical formulae in order to purge the returns of irregularities caused by biases for particular digits and thus produce  smoothed  Age Tables  Thls was a necessary preliminary to a further process of calculation which yielded  Life Tables   The practice was followed at this census also  The examination of returns was carried out by Shri S  P  JAIN of the Ministry of Labour  Government of India  He has tarried out this work with great thoroughness and prepared  smoothed  Age Tables and Life Tables  They have been published separately along with detailed explanatory reports submitted by the officer  In addition  the original returns furnishing the figures for each year of age  as recorded  have also been published so that users of census statistics may study for themselves the nature of the biases which were present and make their own independent calculations  if so desired  While these elaborate precautions are necessary before the data can be used for refined computations  where single year age returns are significant  it is found that figures for each and every year of age are unnecessary for most purposes   figures for broad age groups of ten years each  or even broader  are ample at the higher ages and five year groups are sufficient at younger ages after the fifth year  As the original returns  whether furnished by the citizen himself or estimated for him by the enwnerator  are generally correct to this degree of approximalion  it will be found that the  unsmoothed  figures are good enough  provided they are not relied on for mdividual ages or narrower age groups than those mentioned above  50   51  The picture presented by these returns may be readily grasped by reference to the  age pyramid  diagrams preceding this section  Let us follow the first of these diagrams  which relates to the country as a whole  including towns as well as villages  The bottom slab of the pyramid  it will be obeserved  is ha1f as broad as all the other slabs above it  This is because it stands for infants and yotmg  li4     \fAGE STRUCTURE   children  those who are 0  I  2  3 or 4 years old  a five year age group   All other slabs  which are twice as broad as the bottom slab  stand fur ten year age groups  viz   5 14  15 24 25 34 and so on except the top most slab which stands for all ages above 74  The first fact to be noticed is that the length of every higher slab is smaller than that of the lower slab for there were fewer people in it  The number in each slab  is shown below as a percentage of the total number of all ages   TABLE 16  Age group  Percentage  Infants and young children  o to 4  13 5  Boys and girls    5 to 14  24 8  Young men and women  Middle aged men and women  Elderly persons  J  IS to 24   l  17

First we note that the bottom slab in America  is shorter than in India  In America infants and young children are 10  8 per cent while they are 13  5 per cent in India  Looking up  we find the next slab to be even shorter  American boys and girls number 16  3 per cent only  while Indian boys and girls number 24 8 per cent  If we combine the two slabs together they are 26 3 per cent under age 15 in America  while the corresponding number in India is 38 3 per cent  The next two slabs stand for  young men and women   The lower slab of America is somewhat shorter than ours  while the higher slab is the first to be somewhat larger  Adding up  young men and women are 30  4 per cent in America against 33  0 per cent in India    The next two slabs of middle aged men and women are both larger in America than in India  the total· number in America is 25·6 per ceRt again~t India s 20· 4 per cent  The last three slabs of elderly persons arc similarly larger ill America than in India  The total nl Jmbcr jn America is J6  9 per cent against India s 8  3 per cent· 65  \fCHAPtER n   THE PATTERN OF LlVING  I951  53   It is very important that we should take note of the enormous difference between India and America in respect of the area of the two bottom slabs  Out of every 1 000 persons  there are 271 people under age 15 in America and there are 3 3 in India  The number is nearly one half as large again in India as in America  This means  even if an average Indian married couple had the same resources to  spend on bringing up their children as an average American married couple  each Indian child can only get a much smaller share of these resoW ces than each American cbild  because the same resoW ces have to be spread over a larger number  Actually  of course  the resources available to an average Indian married couple are very much smaller  which makes the disparity in the number to be looked after  all the more serious  The dry figures tell their story quite c1early  in terms of food  shelter  care and attention during illness  education and every kind of preparation for life  the Indian child is handicapped unmistakably and of necessity  54  The following table shows  in one view  how the juvenile proportion varies in different zones of India and compares it with that of Japan  and a few EW Opean countries   TABLE 17 Percentage to total population of Persons

The proportions for the zones of India have been worked out from age tables which excluded displaced persons  The figures for North·West India which are inclusive of displaced persons are as follows  Pel lODll under age IS 39 6 Infanta and young children 14  5 ao  l and girl  2~    \fA GE STRUCTURE  It may be observed that the juvenile proportion is very similar in all the zones   it is somewhat smaller in Japan but not very different  the proportions for all the four European countries are very much smaller   55  Infants numbered 3 3 per cent of the population  or almost exactly one in thirty  among the people of India  The highest proportion was found in North West India  4  I  and the lowest in South India  2  6   The figures for other zones  in order  were  East India  3  7   North India and West India  3  3  and Central India  3  0    It might seem at first sight that this is probably also the order in which the zones would be placed if arranged according to their birth rate  But this does not follow  necessariJy  For one thing  the number of infants counted at the census represents the number born during the preceding 12 months less those among them who died during the preceding 12 months  The rates of infant mortality need not differ from one zone to another in the same manner as the birth rate  in fact  they do not  So  the proportion of the net number of infants found and counted need not indicate the order among zones as regards children born  Again  as noted already  there is need for caution in acting on figures for single years  Though there is little difficulty about recollecting whether a child had completed 12 months or not  one cannot be sure that significant errors did not creep in  A consistent error of even one month in either direction might make a sizeable difference in the resulting number and percentages  There is also a special difficulty  In compiling the tables on which these results are based  displaced persons were excluded  Such exclusions make little difference to the relative proportions of different age groups in most parts of the country  But in North West India where the upheaval was greatest  the figures are bound to be distorted  The distinction must be specially observable among infants and young children since the children of displaced persons are not reckoned as displaced persons and have been counted in   56  Infants and young children  These are all children under 5  They number 13  5 per cent of the total population  that is to say  rather more than one in eight and less than one in seven     The proportion is IS 6 per cent in North West India where it is accidentally exaggerated for the reasons already noticed  It is lowest in South India where it is 12  5 per cent  In the other four zones  it is very nearly the same   W~l 1Jldia  Ir8~ East India  13  7  North India  13 5   and Central  frt  \fTJ re r  TTERN OJ   UVING  t951  CHAPTER II   India  13  4   The low figure for South India  as we shall see pres~ly  is corroborated by corresponding differences in birth rates and death rates   57  Infants  young children  boys and girls  These include all people under age 15  In the country as a whole  they number 38  3 per cent of the total population  As in the younger groups the proportion is lowest in South India  36 9  and accidentally exaggerated in North West India

should be borne in mind that the relevant figures are a corollary of two facts   first that towns have fewer women relatively than villages and so relatively fewer children are born   and secondly  towns grow in part by migratory movements in which persons under age 15 tend to be under represented   61  The differences in age structure between the rural and urban population become greatly exaggerated in the cities  ThLc  is clearly brought out by the fantastic distortions of the age pyramid for Greater Bombay and Calcutta citiesthe last two of the series of  age pyramid  diagrams  The

195I  because more and more of them would get married in later years  Thus  for instance  the proportion of unmarried women to the total population of India diminishes rapidly  with successive age

West India have rather more widows than East India  North India and North West India  There is one widow for every three married women in South India  while the India ratio is very nearly one to four   67  It may seem a bit odd that there should be an appreciable difference in numbers between married males and married females  as polygamy  though it exists  is known to be very rare  The explanation is to be found in the fact that the percentages refer to males and females separately and the sexes are unequal in number  Actually married males and married females are almost exactly equal in number in the country as a whole  Out of every 10 000 persons in India  there are 2 353 married males for every 2 357 married females  But the corresponding figures for zones are not nearly so close to one another as the following table shows   TABLE 28  Number per 10 000 persons who are  Column  1 minus  Zone  Married males  Married females  column 2  1  2  J  4  2 44 1 2 53 2 2 074 2 228 2 463 2 3 2 6

balanced numbers  There is a small  but nevertheless curious  excess of married females in South India  On the other hand  there is an almost equal excess of married males in East India  Similarly  there is as excess of married males in North West India  matched by somewhat smaller excesses of married females in North India and Central India  As there is no suggestion of polyandry in East India  it may be assumed that the main explanation for these minor differences must be found in migration  It is probable that a good many missing husbands of South India are earning a living in other zones or outside India~ while the wives are at home  This fact of temporary separation of husbands and wives is brought out more prominently when we consider the figures for villages and towns  Out of 10 000 persons in all the villages of India 2 338 are married males and 2A07 are married females  The excess of married females in villages is of the order of 69 per IO OOO~  75  \fciuPrER It               ~  I  THE PAttERN OF LIV1NG l95 tl  Aroong 10 000 persons in all the towns of India  there are 2  pg married males and only 2 105 married females  The excess of married males in towns is of the order of 324 per 10 000  There are very wide differences in this respect between the zones  ThUs in South Indian towns  the number of husbands  2 °78  does not eXceed the number of wives  2 124   while in the towns of East India there are as many as 2 992 husbands and only 1 909 wives  68  We may conclude this section with a reference to a somewihat iinportant change that appears to be taking place in the marital stanis pattern  tJiz   a fall in the proportion of widows  The following table compares the proportion of widows and widowers between 1931 and 1951  and shows that the proportion of widows has decreased in every zone   TABLE 29  Percentage of widowers Percentage 0  widows to alJ males lO all females Zone  1931  1951  1931  19fH  North India  7 9  4 7 4  x  7 1 4 4  15 1  East

proportion of widowers has also dropped in five out of six zones but the difference is small  The decreases in the percentage of widows between 1931 and 1951 are too large and too consistent to be dismissed as accidental  They are clearly significant  but what do they signify  Do they mean that husbands tend to live longer than they used to and so the proportion of widows is falling  Or do they mean that the custom of non remarriage of widows is weakening and more women tend to remarry after widowhood than before  There arc some valuable indications pointing to increasing longevity as a fact~ while there is little evjdence of any very striking departures from custom in respect of remarriage of widows  On the whole  one is inclined to accept the former as the main  if not the sole  expianatiom of the fall in the proportion of widows  76  \fBIRTH RAmS AND  DEATH RATES  In that case  it may be objected  whyis there no similar faU of a substantial nature in  the proportion of widowers  In support of this objection  it may be contended that it is very unlikely that the conditions which have favoured an increase in  the length of life are specially favourable to males only and have not benefited females equally  The objection  though apparently strong  is not conclusive  Since there is no custom of non remarriage of widowers the small proportion of widowers represents mainly the hard core of old men who will not ~Il a rry because they are too old  and also a number of others who have become widowers but have not yet remarried but would do so sooner or later  Women may tend to live longer than before  without making any difference to the latter class of widowers and they may not also make a difference to the former if the improved expectation of life is evenly spread over all ages and not concentrated at old ages  The objection is not sustainable  It is quite possible that both men and women have equally benefited by conditions favouring a longer life than formerly   and yet the result is made visible by a substantial drop in the pwportion of widows  and only a very small one in the proportion of widowers  It is probably correct to hold that the drop in the proportion of widows need not necessarily have been caused by any very material change in the custom of non remarriage of widows  It should  on the other hand  be accepted as one of the indications that fewer people die prematurely and more people tend to live long  or  in other words  a modest improvement in the expectation of life has taken place within the last two d~cades   F   Birth Rates and Death Rates BlRms AND DEATIIS arc among the most important events which occur  in the life of every household  OUf knowledge of how lhe number and the living pattern of our people have changed in the past and  therefore  our opinion about how they may be expected to change in the future are bound to be vague and sketchy  if not incorrect  unless we achieved a clear understanding of the relationship between these vital events and the changing pattern of life  70  Government have made arranf   ments for ~ccuring that births and deaths are reported as and when they occur and the occurrences are placed on record together with essential minimum information regarding date and pJace  77  \fCHAPTER II   THE PATTERN OF LIVING l951  and parties concerned  There is the system of official registration of bjrths and deaths  The primary data thus secured are then compiled and returns showing the numbers of births and deaths in different parts of the country as weJI as birth rates and death rates computed from them  are published at regular inter· vals by State Governments  for each State and by the Central Government  for India  If reporting is complete and the basic records are correctly maintained  the changes in numbers recorded by the census at ten yearly intervals should tally with the balance of births and deaths during the ten year period  leaving only a relatively small margin to be explained by the net balance of migration of people  in and out of the territory in questiC n     71  Let us take Uttar Prade sh as an illustrat on  In 1951 the state had a total population of 632 Jakhs  Ten years earlier  according to the 1941 Census  there were 565 lakhs of people in the same territory  The number had grown by 67 lakhs in ten years  There were arrangements for registration of births and deaths in most villages and towns of the state  but some small bits of territory  of the princely states which were  merged  in Uttar Pradesh shortly before the 1951 Census  did not have them  This is a complication but a small one  because the population of the area where there was no registration was a little Wlder one fortieth of the whole state and we may make allowances accordingly  During ten years preceding the 1951 Census the authorities of Uttar Pradesh registered 145 lakhs of births  They also registered 971akhs of deaths  The excess of births over deaths being 48 lakhs  the population must have increased by that number  According to the census  the increase was 67 lakhs  How are we to accOlUlt for the remaining 19 lakhs   Were they displaced persons who had come into the state from Pakistan  No  we have counted them  they are only 5 lakhs  We also know that at about the time they came in  others migrated to Pakistan from Uttar Pradesh  Though we do not know this number precisely  we have reasons to believe that it was not perhaps far short of the nwnber who came in  So the question about the 191akhs remains to be answered  Evidently  a great many binhs escaped registration  and so also  no doubt  deaths  The basic record is materially incomplete  This incompleteness is indicated by census results in another way also  The births registered during 10 years work out to a rate  in roWld figures  of 25 per thousand people per annum  We have already noted in the last section  however  that the count of infants in this state yielded 33 per thousand  Maybe  this number was somewhat swollen b~ countin~ I~  month ot~ b~bi~ also   S  78  \fBIRTH RATES AND DE TH RATES  infants  But  even so  if we make allowance for the number of infants who must have died during the year preceding the census  the census count of  infants is a clear indication that actual births must have exceeded registered births fairly substantially  The problem is  how are we to have a reasonably close estimate of the actual number of births and the actual birth rate as against the registered birth rate  There is a similar problem about deaths and death rates  The importance of solving this probJem cannot be over stressed  To illustrate  the registration figures of Uttar Pradesh show that in each of the two previous decades 1931 40 as well as 1921 30  registered Qirths were working oPt to an average rate  in round figures  of 34 per thousand people per annum  There is a sharp difference between 25  the registered birth rate during 1941 50  and 34  at each of two preceding decades   If this difference is real and if similar drops were observed in other states  the figures will prove that there is no such thing as a population problem in India  and if there was  the problem was solvmg itself  That is  in fact  what a number of peop e think and say  But suppose the difference is due mcre y to the fact that the registration system has become less efficient than before  and so more births escaped registration during the last decade than during two previous decades  Suppose further  that we could form a reliable estimate of the extent of omission in different decades  Then the inferences to be drawn from the figures will be very clifferent  Our appreciation of the problem and our approach to its solution will tum out to be very different   72  Uncertainties of this kind are present in every state  Among the major states  Madras  Bombay  Madhya Pradesh and the Punjab are the or ly four states where the registration system functions reasonably well and omissions are not unduly large  The other states fall into three groups  those for which figures are availabJe over a long period  though they are not very goed figures  those for which figures  not very good  are available now for some recent Yfars but not over a long period  and those for which there are no figurf S at all even now  If we exc ude the last two categories  we are left with a territory which contains roughly three quarters of India s popuJation  It was no use merely saying that we do not have complete  information and can  therefore  come to no conclusions  It will take a long time t cfol c we get data which are free from all uncertainties  Meanwhile  we have to form as good a judgment as we can  on all the materials before us  about how the observed growth of population as di ~closed by censuses should be split up into binhs7 deaths  and the n et bahmte of nU~tion  To this end  it was necessary  7

Hence  the natural increase of the population has been occurring  during the ten years 1941 5°  at an average rate of 13 per thousnnd per annum  We may refer to these rates as the birth rate  40   death rate  27  and natural increase rate  13   They relate to India within hcr present boundaries during the decade preceding the 1951 Census  11  The zonal variations of the India picture are as follows    t  The highest birth rate is found in Central India  44   and the lowest birth rate in South India  36 or 37   The birth rates of other zones  in order  are  West India  42   North West India  41 or 42   North India and East India  for both of which the birth rates are 38 or 39    it  The highest death rate is found in Central India  34   and the lowest death rate in South India  21

during one year  But as births occur only to married women of certain ages it is their nurr ber which is  really relevant  It is true that the limiting ages cannot be preci~cly laid down  It is also possible that some births occur to women who are not married  But  where we are striking a rate for 1 000 people  we do not base ourselves on the actual occurrences of birth among 1 000 peopl~ only  but among lakhs and even crores uf p~oplc  We may  therefore  disregard exceptional occurrences and treat married women of age ~5 to 44 as the people who alone are relevant in this context  It would follow that if one part of the country contained more married women of age IS to 44 per 1 000 people than another  then  other things be i QB equal  the former would have a higher birth rate than the latter  The same would be tIVe 9f the same territory at different times  a ~ in the proportion of married women pf age IS to 44 would  other tbings being ~ual  be accom~ pawed by similar change in the

ERII1  OF· LIVING I951  women of age ~5 to 44 in  different parts of the countrY  or at different times in the same part of the country  and yet have different  birth rates  Two sets of circumstances may be  named  First   the age structure within this group may be materially different   Thus  if we have one lakh of married women of age  25 to 34 and another lakh of married women of age 35 to 44 drawn from the samep8rt of the country  we may be fairly certain that the number of births occu~­ ring among the first group in the course of a year will be larger than the number of   births  occurring ~ong the   second group  Secondly  it does not follow t~ar  if we  compared two groups of married women of the same number and the same age group  say 25 to 34   but selected the groups from two different parts of the country   we would get the same number of babies born among them in any  one year  Apart from purely accidental and personal differences b¢tWeet  one woman and anot her  it seems possible that there are statistically significant differences between different groups of women   but why should they be  It is difficult to be  sure  there may be something in the blood  or the climate  and there may be more in the prevailing habits of conjugal life  At this census we have been able to collect some information on these matters  in part  through a local census question  which was put in some states only   and in part  through an  Experimental Census of Birth and Deaths  carried out in a few states  sometime after the main cel18US was over  Let us begin with a review of the facts which we have ascertained in Travancpre Cochin  about all women who have had at least  one child birth and  lp z   remained manied on census day  77  Among these mothers  those who were 45· years old or older were separated    The total number of children born to all of them was divided by the total number of such mothers  The result was 6  6  This shows that on an average  a Travancore Cochin mother who lives to complete her child   bearing period gives birth to more than 6 children but not more than 7  OUt    of  this  number  6  6   the average number actually alive on census day

birth index is I  2  the child survival index is I  0  and the child loss index is o· 2  The indices increase  at  five~yearly intervals as shown in TABLE 30 on opposite page   e2  \fMATERNITY  PA1 1

is Ihtle doubt about the place of the agricultural labourer in the social scale anywhere in India  The figures for agricultural  labourers  families in Travancore Cochin do not show that this generalisation is true in that state   The urban index is slightly smaller than the rural   But the difference is so small that it is probably not significant  80  One other separation was effected

approximately one eighth  The reduction in the birth rate will be even smaller  this depending on the proportion which mothers of  Typs Ii bear to the total number of mothers  81  The child birth indices were also calculated for mothers who had become widows by census day  It was found that on an average for all ages  the child birrh index of widowed mothers was larger  4  9 agairnt 4  3 of

the divhions of Madh ya Prade~h than in Travancore Cochln  In fact  the figure is slightly smaller in two divi  ioIlS of Madhya Pradesh  Yet there is·no d  ubt that the birth rate in Madhya Pradesb·is very distinctly higher than in Travancore~Cochin  It is dearly verifiablo that tho difference is caused by d iff~rcnccs in the proportion of  married wom~m of different age groups to the total population       Secondly   The child loss index is unmistakably higher in rrll th~  three divisions of Madhya Pradesh than in Travancore Cochin  This fact is  hi  accord With much other evidence which points to MadhYd Pradesh as having a very hi~ death rate   83  A comparative study of the figures of Madhya  Pradesh with   those of Trava ncore Cochin indicates that the features already noticed in TravancoreCochin are aiso observable in Madhya Pradesh divisions  The tendency for the tempo of child birth to accelerate until a mid maternal age is reached arid then  to relax ~ age advances  is clearly observed  In general  the·  rural urbart differentials  and  8  cial class differentials  do nor appear to be inlporrilnt    There is a diminution in the total number of children bom when the age of commence    · ment of child birth is postponed  but the difference is not very striking        11  Pl y Qe  QJ el tioned that a SRlllple eaquiry made in  villages  In  tWQ groups

in both groups of districts    The extent to which the census figures of Travancore Cochin and Madhya Pradesh divisions  as well as the sample enquiry figures of West Bengal might be affected by error has not been studied in detail  It is noticed  however  that they hang together so well as to justify confidence  In general  it may be observed that there is little likelihood of significant error in the child survival index  It is practically certain that the child birth indices are not overstated  At older ages  some women may have forgotten to count the number of children borne by them  completely  The true figures might  therefore  be somewhat higher than those given above  But judging from the graphs furnished in the diagrams given earlier in this section it seems likely that the allowance required to be made on account of such error is probably not large   r For fuller information on all these data  reference may be made to the brochure on  Maternity Data I95I Census  issued as Census of India Paper NO 5 of I953  Some extracts arc also given in ApPENDIX II   84  Information of this kind is not available for many countries of the world  But very detailed data have been published for the United Kingdom among the papers accompanying the Report  issued in the year 1949  of the Royal Commission en PopUlation  The relevant figures of that country have been extracted and included for reference in ApPENDIX VII   ~ J  ffti ould seem that the child birth index  i e   average number of live births per mother after completion oJ her child bearing period  exceeded six  in much the same way as in India for those mothers of the United Kingdom who married in or about1860  The index has fallen steadily since  It was reduced to 4 0 for women who married in the firsl decade of this century and is now about Z· 4 or not more than two fifths of the figures observed in different parts of India  It will be noted that the relation between the India Birth Rate  40  and the U  K  Birth Rate  16  is more or less of the same order   85  There is anotber   and even more instru   tive  way in which the salient features of the materruty pattern can be expressed  Out of all the

emerges  South India presents a slightly different pattern from West  Central and NorthWest India  but the difference is consistent with the known difference    in birth ratcs  Speaking generally  first bjrths account for rathcr more than oncfifth of all births   sccond bjrths account for very nearly another one fifth  third births accormt for about onc sixth of all births  well over two fifths of all births are fourth birth   or births of a higher order  We can put the matter even more simply  The total number of births which occur in the course oj one year among about 1 000 people oj India is 40  Among these 40 births  8 births are first births    16 births are either first births or second births   2 1 births are either firse  second or third births   and 17 births out oj 40 are either

HOUSEHOLD  round  otherwise the people carmot live  A few other goods are almost equally indispensable  fuel to cook the foodstuffs  cloth  and so on  Mter this  there is a considerable variety  Some families get and use a great many goods and services  others manage with very little  All these goods and services may be described as  means of living    Some families get the greater part of their  means of living  directly  when they cultivate the land and grow their own food  Even they have to get an income in the form of money in order to buy the other  means of living   Familes which do not grow their own food  get income wholly in money which they use to buy all their  means of living   We use the term  livelihood  to mean both types of incom   in kind as well as in money  A few families  much fewer than is supposed  get their  livelihood  without anyone having to work for it  Subject to this exception  one or two or more people in every family have got to do some work or other in order to earn the livelihood needed by the family  We use the expression  Means of Livelihood  to mean the work  by which livelihood is earned  and  in the exceptional circumstances where an unearned income is obtained  the nature of such unearned income  We put questions and ascertained in respect of every man  woman  and child whom we counted  what his or her  means of livelihood  was  The records containing this information for about 3 lakhs of people in the Punjab were destroyed by fire  About the rest  numbering 3 S661akhs  we have got a complete account  The information has been sorted and compiled into Economic Tables  The Economic Tables of the 1951 Census show  ror the country as a whole  for ~ S18tel nal lllLl djv~jonl distrl~ an~ the dilerent parts of the district   8

country  By grouping the people in this way according to their means of livelihood we get categories  classeS  sub classes  sections  divisions and sub divisions  This is a complete economic classification of the people  A full explanation of the definitions and classifications will be found in APPENDIX III  This paper also contains a detailed review of the data  together with a discussion of possible errors and defects in them  In this chapter  a brief account is given in simple terms without entering into unduly technical discussions  2  Non earning dependants  Out of the total of 3 5661akhs  2 I431akhs of people  or 60  I per cent  have been classified as  non earning dependants   They do not take any part in TABLE I procuring their own livelihood  In the main  they consist of women Non earm ng dependan18 and children who are supported Number   J  by the husband and father or  IN LAKHS  Percentage other b rea d w inn e r of the household  They do not  however

than among males  It is higher among urban females than among rural females mainly because the latter lend a hand in cultivation while the former do not have that opportunity  Non earning dependency is a shade higher among urban males than among rural males  It mayor may not be significant   3  Earning dependants  There are 379 lakhs of people  or 10 6 per cent of the total number  who are classified as  earning dependants   They are dependants in the sense that left to themselves  they cannot support themselves  They are also  in the main  women or grown up children  but they are not  non earning dependants  either because they earn some income which is sufficient to meet part of the cost of their maintenance or else they are unpaid family helpers in cultivation  or other business  like handloom weaving for 90  \fINDIA PICTURB  instance  by which the livelihood of the family is earned   In the latter case  their participation is so limited that they are not regarded as earning the full cost of their maintenance thereby  If  however  they take a more effective part they would not be classified as  earning dependants   but as  selfsupporting persons   TABLE 2 shows the rural urban and sex wise break up of  earning dependants   These figures show that  earning dependants  are relatively TABLE 2 unimportant in towns  both in absolute number and percentage  ~   ~endanu 1

livelihood of the family   4  Self supporlins  persons  Everyone who is not a dependant is classified as a  self supporting person  which means   he  or she  procures an income which is at least sufficient for his  or her  own maintenance  As the entire cost of maintenance of non eaming dependants and part of the cost of maintaining earning dependants has to be ~ met by self supporting persons  it is evident that most of them procure an income which is substantially in excess of the actual cost of their own maintenance  There are  in all  I 044 Iakhs of self supporting persons  or 29 3 per cent of the total number  TABLE 3 shows the rural urban and sex wise break up of these I 044 lakhs  On the TABLE 3 whole  women number rather less Self supporting   ef som than one in six among all selfr Number A         supporting persons  In villages  IN LAKHS  Percentage they are more than one in six  but                             less than one in five  In the towns  Rural mal 706

exactly they do in order to get a living     5  There is  first  a broad division  Out of 1 044 lakhs  710 lakhs  or 68  I per cent  are  agriculturists   and 334lakhs or  31  9 per cent  are  non agriculturists   The distinction between the two is simple  Anyone whose inCome is derived from the cultivation of land  whether this be in the form of net profits of cultivation  or of wages for employment as cultivating labourer  or of rent received by virtue of vested rights by a non cultivating land holder  is classified as an  agriculturist   All other self supporting persons are classified as  nonagriculturists   It may happen  of course  that some self supporting persons may be  in receipt of income of two different varieties  In such cases  that income which is the larger of the two is taken into consideration for purposes of classification as agriculturist or non agriculturist  The rural urban and sex wise break up of agriculturists and nonagriculturists is shown

misconceptions  It is not seldom supposed that  rural  and  agricultural  mean more or ·less the same thing  or that  urban  and  non agricultural  are very nearly identical  This is not correct  Roughly  one among every five st l£ supporting persons in villages  male as well as female  is a non agriculturist  Among self supporting males in towns  one in nine is an agriculturist  The ratio is even higher among self supporting females  but this is unimportant  be~ 1OO ~  \f  tNbt    Picritirlt  tbdr absoiute number is quite small   One  might suppose that the agriculturists in towns must be non cWtivating landholders who live on rent  This not correct  ~ we shall see presently  the number of agricultural rentiers livjng in villages as well as towns is a very much smaller fraction of the total number of all agriculturists in the country  Cultivation is carried on the periphery of all towns  Some cultivators and even cultivating labourers live there  The proportion of such people is very small in the cities and major towns  but is qwte considerable in the minor towns and townships   is  m  6  Let us leave the non agriculturists for a time  and follow up our 710 lakhs of agriculturists  They are divided into four classes as below  TABLE 5  Percentage Percentage  of all  Number  agricul    iN LAKHS   turists  seljsupporting persons  I Cultivators of land wholly or

agriculturists have been clivided   7  Among the four classes  Livelihood Class IV  whom we shall refer to as  agricultural rentiers  for short  is numerically insignificant  This class includes two quite different types of people referred to as  non cuItivating owners of land  and  other agricultural rent receivers   In popular imagination  the  proprietors of zamindaris and other estates come first  They are the people referred to to as  other agricultural rent   receivers   This is a better description of such people than  non cultivating owners of land   because their legal rights over the whole or greater part of the cultivated land in the estate are strictly limited to the receipt of a rent  which may not be changed except by  93  \fCHAPTER III   UVELIHOOD PATTERN I951  prescribed statutory processes   They are disentitled to enter on such lands for purposes of cultivation even if they wanted to  These people are  agricultural rentiers  by legal prescription  not necessarily by choice  The~ is another  and clearly distinguishable type of agriculturists who are referred to as  non cultivating owners of land   These are the people referred to as  raiyats  in raiyatwari villages  permanently settled zamindari villages and also other villages under certain varieties of miscellaneous special tenures  There are also the people who are called  tenants  in temporarily settled zamindari villages and villages under similar tenures  who possess a permanent and heritable right of occupancy in the land held by them for purposes of cultivation  Most of these people may cultivate their own land  in which case they are put in Livelihood Class I  Some of them who  for one reason or another  find it necessary or convenient to entrust the cultivation of their land to others on an undertaking to pay rent  would be agricultural rentiers temporarily  by voluntary decision and not by legal necessity  How many of each of these two types are included in the India total of 16 lakhs is not known definitely  But judging from their territorial distribution  there can be little doubt that the raiyat tenant type of rentier is much more numerous than the zamindar type • All of them  taken together  add up only to 2  3 per cent of all agriculturists and 1 6 per cent of all self supporting persons  8  Livelihood Classes I and II comprise all the cultivators  Livelihood Class III includes all the cultivating labourers  It is necessary clearly to grasp the fact that there is a distinction between the two  and appreciate precisely what the distinction is  This point is stressed because there ici a great deal of discussion about land reform  and one often finds that the words  kisan    peasant    tiller of the soil  and so forth are used  sometimes in a restrictive sense to  denote particular groups among agriculturists  often not the same groups  and sometimes the words are used as if they were synonyms for  agriculturists   It is so difficult to be sure about what is being proposed or opposed  The census figures distinguish the  cultivating labourer  as an employee of a cultivator  whose business merely is to perform physical labour in the manner required by the cultivator  The cultivator is the manager of cultivation  he is the person who decides how and when or where the various operations of cultivation should be undertaken  and who sees to it that they are properly undertaken  He is the person who accepts the risks of cultivation  The nature of • One of the pitflills for the unwary enquirers abcut llind tenure  is tlae fact the lame name meanl different things in different places and different names mean the same thing  ODe of these pitfalls i  the Ule of the word  zamindar·  It stands for someone in the Punjab and an altogether different t  pe oC person ia Bibar and Welt SenFI   94  \fINDIA PICTURE  the income obtained by these cultivators is quite different from that of the cultivating labourer  The cultivator gets the  net profits of cultivation   i e   what remains of the produce of the land after expenses are met  The cultivating labourer gets  agricultural wages   The livelihood of the cultivating labourer is part of the expenses of cultivation  There are  it will be observed  only I49lakhs of cultivating labourers against 545 lakhs of cultivators  very little more than one in five  This shows that the number of cultivators who employ cultivating labourers in addition to or in lieu of the labourperfonned by themselves and members of their families must be relatively small  9  Having thus distinguished cultivators from cultivating labourers  we make a further distinction among cultivators  one being put in Livelihood Class I and the other in Livelihood Class II  It would be simple and convenient to refer to these two classes as  owner cultivators  and  tenant cultivators   but great care was taken to avoid using these expressions at the census enumeration because they were liable to cause misunderstanding of the true nature of the distinction we sought to make  Our idea of  owner cultivator  is one which includes the  occupancy tenants  of Uttar Pradesh along with the  raiyats  ot the raiyatwari vHlages of Bombay and Madras and the  raiyats  of the pennanently settled zamindaris of Bihar  They are all  owner cultivators   because the term  owner   if it is legitimately applicable to any type of holder of cultivated land  must be applied to that person who has the right to remain in possession of it  use it for cultivation and bequeath it to his heirs for a like purpose  The use of the term  tenant cultivator  must be limited to cultivators who hold the land they cultivate  for a strictly limited period  and are not owners thereof in the sense explained above  There is one more reason wby the terms  owner cultivator  and  tenantcultivator   though apparently simple and convenient  were not used at the stage of enumeration  It is obviously possible that a person may cultivate at one and the same place some plots of land which are owned by him and other plots which be may have rented from someone else who owns them  In such a case  the test is  which of the two gives him the larger income  If the former  he is included in Livelihood Class I  If the latter  he is included in Liveli hood Class II  Now that we have explained the distinction clearly and the  e is no danger of the census going wrong because of confuSion of local names  we shall refer to Livelihood Class I or  cultivators of land wholly or ma in1y owned  88  9   \fcitAl TER 111   LiVEi ntOOD P A ri EtriJ 1 9~t  owner cultivators  and Livelihood Class II or  cultivators of land wh  lly or mainly un lJf lJ1U d  as tenant cultivators  There are 545 lakhs of cultivators  Among them  owner cultivators number 457 lakhs and tenant cultivators number only 88 lakm  The preponderance of  owner cultivators  is the most important and characteristic feature of our agricultural class structure  As we shall see presently this statement is true not merely of raiyatwari areas but it is true to an even greater extent of the permanently settled and temporarily settled zamiodari areas as well  10  We may now tum to the 334 lakhs of self supporting non agriculturists  and ascertain the manner in which they obtain their livelihood  be divided into four sections as below    They too may  TABLE 6  Percentage of all Percentage of all self supporting selj supf Number mm agriporting  IN LAKHS  culturists persons  Employers Self employed persons other than employers   Employees Non agricultural

people as  shown  below   i  Persons living principally on income derived from ownership  Of non  agricultural property   it  Persons living principally on pensions  remittances  scholarships and

\fwi  picii rR   The figures returned under some of these items are surprisingly small  But it should be borne in mind  first  that the figures relate only to self supporting persons and do not include their dependants  and secondly  that persons whose principal income is derived in some other way  but who may also derive secondary income in one or other of the ways mentioned above are not included  12  The low ratio  of  employers  stands out  They are only about one in hundred among all self supporting persons and rather less than one in thirty among all self supporting non agriculturists  This is all the more remarkable because the definition of employers was comprehensive and induded everyone who employed even one person  provided only that the latter was employed for purposes of carrying on the business or profession by which the employer earned his livelihood   No one was to be classified as an employer merely because he had domestic servants   As this is the first time when statistics of employees  other self employed persons and employers were collected  it is impossible to compare them with  previous figures  There is no good reason to suppose that any appreciable number of employers were wrongly included in any of the other sections   13  Non agricultural employees  it will be observed  form a distinctly larger proportion of non agriculturists than cultivating labourers among agriculturists  They are nevertheless a clear minority  Self employed persons  other than employers  are  on the other hand  more numerous than employers and employees combined  If we deduct rentiers from both sides  16 lakhc  from agriculturists and 10 lakhs from non agriculturists   we get the following classification of income earners with reference to the nature of the income earned by them  TABLE  7 Number  IN LAKHS  of Income earner  rIndustries Cultivation and services Total  Nature of Income  Net profits Wages and salaries TOTAL  545 149  176 148  1 91

cultivation and ascertain what exactly they do in order to earn their income  All industries and services other than cultivation have been grouped together into 10 divisions  and 88 subdivisions  Any grouping system is bound to appear somewhat arbitrary  but the system we are following has been carefully drawn up so as to satisfy two requirements as far as practicable  One is  that our statistics should be comparable with those collected in other C01Ultries under a scheme approved by the United Nations Economic and Social emmci   The other requirement is  that the 1951 Census statistics should be comparable with the published statistics of the 1931 and earlier censuses in India  The results of classification of the 324 lakhs of persons referred to above are shown in the table below TABLE 8

these divisions briefly  to see what sort of activities are included in each and their relative numerical importance  15  PRIMARY PRODUCTION  Divisions 0 and 1  The people who work on the land and produce food and all the raw materials of industries are  primary producers   By far the most important among them are those who work on cultivated land and produce field crops  We have seen already that their total number is 694 lakhs  The other primary producers number only 30 lakhsthough two separate divisions have been allotted for their classification  Plantation industries  This is the most important sub division in Division o  It accounts for 10 6 lakhs of people  or 44 2 per cent oftrus division  and includes all the workers in tea  coffee and rubber plantations  and in fact  all other kinds of plantations except the cultivation of such crops as sugarcane or betel  undertaken in conjunction with ordinary cultivation of field crops   Stock raising  This sub division accounts for 6 3 lakhs of people  or 26  3 per cent of this division   It includes all herdsmen and shepherds and those who breed or maintain herds of cattle  buffaloes and other large animals as their principal means of livelihood   The ordinary cultivator who makes a little extra income by cattle breeding is not  however  included here but shown ooder Li velihood Class I or II   Fishing  This sub division accounts for 4  2 lakhs of people  or IT 5 per cent of Division 0    Forestry  woodcutting and collection of forest produce not elsewhere specifiedThis accounts for 2  5 lakhs of people  or 10  5 per cent of  his division   A separate sub division was provided for  rearing of small animals and insects   This was intended to include poultry farmers  bee keepers  ~ilkworm rearers  cultivators of lac and so on  But the number returned was extremely small  only 27 thousand for the whole coootry   The rea c  on  no dOUbt  was that such activities provide only a  secondary  means of livelihood  Another sub division  provided for  hunting   also yielded an even smaller number  under 9 thousand   MINING AND QUARRYlNG  It is extraordinary how small a number of people are engaged on  mining and quarrying  over an entire sub con~ent  There is little doubt that the figures are substantially correct  They reflect the relative scarcity of known deposits of profitably workable minerals over a very large part of the COWltry  as well as the insufficiency of organised enter· prises in the few localities where there is no  such scarcity  Coal mining is by far the most imponant sub division within this division  It accounts for 3  I lakhs of peopJe or 54  9 per cent of all persoas mgaged in 99  \fCiiAh ER Iii  LiVELiHooD PATTERN  f9St mining and quarrying  An estimate of the relative money value of raw minerai output  which will be found among the papers in APPENDIX I  repre3ellts the money value of coal as being 58 9 per cent of the money value of all mineral productio n in India  Extraction from the earth of stone  clay  sand and other materials used in building or manufacture of cement  engaged I   2lakhs of people  or 21·5 per cent of this division   Other kinds of mining

MANUFACTURE  The workers in Divisions 2  3 and 4  all engag~ in   processing and manufacture number 92 lakhs  Three out of every five persons among them 22 are engaged in processing the 11 primary products of cultivation and animal husbandry  All of TOTAL 135 them are included in Division 2 which accounts for 55 laths and is divided into various sub  divisions as explained below   Grains and pulses  Milling of cereals and pulses  hand pounding of rice  manual dehusking and flour grinding  grain parching and similar processing of grains and pulses employ 4·0 lakhs of persons  of whom about half are women and a little under three quarters are living in villages  Vegetable oil and dairy products  There were 2·7 lakhs of people mostly males and mainly self employed  in villiges   About one lakh live in towns and the rest  Sugar industries  They provide a living for 1·4 lakhs of people  mostly males  About one third among them are self employed and two thirds are employees  About two thirds live in villages and one third in towns  BefJerages  The sub division includes brewers and distillers  toddy drawers and people who make aerated and mineral waters and ice  They number I· 6 100  \fiNDIA PICTURE  lakhs  mostly males and mainly self employed  and a very large proportion live in villages  The number  coWlted in towns was only 33 thousands  Tobacco  The sub division includes  not the growers of tobacco  who are counted among cultivators   but  those who prepare raw leaf tobacco for manufacturing  as also makers of bidis  cigarettes  cigars  cheroots and snuff  They number 3  6 lakhs  about five~sixths males  and nearly two lakhs live in towns  I   5 lakhs only are employees  the others are self employed   Other food industries account for I   8 lakhs  mostly males and mainly selfemployed  Roughly a lakh live in towns  All food industries  Altogether  therefore  we have apart from the cultivators who work in the fields and the housewives who mostly cook and serve the food   and not counting the people working in hotels and eating houses as well as cooks employed as domestic servants   a total of 15 lakhs of people who earn their living by processing the food  drink and tobacco consumed by other people  Cotton textiles  This important sub division includes cotton ginning  cleaning and pressing  spinning  sizing and weaving  dyeing  bleaching and printing  20  6 lakhs  of people earn a living from this industry  which means one out of every 16 persons engaged in all industries and services other than cultivation  Women workers are relatively small in number  2  3 lakhs   Nearly 12 lakhs live in towns and 9 lakhs in villages  The self employed workers nwnber nearly 13 lakhs and are more numerous than employees  Most of the former must be handloom weavers and most of the latter must be factory workers  Wearing apparel  except footwear  and made up textile goods  All tailors and dressmakers  makers of hosiery and embroiderers are included in this subdivision which accounts for 6  5 lakhs  mostly males  mostly self employed and rather more numerous in towns than in villages     01her textiles  There is another sub division which includes all textile industries other than the two mentioned above  This includes pressing  bailing  spinning and weaving of jute as well as spinning and weaving of wool  silk  hemp and flax  It includes rayon manufacture  it also includes manufacture of rope  twine  string and similar goods made from cocoanut aloes  straw  linseed and hair  • These numben might excite surprise and be re larded as tOO small

three divisions of industries which process and manufacture goods  consists of all those which are based on metals and chemicals  Division 3 had been provided for numbering them  but the total number in these industries is only 12  4 lakhs  Female workers are about half a lakh only  There are T 8 lakhs in towns and 4  6 lakhs in villages  Employees predominate  numbering 6  9 lakhs  A series of sub divisions which are very important in other countries had been provided but very few numbers tUrned up  the sub divisions with over a lakh were  manufacture of transport equipment  2  2 lakhs

products otherwise tlllclassified   6 2Iakhs    Other manufacturing industries  This is Division 4  which accotlllts for 24  3 lakhs  The most important sub division is the manufacture of wood and Carpenters  turners  joiners and basketwood products  10  4 lakhs   makers account for practically the whole of this number  Another important sub division proved to be the manufacture of non metallic mineral products  4  5 lakhs   This means mainly potters and includes makers of all earthen   ware porcelain  crockery  glass  glass bangles and glass beads etc  Out of the total of 24  3 lakhs of workers in this division as many as 17  3 lakhs were selfemployed persons and 15  1 lakhs lived in villages  Female workers numbered less than one in ten    This concludes our accotlllt of the 92 lakhs of self supporting persons who make their living out of processing and manufacture   17  CoMMERCE  We may next consider  Commerce  Division 6  which provides a living for 59 lakhs of workers

UTILITIES  Division 5  This accounts for 15 9 lakhs including 2  7 lakhs of female workers in villages and towns   Whereas the numbers are about equal in villages and towns  it should be borne in mind that the proportion of rural workers to the rural population will be very much smaller than the proportion of urban workers to the urban population  as the rural population is about five times as numerous as the urban population   The self employed persons number 8  4 Jakhs while employees are 7  I lakhs  This division includes all workers engaged in the maintenw1    C as well as new construction of buildings  roads  bridges  rail roads  telegraph and telephone lines  irrigation and other agriCUltural works  It also includes people employed on works and services which provide

known than that they are self supporting and earn their living by rendering some service or other  Fifteen lakhs among them are also known to have described themselves as  employees  and the others as  self employed persons   In some of these cases  it may be that the nature of their activity is clearly specifiable but has been left unspecified either inadvertently or unavoidably   Special efforts were made to reduce the number of such cases   In a large proportion of such cases  however  it might well be that they are people who are not conveniently classifiable and are multi purpose workers in a very genuine sense  There are 8 0 lakhs of these people who have described themselves as employees and who live in villages  It is not impossible that some of them are employed as cultivating labourers and failed to be recorded under Livelihood Class III  which includes 149lakhs of people   More probably  their participation in agricultural labour is not sufficiently regular or important and so they were rightly excluded from Livelihood Class III  It is  in any case  worth bearing in mind that there are 8 0 lakhs of employees and 14  5 lakhs of self employed persons living in villages about whom we know only that they earn their living by work  but we do not know what work they do  Turning to the 38  I lakhs of people for whom details are available  they are shown in TABLE 13 on

dependants  to  3 810  self supporting persons by means of  li lJelihood  We noted at the beginning of this chapter that within the total of  3 566 lakhs of people who were to be classified according to their means of livelihood  there were 2 143 lakhs of people classed as  non earning dependants  and another 379 lakhs of people classed as  earning dependants   We have seen in detail  the nature of the activities by which the remaining number   Vi••   1 044 lakhs of self supporting persons  earned their living and maintained themselves as well as others who depended on them for maintenance  It is important that we should know not only how many self supponing persons there are who earn a living from agriculture or from different branches of industries and services  but how mWly people in all are supported  including in this reckoning not only the self supporting persons but also their dependants  Such affiliation of dependants to self supporting persons by means of livelihood could not be carried out in great detaiJ  owing to the time and cost involved  but has been done under eight different heads  called  Livelihood Classes  as shown in TABLE 14 on next page   107  \fCHAPTER

self supporting persons together  The figures show that agriculture supports a slightly larger proportion of people than it provides self supporting employment fOf  Why this dHference  It is to be expected  because the number of dependants supported by a given number of self supporting persons is not exactly the same in all livelihood classes  The relevant numbers are computed and shown below

low figures for  cUltivating labourers  Livelihood Class III  and the high figures for  commerce   Livelihood Class VI  stand out  They suggest the presence of significant variatir us among diff  r~t soci aJ groups  10 9  \fCHAPTER III   LIV ELIHOOD PATTERN I9S1  It is probable that cultivating labourers have  in fact  the higher percentage of family members engaged in earning and living  It is possible that there are groups with even higher ratios of dependants to self supporting persons than in  oommerce   We might find them  if we could isolate specific professional service groups merged within Livelihood Class VIII · The broad position is clear  The average self supporting person uses his income to support himself  and at least l lDO others  Roughly Dn8 among three self supporting persons also provides  in addition  partial support for one earning dependant   B   Zonal Variations FIGURES similar to those set out in the last  section for India have been compiled for every zone  every state  every natural division and every district in each state  and for different rural tracts and urban tracts separately within each district  The totals for each of the eight livelihood classes are  indeed  furnished for every single village  and every town  and every ward  or mohallah  of every town separately  A review of these figures and comments on their significance will be found for each state in each state census report   A review for India has also been prepared and printed separately  APPENDIX III   The principal object of this review is to furnish a full account of the definitions and classifications adopted at this census  to compare them with those adopted at previous censuses and to bring out the differences and similarities clearly so that users of census data may be able to study them in relation to the data provided by prior censuses or by other  sources  The review also sets out the results of a preliminary study of similarities ana differences between different zones of India and also between India in 1951 and India in 1931  The main results of comparison between different zones are briefly set out in this section  The results of comparison between 1951 and 193 I will be referred to in the next chapter   26  We have seen that there is a three fold division among the peopleself supporting persons  29 3 per cent   earning dependants  10  6

coJumn showing the percmtages of selfsupporting persons we might be inclined to say that North   West India stand   first from the point of view of provision of gainful employment and South India comes last  and the order among the other zones is  East India  North I Ildia  Central India and West India  The differences are not very large  three per cent on either side of the all India average covers all the zones  If  for the same purpose  we follow the ascending order of percentages of the  non eaming dependants  we get South India last  again  but the first place is taken by Central India instead of North West India  The order among intermediate zones also alters and we have North West India  West India  North India and  after a long interval  East India  The quantitative differences between the zones are larger  we need about 9 per cent on either side of the all India average to cover all the zones  The difference in results between the two approaches is caused by wide variations in the percentage of earning dependants  Here again  we find South India to be the last in order  Centra  India comes first  One is nearly one half and the other is nearly double the aU India average  III  \fCHAPTER III   LIVELIHOOD PATTERN I95 I  These differences between one zone and another cannot be attributed to corresponding differences in age structure  For the latter differences are far too smal1  Judged by age structure alone  South India should head the list instead of being at the bottom   27  When we analyse the figures separately for men and women and for villages and towns  we find that the largest amount of variations occur in the classification of village women  This is seen from the table below   TABLE I7  Zone  Ratio between PcrcCIltage self

have the smallest ratios of village women who go out for field work or otherwise take some part in earning a livelihood for the family  the number is one in six in one case  and one in five in the other  It so happens that it is precisely in these two zones that the work of the women is rated high  Among the few who do work  the number classified as selfsupporting is twice as numerous as the ·number classified as earning dependants  II2  \fZONAL VARIATIONS  Central India and West India are the two zones where the exact opposite is observed  We have the highest ratios  roughly four out of ten in one case and four out of eleven in another  of women who go out for field work or otherwise take some part in earning a livelihood for the family  But at the same time they are a 80 the two zones where the contribution of women labour is rated lowest  Among these women  earning dependants are twice as numerous as self supporting women in one zone and four times as numerous in the other  The other two zones   North India and North  West India  fall in an intermediate category between these two extremes     What arc we to think of these variations brought to light by the census   It is probable that it is in fact a correct picture of how livelihood is earned and people are supported in diffcrrent parts of the country  There arc  apparently  substantial differences in the volume and nature of participation of village women in livelihood earning  The differences do probably reflect corresponding differences in conditions under which cultivation is carried on as well as differences in social habits and customs  At  he same time  it would not be safe to go further than that and maintain that the differences in the figures between different zones have been accurately measured by the figures obtained  It would be unsafe to dogmatise on this point because  simple as it may sound  there are real difficulties in securing that the line between self supporting persons and earning dependmlts is drawn at an identical level in all parts of a large subcontinent  To what extent do the different zones differ from one another in the extent to which gainful employment is actually available  If we arc to answer this question satisfactorily we should do two things   28   FirSl   We must leave the women out of the reckoning  Village women present a special problem of evaluation of their work  while women in towns play such a small part that they can be conveniently omitted along with village women   Secondly   We should have a rough and ready method by which caming dependants may be reckoned as a definite fraction of self supporting persons and then combined in a single category of  bread winners   Based on these ideas  we arrive at  male bread willller percentages  for the villages and towns of each zone separately  as the percentage of self supporting  113  \fCHAPTER III   LIVELIHOOD PATTEItN I951  persons plus one third of the percentage of earning dependants    The results  are shown in the table below   TABLE 18  Male bread winner percentages  Zone  Villages  Towns  North India  5S  S3  East India South India West India Central India

EMPLOYMENT IN VILLAGES  North India stands first  followed closely by North West India and Central India  East India and West India come next with a definitely lower bread  winner percentage  South

fairly close to one another  Theorder is   North India  West India  North West India and Central India   Thirdly   DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VILLAGES AND TOWNS  Towns provide more male employment than villages in the country as a whole and in East India  West India and South India  Villages provide more male employment than towns in North West India  North India and Central India   29  We have seen that the agricuJtural cIasses  that is to say  all the people who are supported by agriculture  including dependants  number 69  8 per cent of the population  This percentage also varies from one zone to another  East India stands first  75 6 per cent  and West India last  59 7 per cent   The percentages in other zones  in order  are   North India  74  2   Central India  73 2   North West India  66 0  and South India  64 3    30  The numerical insignificance of agricultural rentiers and their dependants  Livelihood Class IV  is clearly brought out in all zones  In the country as a whole  they are I  5 per cent of the general population and 2· I per cent of the agricultural classes   According to the latter mode of measurement  agricul   tural Tenliers aTe fewest  1·1 per cent  in Bast

other zones  in order  are  North India  1 4   Central India  2 3  and North West India  2·7    31  Cultivating labourer~ and their dependants  Livelihood Class III  are 12  6 per cent of the general population and 18  0 per cent of the agricultural classes  On the latter basis  they are fewest in North India  7 7  and most numerous in South India  26 6   The other zones  in order  are  NorthWest

India  12  4  and South India  13   5   It is not possible to fix the position of North West India satisfactorily because when the census was taken the proportion was temporarily swollen to the abnormal figure of 26  3 per cent   because of the mass migration which had taken place shortly before  A very large number of displaced persons who have since become  or will shortly become  owner cultivators are shown a  tenant cultivators because they had not yet been given permanent and heritable rights of occupancy In land   33  Owner cultivators and their dependants  Livelihood Class I  are 46  9 per cent of the general population and 67·2 pcr ct   I1t of the agricultural classes  Their preponderance among the agrkultural cJasses is clear in all the zones  The highest percentage occurs in North India  83  9  and the lowest in South India  56  6   The other zones  in order  are quite close to one another  West India  66  6   East India  66 ·2  and Central India  64 ·7   North West India with 63 0 per cent will probably go above all these three  if the temporary and abnormal feature mentioned above is allowed fOf   34  In the country as a whole  the relative proportion of cultivators  UveJihood Classei I and II  and cultiv2ting labourers  Livelihood Class III  is of the order of 82 cultivators to 18 cultiwting labourers   This proportion is an important indicator of the structure of agricultural  organisation and economic relations   lIS  \fLIVELIHOOD PATTERN  I 95 1  CHAPTER III   HIGH RATIO OF CULTIVATORS TO CULTIVATING LABOURERS  It is found that cultivators

Dry North West India Area   Punjab Plain being an abnormal and temporary addition to this group    36  In order to avoid misunderstanding it should be mentioned here that tcultivating labourers  of Livelihood Class III arc not necessarily all  hmdless agriculturists   Some of them do have land but so little that the wages they obtain from working for others is more important to them than the income from their own land  The same applies to Livelihood Class II alsosome of them have plots of land of their own  but they arc classified as tenantcultivators if the income from rented land exceeds the income from owned land  Contrariwise  the term  agricultural landholders  would include every one in Livelihood Classes I and IV  but would not be limited to them  It would 1I7  \fettAM E~ lIt   LIVELIHOOD PAtTE~N t95t  include every one  not only in Livelihood Classes II and III  but also among the non agricultural classes who had some permanent and heritable right in agricultural land  even though the income thus derived was less important than some other type  of income  With the help of infonnation collected at the census about secondary means of livelihood it has been possible to compute separate figures for agricultural landholders and landless agriculturists  These are shown in a statement annexed to the detailed review of census economic data  ApPENDIX III   According to this statement  there are 402 landless agriculturists jur every 1 000 agricultural landholders  There are enormous differences in this respect from state to state  This number  oj landless

with U S A   and Great Britain I T IS NOT easy to establish detailed comparison with other countries of the world in respect of the data reviewed ill this  chapter  This is so for a number of reasons  To begin with  there are little or no published data for a great many countries  Secondly  not all the available figures are in a comparable form  Thirdly  the economy of every large country is a complex affair and the problems involved in expressing it in quantitative terms which can be used for oomparison of different countries with one another cannot be said to have been solved satisfactorily  However  a few comparisons have been attempted in two aspects  where published figures seemed to permit such comparisons  with the United States of America and Great Britain  The results are set out in the diagram facing this page   38  The first aspect of the comparison refers to what may be called the  burden of dependency   If we consider 1 000 self supporting persons in

India  who are also gainfully employed   they support by their exertion  themselves as well  as 2 504 other persons  These include 373 persons who are earning dependants  in other words  only partially dependent on the 1 000 we are considering   and 26 rentiers and pensioners who  though not a burden on their own household  are nevertheless supported ultimately by the exertion of the 1 000 persons we are considering  In the United States of America the number corresponding to our 2 504 is only 1  547  In Great Britain it is even less  it is only 1 207  We do not know whether these numbers include any persons corresponding to our 373 earning dependants  and if so  in what number  We may  if we choose  ignore them altogether  as in the diagram   The difference in the burden of dependency is still very large  To a large extent  the difference arises out of the fact that we have a much larger proportion of infants  young children and grown up children under 15 than in United States or Great Britain  On the scale we are following  viz   1 000 self supporting and gainfully occupied persons  the number aged 14 or less is Idl7 in India  702 in United States and 496 in Great Britain  While this is an important part of the explanation  it is only a part  The diagram shows that even after this number is separated  the remaining burden of dependency is still heavier in India than in United States or Great Britain  The conclusion follows  even people of working age are less fully employed in India than in these countries  39  The second aspect of the comparison is the distribution of these 1 000 self supporting persons who are gainfully employed among the diffc   rent sectors of productive activity  The comparison is shown below  TABLE 19  India  U S A   Greal

  119  \fCHAPTER III   LIVELIHOOD PATTERN I95I  The numbers in Category A represent broadly the man power devoted to food production  The differences verge on the fantastic  In India 706 persons out of 1 000 are engaged in producing their own food and a small surplus which just falls short of being sufficient for the other 294  In United States 128 persons produce a surplus in excess of their own food requirements which not only suffices for the needs of the other 872 but yields a margin for export to other countries  In Great Britain a large majority of the people are fed by foreign producers of food  Even so  the allocation of only 50 to food production is astonishing  The differences in the numbers in Category B reflect broadly the differences in the extent of industrialisation of these countries  Together with the figures of Category C  they show the great differences that exist regarding the amount of goods and services other than food which the people of different countries have at their disposal  They mark the distinction between affluence and poverty   120  \fGrowth of Population    I  8g I   I goo  \fI I   ~O   00  Q en    I   I  ~~ UJ   C    I z ~o  0   ~   J ~  J   J J

INDIA  \fCHAPTER IV  Before and Since 192 I A   Growth oj population   checked and unchecked given in the last three chapters of the number and distribution of people on the land and the pattern of life and livelihood relates to 195I  But the picture does not remain the same  even for a day  it changes imperceptibly but nonetheless surely  and the rate of change has been quickening in recent decades  It is necessary that we should have a clear appreciation of how the picture changed in the past  and also in so far as it is possible to know this  why it changed as it did and not otherwise  If we succeed in gaining a correct and complete appreciation of the way in which the wheels of life have been turning in the past  we shall be able to peer into the future and form a correct opinion about the changes which are likely to come about in the future  The future  of course  is not totally determined by the past  Neither is it  as some are apt to suppose  simply day in our hands to be moulded as we may fancy  It lies within our power so to influence the course of events as to avert danger and promote welfare and happiness  but there are very definite limits to this power  Those who have the responsibility of governance have to distinguish between right and wrong action with reference mainly to these limits  The purpose of this chapter is to bring the past under review in such a way that the course of right action for the future may become at least a linle clearer than it is  P E PICTURK  As the census is taken at ten yearly intervals  OUT unit of time for the measurement of changes must be the decade  The minimum requirements for   review of changes must  therefore  be at least two decades before 1951  in order that the trend of change disclosed by two successive decades might give us an insight into the decade immediately following the 1951 Census  This js  however  not long enough  Though we live in a fast  moving world  we need to look back longer in order to gain a cle2T perspective  It is proposed in this chapter to review the changes which took place over six decades  three before and three after the 1911 Census  On the basis of th s review  it is suggested that an attempt should be made to visualise the prospect for 1981  2   121  \fCHAPTER IV  BEFORE AND SINCE 1921  As it happens  the choice of 1921 as the central year of the review period is nol merely convenient  it is a necessity  There is a profound difference between the trend of growth after that year and the trend of growth in preceding decades  Dry figures of the census which record the growth of the people acquire meaning and significance only when the sharp contrast between the decades before and since 1921 is clearly understood and constantly borne in mind   3  The Indian     ensus of 1891 was taken over a territory which comprised India of today as well as Pakistan and Bunna  The internal territorial divisions were very different  But the TABLE I figures of old censuses have been readjusted to the present limits and territorial divisions and the Increase     rea d jus ted figures have been decrease    during published  TABLE I shows the preceding growth in numbers of the people Number decade inhabiting the territory where the Census yeaT  IN LAKHS   IN LAKHS  1951 Census was taken  4  During the thirty years 4 • between 1891 and 1920 the number 1911 2 490  135 of the people increased by 122 Z 481 1921   9 lakhs  which is just a linle more 1931 2 755   274 than the number of peopJe living 3 128  1941  373 in the Pwljab Plain division or 3 569 19 5 1  44 1 the South Bihar Plain division and just 8 little less than the number of people living in the Northern division of Bombay Deccan  Dwing the ten years between 1921 and 1930 the number increased by 274 lakhs  that is to say  by much more than twice the increase which had occurred during the preceding 30 years  The addition to the population which took place during one decade was distinctly larger than the present population of West Bengal and not far short of the total number of people living in two major states  Rajasthan and the l1m jab combined  During the ten years between 1931 and 1940 the number increased by 373 lakhs  that is to say  by more than three times the increase which had occurred 1901   According to the 1941 cenlus count  this figure should be 3 148  It is necessary  however  to deduct Of returns in West Bengal and Punjab  Por a fuller account ofthi  deduction Bnd the reasonS for the view that the recorded figures of successive cenSU8eS are sufficiently accurate and comparable  reference may be made to paras 10 15 of ArPEDNIX II  20 lllkhs  al the estimated allowance for inflation  122  \fG~OWTH OF POPULATtON   CHECKED AN   uNCHECKE D  during the thirty years 1891 1920  This time  the size of the additional popu· lation exceeded the present population of Bombay state  It also exceeded the combined present population of all the North· WesT India states  During the ten years between 1941 and 1950 the increase has been much larger than during the previous decades  The addition to the population441 Jakhs  is larger than the combined present population of the West India states  It is larger than the present population of Bihar and not far short of the combined present population of West Bengal  Orissa and Assam   During the thirty years following 1921  our numbers have increased from roughly 25 crores to 36 crores  The addition  of about 11 crores  is almost exactly the number of people at present living in North India and Central India combined   or in South India and West India combined  5  When we pause and think of these figures and thdl  implications  the first reaction is one of wonder whether they could really be true  01 whether something has gone wrong with the figures somewhere  It seems so difficult to believe that 1921 50 could have been so very different  after ali  from 1891 411920  Though the number of people who are old enough to remember all about 1891 from personal experience must be quire small now  yer almost every person who is over forty can recaJl enough facts from persona  expenence which might induce him to distrust these figures  Reasoning based on common sense and personal experience would run on some such lines as follows    We know roughly how many children are born these days to womenfolk in OUT own families and friends   We also know the numbers born to the womenfolk of an older generation   our mothers and grand mothers  I t is true enough that our womenfolk do not practise contraception as they do in western countries and so may have more children  We need not quarrel with the figures given in an earlier chapter  they are probably correct  But then  this is norhing new  Our mothers and grandmothers did not praCTise contraception either  They bore as far as we can judge  just as many children  if not  indeed  more  So  it cannot be true that our numbers began to increase aU of a sudden because of any sudden change in the child bealing habits of our womenfolk  Well then  if we rule out a large incre ase of births  then we should assume a sensational decrease in the deaths to account for the contrast between the two thirty year periods  But has there been any such decrease    We have very grave doubts  There has  perhaps  been some decrease  It is true that hospitals and dis· pensaries have been springing up and doctors have increased in numbers  There are also the public health staffs  Something is being done about vaccination 123  \fCHAPTER IV  BEFORE AND SINCE 192%  and inoculation and the rest of it  New medicines are advertised and sold in shops  Granted all this  how much do they all am01 Ult to  And what difference has it made to the viUages of which we have personal know edge  Is it true that many more people are living longer  Where is the evidence  We can recall so many people of an older generation who lived long  In some ways  perhaps  they were a much hardier type than the present generation  No  there must be something wrong about these figures   The reasoning based on common sense and general experience is plausible  to some extent it is also correct  Yet the conclusion is wrong  There is no reasonable doubt that the startling differences in the numbers added to the population during the two thirty year periods are real  The explanation would be simple if we draw a distinction between what may be called  normal deaths  and  abnormal deaths   It is correct that child bearing habits have not materially changed  It is also correct that the incidence of normal deaths has slightly diminished  but not sensationally  The diminution in the incidence of normal deaths is wholly insufficient to account for the contrast between the JWo periods  The main explanation is that  abnormal deaths  used to claim a great many viCllms in the earlier period  They did not oecour or were prevented jrom occurring during the t lter period   6  Before we set out the evidence bearing on this explanation  let us follow the figures fUrther and examine whether the contrast we are discu~sing is observable in all parts of India or is localised  TABLE 2  IN LAKHS   Increase     Decrease      Number 1891  1921  1951  North India  479 563 426 263 359 269  467 628  632    12  90 1    65    165  273  57 254  75 6 40 7    91   239  373

should add the Lower Gangetic Plains whtre the increase was so small in relation to the population that the number 12~  \fCHAPtER tv  B £FORE ANn stt TCI 192t  may be regarded as having been practically stationary  There are thus eight sub regions where we counted in 1951 nearly 20 crores of people out of 36 crore     In 1921  there were only 14 crores of people while in 1891 there had been 141  a crores of people  The contrast between a decline of half a crore in the first thirty years and an increase of 6 crores in the next thirty years is unmistakable  Turning to the other seven sub regions where population had grown during the first thirty years  the acceleration of this growth during the second thirtyyears is unmistakable in every case without any exception  8  The population of India decreased by 0  2 per cent in 1891 1900  increased by 5 6 per cent  in 1901 10 and again decreased by 0 4 per cent in I 9 Il 20  On the other hand during TABLE 4 the three decades

contrast as shown in TABLE 4   9  If we analyse the figures of increase and decrease during 1891 1900 division by division and group the divisions according to the rates of increase or decrease recorded  the results are as follows   Increases were recorded in divisions representing two thirds of the country  on a population basis   The increase ranged between 5 per cent and 10 per cent over two fifths of the country  Higher rates of increase were recorded in very small areas  while lower rates of increase were far more common  The decreases occurred in the parts of the COWltry inhabited by a third of the people  The rates of decrease were very heavy  exceeding 25 per cent in Rajasthan Dry Area  Rajasthan Hills  Rajasthan Plateau  Madhya Bharat ·The rate of increase and decrease are expressed as percentages of the mean popUlation of the period during which the increase or decrease occurred   u6  \fGROWTH OF POPULATION  CHECKED AND UNCHECKED  Plateau  Madhya Bharat Hills  Bhopal and Bombay  Gu rat  Decreases ranging between 15 and 20 per cent occurred in Saurashtra and North Hyderabad  between  10 and 15 per cent in Ajrner  Kutch  Vindhya Pradesh  North West Madhya Pradesh and East Madhya Pradesh  between 5 and 10 per cent in East Rajasthan Plain  Uttar Pradesh Hills   Plateau and the Northern division of Bombay Deccan  and less than 5 per cent in South West Madhya Pradesh  East Uttar Pradesh Plain  South Bihar and Himalayan Punjab  10  The principal reason for these decreases during the decade 189I I900 must be found in the very severe famines which are known to have raged in the greater parts of these divisions during the decade  The following reference to these calamities is extracted from the 1901 All India Census Report    In 1891 92 there was scarcity over a considerable area in Madras and Bombay and in parts of Bihar  In r895 a weak monsoon led to extensive crop failure in the Bout hem districts of the United Provinces  and a sudden cessation of the rains of 1896 resulted in famine in the United Provinces  the Central Provinces and Berar and parts of Madras  Bombay  Bengal  the Punjab  Upper Burma  Rajputana  Central India and Hyderabad  Altogether an area of about 300 000 square miles with a population of nearly 70 millions was affected and on the average  two million persons were relieved daily during the twelve months from October 1896 to September 1897  the number rose to more than 4 million at the time of greatest distress   In 1899 the monsoon again failed  and the results were even more disastrous  for though the population affected was slightly les~ than in 1896 97  famine conditions prevailed over an area mlf 8S great again and with less easy means of communications  the drought was much more severe  the people had not yet recovered from the previous visitation  the mortality amongst cattle from want offodder and water was far heavier  and the tracts which suffered most lay for the greater part in Native States  where the relief organisation was necessarily less perfect than in British territory  In the height of this famine there were for weeks together over six million persons in receipt of relief  and the value of the agricultural production of the year was estimated to have been 60 millions sterlingbclowthe average  there was also a loss of some milliom ofcattle  It is impossible to say with any pretence to accuracy what was the actual mortality caused  by these ca1amities  The Commission of 1901 thought that about a million deaths were attributable to the famine of IB99 1900 in British territory  and it would probably be safe to assume that another three millions must have occurred in the Native States  which contained more than three fifths of the population afflicted and where the relief operations were generally far less successful  No estimate has been made of the excess mortality in 1896 97 but it cannot have been much less than 8 million  The total motality due to the two famines may therefore be taken roughly at five millions  The diminished vitality of the people resulted also in a heavy fall in the birth rate  but this was to some extent counter balanced by an unusually high rate of reproduction when the people had recovered their normal conditions    Vivid accOlmts of the impact of these famine conditions in many parts of India  notably Bombay  Berar and the Central Provinces  are fOlWd in 127  \fCHAPTER IV   BEFORE AND SINCE Ig21  other extracts from census reports which are printed among the papers in ApPENDIX IV  1 I  Another cause of heavy mortality during the decade was plague   Excluding a small tract in the Himalayas where it has long been endemic  bubonic plague made its first appearance in India in modem times in Bombay City in September 18g6 and after spreading over the Western Presidency  notwith· standing the measures taken to prevent its dissemin at  on  gradually extended its ravages to other parts of India  By the date of the  census the recorded mortality was nearly half a miJlion  to which Bombay contributed seven tenths and Bengal two thirds of the remainder  Mysore with 33 73 I reported deaths had suffered heavily in proportion to its population and so too had Baroda and Hvderabad  The extent to which the actual number of deaths ex eeded that reporh d is uncertain  but it if  known that the difference was very consi· derable and it may lY assumed that the true mOl talley from plague was not less than three quarters of a million and may possibly have been a million    This brief accoWlt is supported by several rderrnC  S in local census reports describing the ravages of plague in different pan8 of the country and assessing their effect it  arresting the growth of numbers  Some parts of the country  e g   Bihar  were vtsited by both famine ar d plague at the same time  The figures disclosed  even after full allowance for errors and uncertainties  an unmistakable stagnation of the rate of growth  The reports contain a detailed discussion and some difference of opinion as to which was the more effective check  One report cites a series of comparative figures tending to show that plague was the real killer and not famine  it seemed that the decline of population was closely correlated to the knOMl severity of the incidence of the  plague  while there was not only no decline  but some modest increase in areas where famine was knoMl to have been severe  According to a different view it is  extremely probable that the reduction in the rate of increase of the population is very largely due to a decline in the birth rate induced by the general rise in the price of staple foodgrains         In South Bihar  common rice is dearer by 26 per cent  maize by 32 per cent and whf at by 29 per cent  while during the same period the wages of agricultural J abourers have fallen by 3 per cent  Conditions such as th~e can hardly fail to affect the reprcductive energy of the large class of unskiUed labourers who own no land and have not pani· cipated in the profits arising from the enhanced prices of agricultural produce  Nor are they confined to South Bihar  They  extend in varying degrees to all parts of Bengal and although their influence on the birth rate may not always be trdceable  we may be sure that it is there   128  \fGROWTH OF POPULATION  CHECKED AND UNCHECKED  12  While famine and plague raged over very extensive areas there are also  references to the localised deadliness of epidemics of malaria  kala ·azar and other fevers  Thus  in the United Provinces  excessive and badly distributed rainfall in the early years of the decade  led to a severe outbreak of malarial fever which in 1894  raised the death rate to an exceptional height and sapped the vitality of the people to such an extent that the biIth rate in 1895 was unusually low   In Western Bengal  the natural growth was normal in areas which WEre  recovering from  J cycle of m 1Jaria  bU1 it was only l  4 per cent in Hoo~hly  whtre fever is rife and the popuJatirn would have been stationary but for the influence of the mills and factories of Serampur   In Assam   kalaazar entered Kamrup and reduced the popUlation of the southern part of the district by nearly 12 per cent  Having spent its force there  it pa   scd on in 1892 to Nowgong where its tract is marked by deserted villages  un tilled fields  a land revenue reduced by 23 per cent  and a disheartened population which after 19 years of steady increase has now receded to the figure at which it stood nearly 30 years ago   13  During the next decade  I901 1O  the seasonal conditions were much more favourable  The local census reports refer frequently to  agricultural conditions  being  normal  or  prosperous   Droughts appear to have visited their usual haunts in the brown and yellow bclts  followed by scarcity  sometimes even by famine  There is also an isolated reference to crop failure jn the Coastal division of Orissa  But the days when people died in large numbers because of local crop failures  seemed to have been ended  To farcsee the approach of scarcities and famines  to take measures to prevent or mitigate their actual incidence  and to organise and administer relief so as to save life with certainty and yet do it economically  all these tasks had been accepted  learnt and reduced to routine administrative operations  The reports of this decade contain no suggestion of mortality or other ill effects ansmg out of famine  But there were other checks on the growth of population  The reports show clearly that plague was continuing to take even heavier toll than in the previous decade   The mortality from it rose from about a quarter of a million in 190I to I  3 millions in I907  It fell below a quarter of a million in each of the next two years  but in 1910 it exceeded half a million  The total number of deaths from plague during the decade was nearly  6  5 millions  of which over one third occurred in the Punjab and two fifths in the United Provinces and Bombay taken together  The disease fortunately has failed to establish itself in Bengal  Assam and on the East Coast and in the extreme south of the peninsula  This  moreover  is only the recorded mortality  As is well known  when epidemics are raging the reporting agency breaks down and a large  129  \fCHAPTER  IV  BEFORE AND SINCE 1921  number of deaths escape registration  The omissions are most numerous in the Native States  where registration is usually far less accurate than in British territory   Plague was not the only killer during the decade   Epidemics of malarial fever decimated the irrigated tracts of the Eastern and Central Punjab and the Ganges Jumna Doab in the United Provinces  where  in 1908 alone  the reported mortality from fevers was nearly two millions   The reference in these cases is not to the areas where the disease is endemic  but to outbreaks of the disease in epidemic form  A report from the United Provinces explains that the  malaria epidemic appears to have made most headway in those districts where the disease is not as a rule specially prevalent and least in those in which it is in a high degree endemic   14  The differences in conditions  thus described  between the two decades is reflected in the pattern of growth  Whereas in the earlier decade increases were recorded in two thirds of the country  they occurred during this decade in about three fourths of the country  Areas in which the increase exceeded 10 per cent contained only 4  3 per cent of the population in the earlier decade  they contained 26  4 per cent of the population in the later decade  The area in which decreases occurred  was limited to three divisions of Uttar Pradesh  the Punjab  the Patiala and East Punjab States Union and the Southern division of Bombay Deccan  In the country as a whole  population grew from 2 355 lakhs to 2 490 lakhs  IS  The next decade  19II 20  was extraordinary in many ways  The opening year was unhealthy a sharp increase in attacks and deaths from plague  cholera and malaria occurred in widely different parts of the country   Then for five years  there were good seasons and good crops and public health was much better  The first world war began and ended  The last three years of the decade turned out to be deadly  Economic disorganisation  the aftermath of war  coincided with two successive bad seasons and extensive crop failures  Plague and cholera resumed their sway  Assam reported a recrudescence of  kala azar   In Bengal  malaria was specially severe throughout the period  which was characterised by a low birth rate and a mortality which in several districts steadily exceeded the births   But all these misfortunes paled into insignificance  when a world wide epidemic of influenza swept the COWltry from one end to the other in two waves  one closely following the other  A full account of this terrible visitation will be found among the papers printed in  ApPENDIX IV  The account includes a  conservative estimate  of the mortality at  between 12 and 13 millions for India  a large part of which occurred in the space of three or four months   13 0  \fCROWTH OF POPULATION  CtrECKED AND UNCHECKED  In general  the coastal areas escaped with a Jaw mortality  So also East India  Uttar Pradesh  Punjab  Bombay and Madhya Pradesh suffered heavily  The rural areas were most severely infected   the reason probably be ng that while villages have no advantage over towns in the matter of overcrowding  sanitation and ventilation  the urban areas have the benefit of qualified medical aid and organised effort    The pattern of growth during the decade 19II 1920 reflected the conditions thus described  There was an overall decrease from 2 490 laklls in 191I to 2 481 lakh~ in 1921  In the two earlier decades the divisions in which decreases had occurred were one third and one fourth of India  on a population basis   In this decade  decreases occurred in divisions which contained more than onehalf of the total population of India  Even where increases occurred they were small  the divisions where increases exceeded 5 pcr cent represented only about one tenth of India  The natural checks which restrain the growth of population were seen at their worst during this decade  16  ~re now reach the turning point  We hear no longer about abnormal deaths  until we come to the Bengal Famine of 1943  Already  as mentioned before  fam ne had lost its terror  In 1921  the Censu~ Commissioner wrote   Famine relief organisation is now so highly perfected in India that scarcity is not necessarily accompanied by high mortality   His successor in 1931 could say   There has  however  been no serious famine in the decade under review              Improvements in communications  nowaday~ prevent anything like the famine mortality of a century ago         Famines were local and not very serious  though one unfortunate district of Madras had famine declared in it officially for three seasons    It was not merely the fruits of victory over famine that the country was enjoying  A new note of confidence in the fight against epidemic diseases was beginning to be heard  According to the 1931 Census Report   Every year sees improved methods of fighting such epidemics as cholera  plague  or kalaazar  Indeed  a completely effective treatment for the latter pest has been perfected since the last census  and has made it possible to stamp out the disease   Detailed accounts of the course of the seasons and conditions of public health during the last and earlier decades are given in state census reports published separately  They need not be recounted here  Though the usual cycles of vicissitudes of the seasons continued and the brown and yellow belts of the country continued to suffer from droughts which caused severe scarcities and sometimes famines  there was no extraordinary  13 1  \fCHAPTER IV  BEFORE AND SINCE 1921  calamity  except the Bengal Famine of 1943   By about 1921  the freedom movement acquired a genuinely national character  and the British Government were carrying out reforms which culminated in the transfer of power in 1947  There was a conscious effort to develop  nation building  services and a spun of activity occurred in the  transferred  departments which dealt mainly with public health and education  For a few years before the outbreak of World War II  when Provincial Autonomy arrived and popular ministries took charge of Provincial Governments  further advances were registered  In the result  the organisation of public health establishments has been steadily strengthened and their methods of combating epidemic diseases  especially through control of fairs and festivals  have become increasingly efficient  Mention has been made already of the distinction between outbreaks of malarial fever in the form of epidemics and their perennial prevalence in many parts of the country where the disease is endemic  An attack on the latter problem gathered momcntwu during the last decade  I t seems likely  that in these areas the death rate must have been consistently higher and the birth rate consistently lower than elsewhere  Though the data are not conclusive there are indications to the effect that the lethal effects of endemic malaria were getting progressively reduced during the last thirty years and this progress has been substantially accelerated during the last decade   17  We may now go back to our question  Are the figures really true and our answer that they are  There is no doubt that during the thirty years before the 1921 Census severe checks of one kind or other were in operat on which tended to incre lse deaths abnormally  Such checks also had the effect  in some cases  of diminishing the births abnormally  The natural checks on population growth fall into three groups as below  z  Famines  including famine diseases   ii  Epidemic diseases  and  iii  Endemic diseases  These three groups of natural checks were responsible for keeping the  mean decennial 1ate of growth  during the first thirty year period as low as I   7 per cent  and actually bringing about a reduction of population in three zones out of six  Even during 1891 19°0  when the first of these checks  viz   famines  including famine diseases  were at their height  human intelligence was already devising and perfecting the counter checks by which the natural checks could be prevented from operating  These counter checks comprised  First  the creation of conditions in which the development of agricultural production would be both possible and profitable and take place of its own accord  Secondly

famine and thereby ensure the availability of commercial supplies of food grains   and Thirdlv  the organisation of efficient administrative arrangements for provision of employment and wages to the landless rural people in those places and at those times when prolonged and severe droughts occurred and they were unemployed and without purchasing power  So much for the counter checks on one group of natural checks  The counter checks devised for dealing with the other natural checks are more obvious  They consisted of hygiene and medicine brought to bear on the problem through departments of public health  and the gradual growth in numbers of the medical profession  There can be 110 doubt that  he counter checks proved effective and succeeded in eliminating the operation of one of these natural checks and materially diminished the incidence of olhers   I8  It would  however  be an excessive claim to attribute the whole of this improvement to human intelligence  Nature also seems to have heen kindlier  Some statistics compiled by the Meteorological Department  which are shown in the diagram facing this page appear to show that as between the two thirtyyear periods under study  the earlier period was worse favoured by nature than the later one  Droughts were clearly more frequent and more widespread In the earlier period  The difference is also reflected in the occurrences of excessive rain which not only cause floods but help to start outbreaks of epidemic diseases  19  The Bengal Famine of 1943  as is well known  marked a tragic reversal of this trend towards elimination of abnormal deaths  The circumstances in which this reversal took place are recorded in the report of a statutory Commission of Inquiry  Relevant extract   from the report of this Commission will be found in ApPENDIX IV  Notwithstanding the very full account given in this report  there is very Lttle public realisation of the fact that the occurrence of this famine marks a new phase in the effort to combat famine in this country  A basic assumption underlying the classic methods of prevention and relief of famine has been the presence within the country  which formerly included not only India and Pakistan but Burma also  of an overall surplus of foodgrains  The presence of this surplus was a guarantee  that commercial supplies of foodgrains would become available at  any place and at any time in the quantities needed  A physical shortage of supplies was not a contingency to be I~3  \f   CHAPTER IV  BEFORE AND SINCE 1921  I  guarded against  So long as the basic assumption remained valid  the old methods which were designed merely to inject purchasing power proved successful in saving life  But the growth of population  induced in part by the success of these very methods  has brought t he country and the people face to face with a new situation in which this assumption is no longer valid  The implications of this change are far reaching  Let us note that fact  we shall revert to it later  20  We may conclude This section with a comparison of the rates· of population growth experienced in India with those of other countries of the world and other times  The  mean decennial growth rate  in India  as already explained  was 10  4 per cent in 1921 30  12 7 per cent in 1931 40  and 13 2 per cent in 1941 50  The last mentioned rate is the difference between a  mean decennial birth rate  of 40 per cent and a  mean decennial death rate  of 27 per cent   The  mean decennial growth rate in thr United States of America appears to have been 19 0  19 10   13 9  19 2 0   14 9  1930  TO  1940  and 13 5  1950   In the United Kingdom  the rate was 9 6 between 40 and 50 years ago and 4  4 during the last twenty years  Recent figures for France indicate a decline  increases were registered during 1921 30 at the rate of about 6 per cent  The figures for Italy yield rates in the neighbourhood of 6  7 or 8 per cent for several decades  The rates for Japan appear to be running consistently higher than the rates for India  in lhe neighbourhood of 14 per cent  In general  Western European rates of growth are distinctly lower than in India even though their death rates arc lower than in India  This is due to the fact that Western European peoples practise contraception and thus succeed in keeping the birth rate at a much lower level than ours  though  if they imposed no such checks  their womenfolk are likely to have at least as many children as our womenfolk do have  In the United States of America the people practise contraception  But their birth rate  though distinctly lower than in India  is higher than in Western European countries  Their death rate is very low  In the result  they are keeping up a rate of growth similar to ours and much higher than in Western European coum ries   It is necessary  if possible  to ascertain how the present total strength of mankind has grown  in order to  determine whether there is such a thing as a  natural  rate of growth  As might 21  This is the position in recent years   ·While great care has been taken to work out these rates from authoritative sourcei  their accuracy cannot be guaranteed in all cases  The decimal points Ire rcfinement~ which mean very little  the integers may not  be too far out   134  \fGROWTH OF POPULATION  CHECKED AND UNCHECKED  be expected  we have very little statistical information of the kind we have been discussing so far  Yet  we are not entirely ignorant on the subject  there are a number of books where the results of expert study of all available data about world population are set out  It is true that much of this study consists of piecing together fragmems of ascertained fact with a good deal of guesswork  But the guess work is not arbitrary  it represents the best judgment of scholars who are well qualified to form an opinion and also free from conscious bias  A brief summary of relevent information of this nature is given below  Round about 1750  the total strength of mankind consisted only of 73 crores of people  Our own numher  it will be recalled  is 36 crores tuday   Thus lWO hundred years ago  the whole world contained only twice as many human beings as there are in India alone today  Out of these 73 crares  only lI ~ crares lived in what was then a New World  America and Oceania   71  2 crores of people lived in the Old World  ~8 crores in Asia  14 crores in Europe  and 91 l crores in Africa  Fifty years later  about 1800   the world population had increased to something between 90 and 91 crores  This was a modest rate of growth  only 4·4 per cent per decade  The New Wor1d was growing fastcr  the rate was 12·4 per cent mainly because its growth was being fed by migration from Europe  Asia and Europe grew by 4·5 and 5 7 per cent respectively  It is worth noting that even then  Europe was sending migrants to the New World and yet growing slightly faster than Asia Africa was not increasing  there was in fact a slight decline in numbers  Fifty years later  about 1850  the population of the world was nearly II7 crores  the rate of growth was 5  I per cent per decade  The New World was growing more than three times as fast  15·5 per cent per decade  The tempo of European growth was getting faster  it was now TO per cent against Asia s 4·4 per cent  Mrica  too  was beginning to add to its population  though at a very slow rate  I· g per cent  After another fifty years  about 1900   the population of the world was 161 crores  The rate of growth shows a definite sign of acceleration  the world average rate was now 6·3 per cent per decade  It is  however  still the New World and Europe moving ahead  the former was growing at the rate of 16·S per cent per decade and the latter at 8·1 per cent  Asia stayed behind w th 4·5 per cent  but Africa had now caught up to that rate  When the present century opened  the distdbution of world population had changed as shown in TABLE 5 on next page  135  \fCHAPTER IV  BEFORE AND SINCE I921 TABLE  5 1 7   0  1900           Number Percentage                   IN a world CRORES  popu alion  Country  Number Percentage  IN

and the New World had grown from heing about onefifth of the world i l pdHlion in 1750 to about one third in 1900  The population of Asia i md  A Ji iea htld also grown in ~bsolute numbers  but since their rates of growth were so much slower than in Europe and the New World  their relative proportion diminished  from about four fifths to two thirds  This was the position in or about 1900  During the last fifty years the practice of contraception has grown  and become part of the normal mode of conjugal life among the majority of the people in Western Europe and people of their stock inhabiting the New World  As a result  their birth rates have been falling fast  Their death rates had already begun to fall much carlier during the lust century  This was the result partly of the fact that the masses of the people had begun to eat more food and better food than they had ever known bdlm    and partly of the fact that water supply and sanitation  hygiene  So long as the birth rates and medicine had begun to make progress  remained sationary while the death rates fell  the growth rate was well ahead of the rest of the world  Hence the difference in the figures of Asia and Europe already observed  But when the European peoples started contraception and the habit grew  the birth rates fell faster than the death rates  with the result that the European rate of growth has been falling  During the last half century the mean decennial growth rate of Europe has been 6  0 per cent per decade  while that of Asia is higher  viz   6 8  Mrica has forged ahead with 9  3 while the rate in the New World has dropped from 16 8 to IS    The latest position  round about 1950  seems to be as follows  World popUlation is now 239 crores  well over three times the number of 175 0   Europe and the New World have about 88 crorcs which is well over a third of  136  \fGROWTH OF POPULATION  CHECKED AND UNCHECKED  the population of the world  Asia and Africa have 151 crores which is well below two thirds of the population of the world  If the trends of the last fifty years continue to operate during the next fifty years  the numbers of the European peoples should become stationary  if not declining  and Asia ~U1d Africa should keep growing even faster than at prcscnt  the rate of growth in the New World falling to the same level  But  there are good reasons to think  as will appear later in this report  that the  1   is a very big onc  and the assumption is Wllikely to hold good  22  In the account given above  it has been asserted that the decline during  the latest half century of the rate of growth of  Vestcm European peoples and people of the same stock in the New World  which is an observed fact which admits of no doubt  has been caused by the development of the practice of contraception  Until recently  this statemcnt  though widely suspected to be probably truc  could not be regarded as firmly established by adequate evidence  During the thirties  a theory was in VOhTUC   that the observed f  lH in the birth rate was a biological phenomenon  independent of conscious human volition  There was  it was asserted  a law of nature which induces a fall in the birth rate among people who achieved rising standard~ of living  l~vcn now one still comes across 1his idea  in some fOfm or other  But it is no longer necessary to invoke an unproved biological law in order to explain something which needs no further explanation  if the practice of contraception can be demonstrated to be both widespread and effective  This demonstratjon is now available  The Royal Commission on Population in the United Kingdom has collected and analysed a mass of evidence and the findings of that Commission are conclusive  Relevant extracts from the papers of this Commission will be found in ApPENDIX VII  The findings of the Commission confirm  what is also indicatcd by a good many other enquiries conducted in the Vnitcd SWtes of America and certain Western European countries  that the practice of contraception by sufficiently large numbers of people is the main operative cause of falling births f ltC o    They also indicate that the alleged biological law is wllikcly to be true illld that an improvement of the nutritional standard or other standards of living is by no means incompatible with the maintenance of a high rate of chjld bearing  if the people so desired  23  One more comment is necessary on the figures showing the rate of growth of population in different parts of the world  It may be agreed that an increase of population of the order of between 10 and 15 per cent per decade is biologically natural and has been experienced by many of the advanced countries of  137  \fCHAPTER IV  BEFORE AND SINCE 1921  tbe world and is still experienced by some of them  Whether Of not this can continue inde1initely in future is a question of high importance for mankind as a whole  The question is at present involved in acute controversy into which we need not enter at this stage  One thing  however  is certain  It could not have been a normal characteristic of human history for an indefinite period in the past  Within the laljt two hundred years mankind has more than trebled its numbers  and this has happened while the rate of growth per decade was very much lec  s than 10 per cent  We can easily see that even the rate which actually prevailed during the last two centuries  trebling in two centuries  must be regarded a    abnonnal and very much faster than in preceding centuries  On any other supposition  we must be led to the conclusion that  when Emperor Asoka ruled  273 232 RC    and was sending his missionaries to various countries of the world  the whole of mankind must have numbered only a few tens of thousands  which is absurd  We shall not sec the picture of human growth in its proper perspective unless we realise that what we feellO be a  biologically  natural  rale of growth is by no means natural in the sense of having re  ularly occurred at all places from time immemorial  The exact opposite is nearer the truth  The rates of growth which we are discussing should  therefore  be regarded as an episcde in an altogether exceptional epoch in human history  This epoch is probably now drawing to its close  With this observation  we may leave the world figures alone for a willIe  imd return to India and limit ourselves again to a review of changes which occurred during a much shorter period  viz   thirty years before and since 1921   B   Decline oj Cultivation per capita  THE OBJECT of this section is to analyse the growth of population durin g the last sixty years in relation to the growth of cultivation during the same period It is  nowadays  generally agreed that cultivation has been failing to keep pace with population  but the extent of this default has not bt    en assessed quan itative1y  So long as the matter remains vague  there is a tendency to refrain from facing or accepting the implications of that fact  and it is not unusual to find people denying the fact altogether  when they find its acceptance leads to unpalatable conclusions  13 8  \fDECLINE OF CULTIVATION PER CAPITA  lS· It is not the least difficult among many baffling problems which Governme~t~ have to face in J eeent years  that they are frequently obliged to make

consequently inconclusive for purposes of resolving differences of opinion objectively  In the result  there is great temptation for people to believe the facts to be what they would like them to be  Contrary to general belief  this situation is not peculiar to India  It is prevalent  to a greater or lesser degree  in every country in the world  In general  the change over from laissez fairc to economic and social planning has been too rapid for the statistical systems adequate to the former  being satisfactorily developed and adapted to meet the needs of the latter  These difficulties should be neither underrated nor overrated  They merely mean that we have to grope our W~ly for a time  bcfi re we improve the system of statistical intelligence adequately  It is not as if it   For is altogether impossible to find the right way even in our semi darkm Ss  this purpose  we can and should make much better use of the statistic~ which we possess and which we can increasingly procure as we go along facing and solving our problems  In particular  we 5hould do well to refrain from indiscriminate self condemnation just a  c  much as uncritical laudation  Strange as it may seem  it is true that in some respects we are even better equipped with good statistics than a great many other countries of the world  In other respects  much improvement can be secured merely by a systematic endeavour critically to assess the degree of goodness and badness of our statistics  and effecting careful separation of the grain from the chaff   26  These preliminary observations of a general nature are necessary in order to introduce the data relating to  population and land use  which are printed  as ApPENDIX I   An introductory note will be found among these papers where a full explanation is given of the ~ources from which the data were secured  the care taken to scrutinize and sift them  and the extent to which useful and reliable data are in fact available  Statistics of land and of its cultivation are of a  c  great importance as statistics of the people and their hirth  death and growth  Cultivation statistics fall into two parts  those relating to acreages and those relating to yields  Just ao   our census statistics are of better quality than our statisics of births and deaths  so also our statistics of cultivated acreages are very much better than our statistics of the yield of crops  Not all parts of the country arc equally weU equipped 139  \fCHAPTER IV   BEFORE AND SINCE 1921  with good acreage statistics  It can  however  be said that over the greater part of India acreage statistics are probably as good as the very best in the world  Among the areas for which acreage statistics of good quality are available  not all possess a continuous series over a sufficiently long period of years  It is  however  possible to select the areas for which comparable statistics of good quality arc procurable for the sixty year period with which we arc concerned in this chapter  The figures which are now to be presented relate to areas which were selected solely from this point of view and no other   27  Districts under sLUdy  The figures relate to all the districts of eight natural divisions and some of the districts of five other divisions  Nearly 12 crores of the people of India live in this territory  and their distribution by zones is gi

capita   ALL AREAS   It is generally knO vn that the net area of land on which some crop or other is raised  fluctuates from year to year   increasing when the rainfall is adequate and timely and decreasing when it is inadequate or untimely  In order to obviate or at any rate reduce the errors which would arise hy comparing good years with bad ones  the average area of cultivated land during a consecutive period of five years next preceding each census year has been computed   It is found that the area of cultivated land in the districts which we are studying was 890 lakhs of acres in 1891  It tell to 840 lakhs in 1901  thus reflecting the effects of the famines we have noted already  and then rose to 9I~ l40  \f~  5 ctll      CJ~ I  UJ  Q   III  ZZ  2 0 Ill  ~~     0   i       a cn

in 1921 943 lakhs in 193 I  958 lakhs in I941 and 991 lakhs in 1951  If we divide the area of cultivated l md by the population at each censuswe obtain a figure showing the  area of cultivated land pcr capita   If this figure remains the same from census to census  then the increase in the area of cultivated land has kept pace with the increase of population  If it fell from census to census  then it me   ans that the former is not keeping pace with the latter  and  other things being equal  the share of l    d and other produce of cultivation available to each individual is diminishing

to 332 lakhs in 193 I  rose to 346 lakhs in 1941 and then by a further big spurt rose to 362 lakhs in 1951  Having regard  generally  to the progress of cultivated acreages  thi   was goad gl ing  nut

The trend in the four different divisions of this zone is shown in TABLE 7  It will be observed that the area of TABLE 7 culti vated land per capita was Area of cultivated land slightly higher

South Madras  even though the areas involved are very large and excellent acreage statistics are available for them  and even though the remaining areas are not quite typical of South India as a whole  But the omission was necessary because zamindari villages lie interspersed with raiyatwari villages in most of these districts and they did not acquire proper statistics until after 191I  So the districts under study comprise only a population of 300 lakhs  against the zonal total of 756 lakhs  The coverage is relatively small and  as indicated already    not altogether typical of South India  Such as they are  the figures yield the following story  The area of cultivated land was 186 lakhs of acres in 1891  It rose to 1 92 lakhs in 1901   It will be recalled that the famines of the last decade  I891 I900  were not severely felt in this part of India  Some of these areas had suffered severely in a still earlier decade and one  lying in the brown beJt  is accustomed to droughts and failure of crops recurring at more or less regular intervals    The rise continued to 204 lakhs in I9II  Then there was a drop to 2021akhs in 1921  followed by a rise to 209lakhs in 193I  This again rose to 210 lakhs in 194I and dropped to 204 lakhs in I951  It appears that cultivation had become virtually stationary at the 200 lakhs acre level  such changes as occur represent only the fluctuations of the seasons~ It is noteworthy that both in 1931 and in 194I  the five year average should be somewhat bigberthan in I951 and I921  In both of these terminal periods there are well authenticated reports of an abnormal succession of seasons of inadequate rain   IS  c~pita  MADRAS MYSORE   A stationary level of cultivation involves the consequence that the entire increase of

177 lakhs against a total of 407 lakhs in West India  A sizeable proportion is covered  but the areas excluded  Bombay Guirat  Saurashtra and Kutch  are not similar to the areas covered  The area of cultivated land was 212 lakhs of acres in 1891  It dropped heavily to 187 lakhs in 1901   for these areas suffered severely from famine  It recovered to 205 lakhs in I9II and there has been a steady growth since then to 21 7 lakhs in 1921  228 lakhs in 1931  233 lakhs in 1941 and 260 lakhs in 1951  Nevertheless  this growth has fallen far short of the growth of population since 192 I  The area of cultivated land per capita changed as follows  201 cents in 1891  18 7 cents in 1901  188 cents in I9II and 205 cents in 192I  Then  a steady decline to 188 cents in 1931  171 cents in 1941 and 147

Southern  226 62  243  180  \fCHAPTER IV  BEFORE AND SINCE 1921  In 1891  the area of cultivated land was 163 Iakhs of acres  It dropped to 149 lakhs in 1901   this reflects the severity of famine  Then the acreage rose to 175 lakhs in 1911  fell slightly to 171 lakhs in 1921  rose again to 174 lakhs in 1931  declined to 169 lakhs in 1941 and has further declined to 165 lakhs in 1951  which is not much above the 1891 level   This is somewhat exceptional experience  The general rule is for some growth to be kept up  even if it be modest and far short of the rate at which population is growing  It is not altogether clear why an absolute decline should have occurred  seasonal conditions seem unlikely  wholly  to explain it  The result is that the area of cultivated land per capita was more or less stationary during the first thirty year period  196 cents in 1891  191 cents in 1901  198 cents in 19B as well as 1921  and has then steadily declined to lSI cents in 1931  164 cents in 1941 and 1  19 cents in 1951  The two divisions show slightly different features  In North West Madhya Pradesh the area rose from 173 cents in 1891 to 185 cents in 1921 and has since fallen to 143 cents in 1951  The drop is 23 per cent of the 1921 level  In South West Madhya Pradesh  there was a small drop even in the first period from 220 cents in 1891 to 2II cents in 1921 and has since dropped heavily to I56 cents in 195I  The latter drop is 26 per cent of the 192I level   33  Intensification of cultivalion versus extension  The facts reviewed so far leave no room for doubt that there has been such a drop in the area of cultivated land per capita during the thirty years since 1921  that  other things being equal  every man  woman and child must expect to get distinctly less food and other agricultural produce from the land at the end of the period than at the beginning  The magnitude of the drop  as we saw  is about one sixth in only one division of Uttar Pradesh  between one fifth and one fourth in three divisions of Uttar Pradesh  and well in excess of one fourth elsewhere  We shall follow up the implications of a drop in the productivity of cultivation per capita  Here we should clear up  as far as possible  the connection between a drop in the area of cultivated land per capita and a drop in the produc   tivity of cultivation  for the two things are not identical  It is obvious that a drop in the area of cultivated land per capita  from say 72 ccnts to 55 cents  such as has occurred in Central Uttar Pradesh Plain   need not necessarily entail a drop in production of crops of the same order  24 per cent  or even any drop in production at all in certain circumstances  In theory it is possible that more intensive cultivation could have been practised so that the yield per acre increased in 1951 by 24 per cent as compared with the yield per acre in I921  Now  the statistics of yield per acre are much more open to controversy than the  144  \fDECLINE OF CULTIV AnON PER CAPITA  statistics of ac~eage  and having taken all this trouble to arrive at valid conclusions OD the basis of convincing statistics  we should not  in this chapter at any rate  get involved in controversies  Let us consider the differ~nt ways in which an increase in the yield per acre can be brought about  One way is for two or more crops to be raised on the same land in the same year  where only one was raised before  Another is for an irrigated crop to be raised  where the crop was formerly unirrigated  A third method is for more manures and fertilisers to be llsed on the same area of land  A fourth way is to use better seed  use more appropriate methods  and devote greater care and attention to seed heds  seedling and the growing plant  Let us call these f   mr methods more double cropping  more irrigation  better fertilisation and better culture  It s very difficult to measure the last two items  quantitatively  Even if this may be possible in future we have got very little of quantitative data for the past  in respect of manuring of land or the efficiency of husbandry  But we do have data about the first two in terms of double crop acreages and irrigated acreages  In other words  a part of the process of intensification of cultivation  very probably the most important part  is reflected in acreage statistics in just the same way as extension of cultivation  It can therefore be studied in the same way  If we find that the double crop area and irrigated area increased at a faster rate than the growth of populationso that they could have offset the effect of the area of cultivated land lagging behind the growth of population  then all would be well  If we do not find this  then we would have gone a long way near measuring the decline in the productivity of cultivation per capita  as distinguished from the area of cultz  lJ 1 d kzn4 per capz ta   34  Double crop area per capila  The gross area sown less the area of cultivated land  or net area sown  may be referred to a~ the  double crop area    In 1891  this was 99 lakhs of acres in all the districts under study  About 10 per cent of the area of cultivated land at that time was doubJecrop area  By 1921  the double crop area rose to 109 lakhs of acres which was nearly 12 per cent of the area of cultivated land at the time  In other words  the first thirty year period saw double cropping increasing at a slightly faster rate than cultivated hUld  The growth of population had been slower than both  By 1951  the double crop area had increased to I25 lakhs  which is nearly 13 per cent of the area of cuitivattd land  The double crop area ha i grown during the second thirty year period  a shade faster than the area of cultivated land  but nowhere near the rate of growth of population   \fCHAPTER IV  BEFORE AND SINCE I921  When these areas are dividtd by the population figures  we get the doublecrop area per capita as follows  12 cents in 1891  13 cents in 1921  and 10 cents in 1951  The table below shows that the picture is much the same in all four zones  TABLE 10  Double crop area per capita  IN CENTS   North India distric ts South India districts

irrigated area had risen by 241akhs to 152 lakhs of acres  The increase was faster than the increase in the gross area sown for the percentugc was now 14  7 against 12  9 in 1 891  In 1951  the irrigated area had further riscn by another 17 lakhs to 169 lakhs of acres  The increase in the irrigated area was a shade f~lster than the in  Tease in the gross area sown and the percentage now stood at 15   1  When  we divide the irrigated arca by the population and trace the changes in irrigated area per capita  the result is as follows  The arcas under study had 16 cents of irrigated hmd per capita in 1891  This rose to IS cents in 1931  It stands at 14 cents in 1951  The fllllowing table ~ho vs the position in different zones   TABLE 11  Irrigated areG per capita  IN CENTS   r

\fDECLINE OF CULTIVATION PER CAPITA  36  We may now sum up the results of our study of the selected districts in which some 12 crores of the people of India live  The following l Onclusions arc established    J  Just as there is a sharp contrast between the growth of population during two thirty year periods before and after the 1921 Census  there is an equally sharp contrast in the relationship of this growth to the growth of cultivation   JI  This relationship may be expressed in three factors  thc  arca of cultivated land per capita   the  double crop area per capita  and the  irrigated area per capica   The contrast between the two thirty year periods consists in this   Each of these three factors changed hut lillie durillg the first thirty year period  Each was a liule hi

somewhat faster than the area of cultivated land  but very much less fast than the increase of population  The aggregate l f all three factors has als   dropped heavily between 1   21 and 1950  tUld the drop is not very l~lr short of three quarters of the 1921 level  IV With Wlcsscntial variations  these features arc reproduced in every divisiun  The drop is Jess heavy in the North   nearer one

even lower th~m in J 891  But the steady decline of all the factors during three decades since J J21  is an all per7 asive fact  37  In making this study we have had to restrict ourselves to one third of the popUlation mainly because it was necessary to cover two thirty year periods on a continuous and comparable basis  If we restrict ourselves only to the second thirty year period 192T 50  it is

This question is essentially quantitative  It is not sufficient to say that gainful employment in industries and services has increased  It is not even sufficient to say that the rate of growth of industries and services  has not fallen short of the rate of growth of the population  assuming that  this snitement is true   What is required is such a change in the numbers as would enable us to conclude that lhe development of industries and services has proceeded fast enough to offset the decline of cultivat£on per capita during the  last three  decades  It is unfortunately not possible to clinch the answer to this qttestidtl otIe way or the other conclusively by statistics  Our data relating to indnstries and services are by no means comparable with the cultivation statistics set  out in the last section  They do not also go back far enough on a compartible basis   44  At first sight it would seem that the census  data should suffice to separate the growth of population in villages from the growth of population in  towns and this might go a long way to answer the question  The relevant Hlfdrmation is given in the table below   TABLE 15  GrOfl lh  IN LAKHS   Pvpulmic11l  IN l

rate of growth in villages 1S loWer than In towns  the difference being accounted for by migration from villages to towns  Among the towns themselves it seems  in general  likely that the cities  and major towns tend to grow more rapidly and the rate of growth shows clear  signs of acceleration  Thus  the ten largest cities added over half a crore to their population during the decade immediately before the 1951 Census  The addition during the preceding decade  1931 40  had been less than one third of a crore  Even this was nearly twice as large as the addition which had laken place during a period of 30 years preceding the 1931 Census  The figures for these cities  on a town group basis  are given below   TABLE  r6    I N LAKHS   Town group  Additions to  popu at cm dutillg Population

general impression  one forms by observation of city life of a greatly increased vdlume of non agricultural avocations  They ate  however  misleading if accepted as an indication of the  change in the life of the people as a whole  For it will be noticed that the  growth ofrural population during the last three decades though smaller than that of towns is  nevertheless quite large  There is little doubt that the rate of growth of rnral population  has substantially out stripped the rate of progress of cultivation  Has there been a  growth of rural  industries and services on a scale sufficient

BEFORE AND SINCE 1921  unlikely  though we cannot support a definitive answer conclusively by statistics   46  Even though a conclusive answer may not be furnished it is necessary that available data should be examined with full comprehension of the difficulty in drawing inferences from them and such indications as they provide should be noted  The economic data yielded by the Censuses of 193I and 1951 have been analysed in order to set up such comparisons as appear reasonably possible and valid  There are difficulties arising out of small but significant changes in definitions and classifications  There are also other difficulties necessarily inherent in any such enquiries carried out on a mass scale over a sub continent  A full account of these matters will be found in the paper 1j printed as ApPENDIX III  The conclusions recorded at the end of this paper are reproduced below  I During the twenty years following 193 I  population grew faster than cultivation  The area of cultivated land per capira is known to have declined significantly in Unar Pradesh  Bihar  Orissa  Assam  Madras  Iviysore  Travancore Cochin  Bombay  Madhya Pradesh and Punjab  There is little doubt  that if correct figures of cultivation had been available for other states a similar decline would have been observed in all of them  II Notwithstanding such decline in the area of cultivated land per  capita  the relative weight of dependence on agriculture for gainful employment has not declined in the country as a whole  It is probable that it has increased slightly  Such increase is observable in Uttar Pradesh  Bihar  Orissa  Assam  Madras  Hyderabad  Rajasthan and Punjab  Dependence on agriculture has not changed in Madhya Pradesh  It has probably diminished in Bombay  West Bengal and Mysore  III The main reaction to this general decline in the area of cultivated land per capita  unaccompanied by a more than proportionate increase in non agricultural employment  has been a general lncrease of non earning dependency  The increase in absolute numbers of non earning dependants has exceeded the entire increase of rural population in India  as well as in each of five zones out of six  The percentage of non earning dependants to the general population has increased in every major state except Bombay  West Bengal and Punjab  It has decreased slightly in Bombay and West Bengal  and is practically unchanged in Punjab   IS4  \fCitANGES IN THE LIVEUHOOt  PATT£RN  The increases in the percentages arc not accompanied by any material change in sex ratio or age structure  They must  therefore  be regarded as a rough index of the growth of unemployment in different parts of the country   IV  There has been a general increase throughout the country in the number of cultivators and cultivating labourers  inc1uding unpaid family helpers  working on the same area of cultivated land  say 100 acres  The increases are relatively small in the following states  Assam  46 to 48   Bihar  50 to 52   Uttar Pradesh  49 to 51   Madras  34 10 36  and Orissa  29 to 32   Larger increases are observed in the following states   Punjab  23 to 26   Bombay  17 to 23   Madhya Pradesh  26 to 33  and Travancore Cochin  4 1 to 57   Among the major states for which figures are available  Mysore alone shows a fall in this number  32 to 26   The figures of increase in the number of workers provide rough indication that under emp~oyment is growing on the land  but the picture is somewhat blurred by uncertainty about the role of unpaid family helpers in the cultivation of land   V   Material changes have occurred in the percentage of cultivating labourers to all workers in land  i  e   cultivating labourers and cultivators including their unpaid family helpers   There is only one major state where this percentage has increased  TravancorcCochin  34 to 47   Th~ percentage has remained practically unchanged in Bihar  27 26   Mysore  13 14   Hyderabad  31  and Punjab  11 12    In other states the percentage has fallen  Uttar Pradesh  18 to 9   Orissa  30 to 19   West Bengal  40 to 28  Madras  3 8 to 35   Bombay  43 to 18   Madhya Pradesh  43 to 32  and Rajasthan  II to 4   The fall in the percentage of cultivating labourers is the natural result of increase in the number of cultivators and members of their families occupying the same area of cultivated land  The cultivators  need for employing labourers diminishes  as also their capacity to pay for their services     It is clear  however  that this is not the sole cause of the fall in the proportion of cultivating labourers  There are reasons to  ISS  \fCHAPtER rv  BEFORE AND SINCE ~t  ~eve t hat in v~  l orts  « trIte  ooUlIlry  tbere were consider    able  number  of  people wl o were in fact

cultivators and cultivating labourers and whose Classification was open to geittline 30ubt  As  a result of the operation of tenancy legislation   old and  new  as  Wen  as the general change in the social climate  it is likely that a  convetsiort  has taken place between 1931 and 195 1 of many such people  from the status of cultivating labourers to cultivators  Such  conversion  probably accounts for an important part of the fall in the proportion of cultivating labottrers observed ifi Bombay  Madhya Pradesh  Uttar Pradesh  RajasdiatJ  and possibly also  elsewhere  While there is

regarded as a likely occurrence before 194I  This d cvelo pment is generally referred to as  food controls   That is a poor and somewhat misleading description of the reality  which consists primarily of a gigantic state trading system  set up by the Central Government and all the State Governments functioning in co operation with   Inc another  What arc called  controls  are the legal restrictions on traders  producers and cons umers of food~ns which enable this state trading system to function   The operations of this system   luring the three calendar years 1949  1950 and 1951 may be summed up in a few simple figures  On an average  43  0 lakhs of tons were purchased every year in different states within the country     mostly from farmers directly  in some places from traders  Another 34  8 lakhs of tons were purchased every year from various foreign countries of the world  These enormous quantities of food were moved over great distances  stored and distributed  The purchases  md distributions were carried out in accordance with an overall basic plan framed once every year for the country as a who 4  by the Centnd Government  and  within the fralllcwor~ of this plan  of detailed plans for each state  framed by the St  te Government conccrn  d  These plans were not designed to make commercial profits  They were dcsi~ed primarily to meet the daily needs of crores of people all the year round  to safegw trd severa  other cfores of people against the serious consequences of e~~essive rise of prices or interruptions of supply in private trade  So long as aggregate slJPplics arc smaller thAn the quantities needed  the plans were design eq to spref d the national shortage over as large a number as possible and insure them against the risk of death by starvation

and 66 lakhs  Not a J of them were supplied coatinUQusly all the year rOWld  At least one third of th is tot~l must have been so supplied  possibly more  The others were supplied with grain during those months of the year when they were most in need and when private trade could be least relied upon to provide regular supplies at fair prices  TABLE 17 on next page shows the number of consumers

Government never wanted to carry the rc ponsibility  They have made more than one effort to rid themselves of it  but wiihout success  Why did this happen  We should try to understand the development in the perspective of hi tory  48  The establishment and development of a free market throughout India and its linkage with the world market was perhaps the mo~t important among the economic changes brought about under British rule sometime in the middle of the last century  The reform was visibly beneficial  in that it gave a great fillip to the development of cultivation  A brisk foreign trade grew up  Notwithstanding this general prosperity  parts of the country were ravaged by famine and some classes of the people  especially those who were losing their livelihood in the new frec market  suffered grievously  Therefore tht  Government of those days took effective steps energetically in order to combat the famine5  to relieve suffering and to save life  What was the right thing to do in order to achieve these purposes  without creating avoidabJc wastes and abuses  was not easy to settle off hand  it had to be discovered by tnal and enor  One of the most contentiom and perplexing issues in this process of trial and error had been whether or not steps should be taken by Government to contro  the price of grain and arrange its distribution  The conclusion finally reached was recorded by the Famine Commission of 1880 in the following terms    We have no doubt that the true principle for the Government to adopt as its general rule of conduct in this matter is to leave the business of the supply and distribution of food to private trade  taking care that every possible facility is given for its free action  and that all obstacles matel ial or fiscal are  as far as practicable  removed  The manner in which the demand for grain in South India in 1877 was met by supplies sent from the North showed the promptitude witn which IndilUl trade will oper~te  l58  \f  ROWTH OF FOOD SHORTAGE  when the facilities for transport and the profit expected are adequate            It is only reasonable to anticipate that with every year s additional experience of the use to be made of the railways and the tdegraphs  the activity and sensitiveness ofIndian trade will continue to grow  and that with the new stimulus thus imparted to it  and the gradual extension of rail ways into districts where they do not yet exist  the power of meeting the wants of the population  in time of local scarcity  will be still further developed  Every interference by the Government with the operations of trade must be auverse to this tendency  and prejudicial to those habits of sdf rcliance Which it is so esscnti al for Government to encourage    This policy was consistently followed  In the short run  it was not conspicuously successful  Thus it failed during the last decade of the last century when millions died of famine  while export of grain was going on  The failure must be attributed to the fact that the basic assumption underlying the poJicythe presence of an overall surplus even in the worst famine years  was not yet a act  But it was tending to became a fact  With every year that passed thereafter  the policy turned out to be so uniformly successful that it got established as an axiom of public administration  for a brief space of a few months  shortly aftcr the end of World War I  the axiom was called in question  prices and mov~ments of rice had to be controlled  But the spasm passed  Every thing was normal again  A generation grew up which took it for granted that interference by G·ovcrnmcnt in any shape or form  with the activities of tradeps was unthinkable  The vitality of this belief wus such that it survived the world economic depression of the thirties  A fantastic filII of grain prices was occurring  All over the country  crorcs of farmers were reeling Wlder the blow  sujfering unjust losses and getting loaded with debts  Bankruptcies were multiplying  It was realised that the country and the world were passing through an extraordinary crisis  It was necessary to do something especially to relieve the fllrll1Crs  So  arrangements were made to suspend or remit land revenue and rents  Governments went even so far as to scale down debtsat first by conciliation and later by statutory compulsion  But that anything sh  uld be done directly to adjust the market supply of grain to the market demand and fix and hold a fair price  the idea was not even seriously considered  49  The change came about all of a sudden  shortly after Japan entered World War II and her forces occupied most of the countries of South East Asia  Emma fell  and the imports of rice from that country were cut off  The reaction in all the grain markets of India was immediate  violent and prolonged  Supplies disappeared and reappeared in smaIl quantities fitfully  Prices shot up inexplicably  This could not go on for any length of time without putting the lives of masses of people in jeopardy  Bankruptcy is one thingdeath is another  The Governments had  perforce  to interfere  But they 159  \fCHAPTER IV  BEFORE AND SINCE 192   found  OOn enough  that a simple order addressed to the trade to the effect that a pric   specified in tl te ord cr should not be exceeded  meant nothing  at all  It merely meant that law abiding traders should quit business  leaving the tracle eudrely in the hands of hardened speculators  The consumer was worse off than before  Experience clearly showed that it was not a question of wickedness of individuals  it was the system which could no longer function  The vast mass of traders  the retailers  were ready and willing to carry out distribution according to the needs of the people within the limits of prices fixed by Governments  but only if they could be assured by Government that they could get regular supplies at corresponding prices  This meant Government going into the wholesale trade in a big way  superseding a relatively small nwnber of the larger wholesale dealers  to whom speculation offered too great a temptatioR to resist   converting the smaller wholesale dealers into its own agents  and  most important of alJ  assuring itself   f fcgul2r supplies from farmers by the exercise of statutory powers  No one had planned in advance that these were the right steps to take  It took time to find out  by a process of trial and error  But it did not take very long in those part5 of tbe country where the Provincial or State Government had a clear perception of the objective to be secured and a firm determination to secure it  There was some delay and indecision in Bengal  and this coincided with a crop failure  not  in itself  of a very exceptional character   The result was a tragic repetition of the famines of the last century  IS lakhs of people died of hWlger and the diseases attending famine  all within a few months  The tragedy gave a sharp jolt to the minds of the people and made them realise that Wlles~ there wa~ enough t   ~dgrains to spare after meeting the needs of evcrybudy  free trade caIUlot fWlction  It was necessary that controlled behaviour should be imposed by Government on all concerned  It was especially necessary that thos~ producers to whom food was not a problem  should part with their surplus of grain in due time at a fixed price  So long as the people J   alised this and co operated with the efforts of Government  the system workeq well  and  though crop failures occurred in South India in 1946  which were much more serious than that which touched off tragedy in I943 ~ the distribution of supplies was kept going and 00 lives were lost   50  After the war ended  people waited patiently enough for a couple of years hoping that all these necessary though irksome inn ovations would dis~pcar and they would once again be free to buy and sell foodgrains as they pleaseci and when t ley pleased  This nqstalgia for the retum of free trade was a fa  t  It pervaqed all parts of the cOlUltry and all Governments had to rtckon with it   160  \fGROWTH OF FOOD SHORTAGE  Mingled with this genuine feeling  there was no doubt also the knowledge  8DlQng quite considerable number of people that if the restrictions were removed they could make large profits in a short time  One of the unfortunate developments  during and since World War II  has been an acquired taste for getting rich quickly   A committee appointed by Government went into this question and recommended  by a majority  that the controls should be lifted  A minority warned against the step and argued that the time was not yet ripe  The Government acted on the advice of the majority  Within a few months  the experience of 1942 was repeated  and the minority was proved right  Government quidcly retraced their steps  lest the situation might drift towards a repetition of the experience of I943   51  It is now very ne arly five  years since foodgrain controls were lifted and then re imposed  Every one has been hoping each year that the next year would see the end of these controls  but this has not yet happened  People have also been hoping that the need for importing foodgrains would also disappear and that this would release resources for importing machinery needed for industrialising the country  But this has also failed to happen  On the other hand  Government fmmd themselves compelled to import unprecedentedly large quantities of food grains instead  The relatively easier conditions treated by these imports  coinciding with good season for crops is once again having their effect  The mind of the people has been drifting towards de control and stoppage of imports  in very much the same way as in the closing months of 1947  But the Planning Commission has given warning that controls will have to be kept on and imports will have to be secured  and though the Commission hopes that the implementation of the Plan wlll lead to an end of both in a shon time  it is not prepared to bind itself to a date and it advises caution and preparedness to continue with controls and imports as long as nece~sary   52  There is  today  a widespread sense of perplexity  a feeling that the present situation is unintelligible  and  in consequence  a big question mark over the future  There are many questions to which firm answers appear to be unavailable  How much food do we need   How much more food do we need as the population is added to each year  How much food are we producing  No doubt this changes from one year to another because of the seasons  but what  on an average of good  bad and indifferent seasons  are we in fact producing  Is this really less than what we need   If so  bow much less   Is it really impossible to do with that much less    Must we import  If so  how much  At what rate has this avmge production of food been increasing 161  \fCHAPTER IV  BEFORE AND SINCE 1921  in the past  At what rate can we expect it normally to increase in the future    To what extent can the various development schemes which are included in the First Five Year plan rdise the level of average production  Can we or can we not manage without imports  If we can  when   Until then  how much should we import  Can we afford to pay for these imports  All these are relevant questions  Most people  probably all whose interest in public affairs is sufficient to induce them to read newspapers regularly  have no doubt put these questions to themselves  Jt is doubtful whether anyone is quite sure in his mind that he has got the right answer to even half the number of questions  The fact is  and we must face it  there are no demonstrably certain answers to these questions  It is true that all the questions raise matters of apparently sjmple fact  which can be cleared up if statistics are available  But the statistical system of the country has not been designed to answer these questions with certwnty  It has not been so designed  because these qucstiCllS did not require to be answered until about the time when Japan entered World  War II  And yet there is great need for answers which  even if not certain  would carry conviction as probably correct  Experience shows that the peopk are not unready to 8ccept reasonable restraints designed for the ccm mcn geed or to maKe present sacrifices in order to secure the welfare of the next generation  But they will not do this if they lack conviction of necessity  This conviction is seldom acquired by ratiocination  It is gained by the mass of the people largely by guidance from the leaders of public opinion  And the leaders cannot succeed in imparting conviction unless they possess it themselves  I t is the purpose of this section and the rest of this report to make such a contribution to the c1arifiUlticn of these important questions as a careful study of available data may render possible  53  We can be fairly definite about the time when undivided India· changed over from being a net exporter of foodgrains into a net importer of foodgrains  As it happens  this too was round about 1921  We shall proceed to review the evidence on this point  before and since I921  There is a remarkable passage in the report of the Famine Comm~ssion of 1880 which refers to certain figures as indicating that  the ordinary outturn of food in British India exceeds 50 million tons  and the ordinary surplus available for storage  for export  or for th€ luxurious consumption of the richer classes is more than 5 million tons   The Commission proceeds then to discuss the           The old statistics of India related to India within present limits  plus Pakistan plus Bunna  Separation of the figures relating to tht se areas presents a difficult problem  Burma figures have been separated  Thereference to  undivided India  means India plus Pakistan   16~  \fGROWTH OIl  FOOD SHORTAGt  probable shortage likely to be caused in the production of the larg~t area which   on the basis of previous experience  might be expected to be affected by famine  and whether  or not there would be sufficient stocks available within the country to meet the shortage thus caused  The probable shortage of the area affected by the worst famine  deemed to be likely  was assumed as 3 million tons  Three sources of supply were designated as available to meet the shortage   First  the local stocks of the distressed area which taken at three months  supply of the people s food amounts to 2 3   4 millions  second  thelyear s surplus of the districts not affected which would be 3 I  a millions but might be expected to be larger in consequence of the diminished consumption  and third  the local stocks in these districts    The Commission found no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that  these three sources of supply  taken together  would appear to be quite sufficient to provide what was required   Two members of the Commission dissented from this conclusion  They said  We are unable to place confidence on the table which shows an estimated annual surplus yield of five million tons of foodgrains  The average annual  export of rice and grain from all India is one million tons  which should thus leave four million tons to be laid by  a quantity sufficient to feed 24 millions of poople  As famines come but once in 12 years  there should in that period be an accumulated surplus sufficient to feed nearly 300 millions  And yet when famine does come  and then affecting at its worst not more than a tenth of that number  it is only by immense pressure on other parts of India  and at a quadrupled price  that the barest sufficiency of supplies can be obtained  This seems a clear proof that the alleged surplus must be gready overestimated    This echo from the past is not very unlike a good deal of statistical controversy to which the public has become accustomed during the last ten years  The point to be noted in these exchanges is not as to who was right  the minority  as usual  seems to have been right   but what emerges as undisputed common ground  Both sides agree that India was then normally surplus in foodgrains  The dispute was about whether or not  in the worst famine year  the stocks available would physically exceed the requirements of consumption  At any rate  we know that India was then normally surplus in foodgrains  54  Elsewhere in the report we have details about the size of this surplus The Commission explains how and why the value of India s exports was substantially in excess of imports   For the last ten years  the excess of exports has averaged about 16 million sterling ofwruch perhaps halfmay be regarded as the return on capital invested in railways and commercial enterprises and h lf as the charge on account of the administration of India by England which has to be met in  England    \fCHAP tER IV  BEFORE AND SINCE 1921  The principal exports are almost entirely the raw produce of agriculture and animal husbandry  They include foodgrains valued at 9 million sterling  or almost exactly the return on capital invested in railways and commercial enterprises   The quantity  touched its highest point in 1876 7  when it reached 26 210 000 cwt   and had fallen to 22 887 000 cwt   in 1878 9   The figures indicate an average of about 12 lakhs of tons per annum as the level of foodgrain exports at the time  The two chief items were rice and wheat and the destinations were Europe  Mauritius  the Cape  other colonies  Arabia and Persia  Thus  we start with the firm knowledge that in or about 1880   India was normally surplus in joodgrai ns  i ncluding both rice and wheat  and the surplus was of the order of 12 lakhs of tons per annum   55  Then we have good evidence of what was happening during the last decade of the nineteenth century and the first decade of the present century  The relevant statistics were assemb1ed and sifted and the figures relating to Burma separated by a Special Officer  Shri K  L  DATTA  appointed by the Government of India in 1910  The figures for undivided India  averaged for five year periods  are as follows   TABLE 18   IN LAKHS OF TONS   Five·year

famine decade shows the level of net exports to be much the same or as a little above the level reached some 15 ye~ earlier  and described by the Famine Commission of 1880  The second half shows a sharp drop doubtless reflecting the crop failures which led to famine   But it is significant that exports were taking place even then  though millions were dying in many parts of the country for want of food  We noted this already in our review of policy in relation to freedom of trade   Then there is a recovery during the first five years of this century followed by a drop  The decade as a whole shows a small decline of about 3 lakbs in ten years  which may not be specially 164  \fcttownt OF FOOD SHottTAGit  significant  But the trend shown in the table below was undOUbtedly quite significant

was established in Burma later than in India  Suppression of civil disorder  settlement of title to land on durable and secure tenures  development of transportation  creation of a free market and its Hnkage with a free world market  these were the measures which had already started the development of agricultural production and the canalisation of the resultant surplus into the growing world market  What had already occurred in undivided India was now occurring in Burma after a time lag of a few decades  In undivided India  the effects of development were beginning to wear off  and one may  in retrospect  already note signs of the steep diminution of exports of foodgrains which was to follow  In Burma  on the other hand  there was still very considerable scope for profitable development of agricultural production  net exports of foodgrains were  therefore  still rising  The policy of non interference with private trade in grain  even if famine raged in parts of the country   the doctrine of the Famine Commission of 1880  worked successfully for nearly forty years  because India  Pakistan and Burma formed a single trading unit and this combined unit had a large and growing exportable surplus of grain  A physical shortage of supply over the entire rerrirory of India  Pakistan and Burma was out of the question  and the development of modem transportation by fail and steamship assured the availability of commercial supplies in all parls of this   territory at all times as required    6  From about the period of World War I  separate statistics for India have been worked out by the Directorate of Economics and  Statistics of the  165  \fCHAPTER IV  BEFORE AND SINCE  t~~ ~  Ministry of Food and Agriculture  They tell us what· happened during a ~ uccession of five five year periods ending with the outbreak of World War II  During the first of these periods i e   1915 16 to 1919 20  undivided India was ~ till functioning as a net exporter  Exports were 15 • 9 lakhs tons and imports  were II 9 Jakhs of tons  Net exports were 4 0 lakhs of tons which is smaller than the last figure we saw for the period 1905 06 to 1909 10  It is signi1icant that in spite of all the inducements and pressures which must have stimulated exports during war time  the figure was smaller than 10 years earlier  This helps us to understand why it turned out to be the last five year period when undivided India was a net exporter of foodgrains  Thereafter  there was a net mport dur ng every five year period as shown by the table below  TABLE 20  IN LAKHS OF TONS   Five year period 1920 21 to 1924 25 1925 26 to 1929 30 1930  3 1 to 1934 35 I935 36 to 1939  40  Imports  Exports  Net Imports  11 4  9 8  1 6  15 9  8 3  7 6  18 4 20 7  S 7  12 7

decrease in the expon of foodgrains  mainly wheat   Net exports had ended  Net imports were increasing rap dly in undivided India  At the same time  however  the development of Burmese agriculture was still proceeding  The average level of net exports out of Burma had risen from 23·2 lakhs of tons per annum during 1905 06 to 1909  10 to 30  6 lakhs of tons per annum during the quinquennium preceding World War II    57  The subsequent changes during and since World War II may be briefly told  During 1940 41 and 1941 42 net imports diminished to 9 6 lakhs and 4  3 lakhs  During 1942 43 imports were cut off and India supplied Ceylon and a few other places  net exports reappeared for about one year though the quantity was small  only 2  9 lakhs  The Bengal Famine occurred during 1943

tons  The shortage was made good mainly by eating into the carry over  the stocks normally carried hy farmers  traders and consumers were reduced  thus adding greatly to the difficulties of distribution  and creating the risks of break down which was the nightmare of 1946  The first full post war year  1946 47  saw India importing 25  8 lakhs and the next year  1947 48  26 ·61akhs  At that stage  the agitation against state trading commenced  These imports seemed to be both enormous and unnecessary  hence the demand for stoppage of imports and lifting of controls  This did not  however  work  During 1948 49  the first full year after partition  India imported 30  5 lakhs  Then it was reduced to 28  6 and 27  2 lakhs  This was followed by two successive years of very large imports  The Report of the Planning Commission mentions 32 71akhs as the average level of imports during 1947 52   58  32 7 lakhs of tons may seem  at first sight  to be a large figure for imp 0 r tat ion every year  But it would not surprise anyone who was familiar with the trend of changes in popUlation and cultivation as well as of imports and exports of foodgrains and who had appreciated the significance of the figures in TABLE 20  Indeed  as we shall see later  the real occasion for surprise and perplexity is that the level of average imports rose so slowly and is still so low  when compared with the rapidity of decline of cultivation per capita  One other comment which should be made at this stage is the fact that the composition of the imports had changed greatly  there was very little rice and a great deal of wheat and coarse grains  Before World War II  it will be recalled  India was importing rice heavily  but still exporting wheat  The change of composition became necessary because the grain was procured mostly from new sources of supply  It is necessary to note what happened to Burma whose steadily increasing exports of rice were the main source of supply of steadily increasing imports into India  During the war  of course  Burma exported no rice to India  After the war ended  a trickle of exports re started  On an average of three years 1948 so it has risen only to 12  I lakhs  which was lower than the level reached over sb ty years ago   and less than two fifths of the level reached just before World War II  As it is obvious that the population of Burma could not have grown during these 10 or 12 years to the point at which its export surplus could be so largely eaten up  it is evident that cultivation must have diminished  or the marketing of the surplus  is being held up or both must have happened  The disturbed conditions which have  no doubt  contributed to these results may be overcome at a not too distant date  But would 167  \fcrum~  IV  BEFORE AND SINCE 1921  exports from Burma ever again reach the pre war level   Or may it be that it would reach only a lower level and then Burma would repeat the history of India with a declining level of exports   59  Did the rapid growth of net imports after 1921 owe its origin to the decline of cultivation per capita  or could it be that it was due to a shift of cultivation away from foodgrains to other crops  There was indeed a decline in the percentage of area sown to foodgrains to the total sown area under all crops  The figures for the districts whose statistics were specially compiled and set outinthelastsectionwere8o 7percentinr891  71 8percent in 1921 and 77 2 per cent in 195I  The difference between 1921 and 1951 is hardly significant   The main increases in imports  which took place during the last three decades  cannot therefore be attributed to the shift in cultivation away from joodgrains  This is an important fact  Whi~e this is true of India as a whole  the shift is somewhat more clearly marked in particular areas  This is seen from the table below  TABLE 21  Percentage of area under foodcrops to total area sown N atuTal division Bombay Deccan Northern

and cotton  were more significant before 1921 than later   ii  they were more significant in South India and West India than elsewhere  and  iii  that shifts in the opposite direction also occurred  these being signifkant in North Indi~ and Central India  168  \fGRoWTii OF FOOb sito1d Ael 60  The period of several years during which India was forced to manage  without adequate imports of grains witnessed an increase of grain prices of an altogether Wlprecedented character  When it took place  there WhS no question of its being dictated by economic necessity  There was a shonage of foodgrains  and people must eat or starve to death  Under conditions of free trade  those who held grain could  by the simple plOcess of declining to sell it for a time  raise the price to almost any height  An d they did so  repeatedly  The first wave of increase took place in this manner until the Governments scepped in  and by lheir intervention froze the prices at whatever levels had been reached in different pans of the country on various dates in the second half year of 1942 and the first half year of 1943  In Bengal  the freezing came later  As a result noc of price control orders but of the operation of the state trading system  the price of foodgrains was held for sometime at a stable level  But the consequences of the original rise were working themselves our  The pIices of other foodstuffs and agricultural produce went up because the price of grain had gone up  The cost of food having gone up  wages had to be raised or supplemented by dearness al1owances  The price of other commodities went up because wages and dearness allowances increased the cost of production  When the wheel had thus come full circle  the farmers complained that other prices had risen against them while the price of grain was held down by Government control  They also complained about the arbitrary differences between grain prices allowed to farmers in different parts of the country which had only a historical  and no economic  justification  Compkints of this nature helped to ~well the general chorus of discontent which led to de control early in 1948  A second wave of rise in prices followed   Re control froze the grain prices at the higher levels reached by the second  wave  The repercussioxu  of these higher prices of grains were reinforced by the effects of the Korean War  The struggle of the Governments against the persistent tendency of prices to rise still continues  The tap root of this continued pressure still remains  the fundamental disparity between the demand for and supply of foodgrains  and the fact that the consumer cannot stand out against a rise in grain prices in the same way in which he can stand out against a rise in prices of almost any other commodity or service  History provides no more vivid demonstration of the crucial role of grain prices in the life of the people  61  It so happens that the longest continuous record of carefully ascertained prices is available with the Madras Government  From this record a chan has been prepared which shows the trend of South Indian paddy prices over a periOd  169  \fciiAPtER IV  BEFORE ANi  SINcE 192i of ISO years  The chart will repay careful study  For the first  fifty years one can see a level course   the price bobs up and down  but the fluctuations are relatively small  Then for another fifty years one can see that the line  above and below which fluctuations take place  is n0 longer level  Each decade is  a little higher than the preceding one  At the same time  the fluctuations tend to be sharper  We get peaks arising suddenly  they are the famine years  This part of the diagram shows the trend of India s free market  firmly linked to a growing world market  And then the last fifty years with the first big peak marking out World War I  then a valley marking the world economic depression and  finally  the tallest of all peaks on which we stand today  62  On the top left  hand comer  in the same cNtrt  there is an inset diagram which is also well worth study  It shows the comparison between the course of wheat prices in the United States of America  marked by a black line  and South Indian paddy prices  marked by a red line   both being reduced to a common index with the years 1925  26 to 1929 30 as the base period  It is a convenient base  for  it marks the level from which grain prices plunged downwards and caused great hardship among farmers  Until a few years before World War I  wheat prices in the United States had been moving downwards  over a long  period  During the same period  the South Indian paddy price was moving upwards  The American peak during World War I was very much taner than the Indian peak  Then the two prices moved in step  and followed a remarkably similar course   sometimes one leading and sometimes the other  throughout the period between the two world wars  and since the end of World War II up to 1948  Whereas  however  the American price has stayed behind at a level which is just under 200 per cent of the base period level  ours has moved up to 292 per cent · 63  In our attempt to establish the real existence  to assess the size  and to determine the rate of growth of our shortage of foodgrains  we have relied so far only on figures of imports and exports  We have brought in the figUres about foodgrain prices  as corroborative evidence of a telling nature  and to indicate how the entire economy in all its parts is detrimentally affected by the present condition of supplies and prices of foodgrains  We now proceed to a much  It should perhaps be made clear here that the chart shows the South Indian paddy priccs  not because they art peculiar   but because they are the only prices

in foodgrains shows that over this period long tenn trend must have been the same in respect ofthe grain prices generally in all parts of India  Statistical data showing the course of prices after

production and consumption  Why is  this undertaking hazardous  About seventy years ago  as we saw  the Famine Commission atteInpted this task and reached the conclusion that there was a surplus  6fabout 42 lakhs of tons per annum in the territory now divided into India and PaJdstan  and there was in addition a surplus of about 8 lakhs in Bunna  Two members of the Commission rejected the figures as well as the conclusion and gave quite convincing reasons for doing so  Seven decades have passed since then  OUf state of knowledge is not much bener today  A little less than ten years ago  the Commission which enquired into the Bengal Famine attempted a similar task  limited however to the territory and population of undivided Bengal  A relevant extract from the analysis made by the Commission  part of which is useful for our enquiry  will be found in ApPENDIX V  The conclusion  reached by the Commission  which indicates the hazard clearly  runs as follows   It may thus be concluded tnat the information available is such that an estimate of the annual consumption of the province bused on population statistics and an assumed average rate of individual consumption is likely to err by as much as 2 million tons  Or about 25 per cent of the estimate  So wide a margin of error blocks this method of approach    A few weeks ago  the Department of Economic Affairs of the Government of India issued a report on the results of the   First Round  enquiry of the National Sample Survey  An attempt had been made to ascertain buth production and consumption in rural areas by enquiries made from heads of househe Ids selected on a random sample basis  The enquiry yielded the following resu~  s   The average rural household produced 19· fJ maw ds of foodgrains every year and ate 26  4 maunds during eVe1   year  As this obviously cannot be correct  the report proceeds to distinguish between its consumption estimate and its production estimate and found reasons for rejecting the latter and acceptin~ the former as reliable  But then there was a difficulty  If its consumption estimate was substantially correct then the figures compiled by all the State Governments and the Central Government and annually published as the estimated yieJd of crops could not also be correct  The report preferred the consumption estimate ascertained by the  First ROWld   enqary rnd recorded the opinion   on the basis of the above conclusions  the magnitude of under estimation of the official figures of production would seem to lie between 20 and 27 per cent  of the estimated consumption out of domestic production   This particular conclusion mayor may not be correct  Even if it is correct it does  not prove  as some commentators thought it dId  that India s production of foodgrains exceeded  its requirements and there was no shortage offoodgrains  What the report does really 111  \fCHAPTER IV  BEFORE ANb SiNCE t92t prove in relation to India as a whole is what the Famine Enquiry Commission had already stated about undivided Bengal  Our knowledge of the absolute magnitude of either production or consumption i8 subject to a flJide  margin  oj uncertainty  so wide that it is larger than the magntiude of our shortage  64  That this is the present state of our knowledge is a fact  and we have  to face it as a fact  But it does not fo11ow  in consequence  that we shall be wise to bold any opinion we please about food shortage  It does not absolve us from the obligation to form as sound a judgment as possible on all the evidence available io us  A detailed study of this evidence will be found in a note entitled   Production  cons1 U11ption and shortage of foodgrains  1951     printed as one of the papers of ApPENDIX V  below   The main  conclusions may be set out as      The average yje1d  less seed  on one acre sown to all foodgrains is 6  0 maunds in the country as a whole  The rate is higt e~t in South India  8 2 maunds  and lowest in West India  3 6 maunds   The rates in other zones  in Older  are  East India  1  3   North India  6 6   North West India  6 2  and Central India  4  5   11  The average rate of consumption of foodgrains per head of population per annum is 4·5 maunds  The rate is highest in North· West India  5  0 maunds  and lowest in South India  3  8 maunds   The rates in other zones  in order  are  Central India  4 8   North India  4 6   East India  4 6  and West India  4 0    No separate allowance is made for grain fed to cattle and grain wasted between the field and the kitchen  The rates include such grain also    III  India s shortage of foodgrains  round about 1951  was 34 lakhs of tons  being the difference between 590 lakhs of tons of consumption and 556 lakhs of harvested yield  less seed   The shortage is equivalent to the foodgrains needed for consumption during 21 days in the year  Among the zones  the shortage is negligible in Central India and relatively small in North India and North West India  The shortages in the other three zones expressed in the number of days of consumption requirements are as follows  West India  67 days   South India  34 days  and East India  17 days   It should be clearly borne in mind that these are only the best estimates which can be framed on the basis of official figw cs of acreage and yield of crops  They may be wrong  The total production may be higher  If so  the total consumption must also be higher correspondingly  172  \fCROWTB OF FOOD SHORTAGE  6S  A great many people are puzzled by the fact that the shortage is adminedly a small proportion of total consumption  the food needed for only  n days in the  year  Why should there be so much difficulty about managing without imports and without controls  This question has been posed and conclusively answered in a number of reports  a few relevant extractS will be found in ApPENDIX V  It is necessary that the answer should be understood and conviction attained that  free trade cannot junction in a market which is genuinely short of foodgrainshowefJef  small the shortage  •   66  Another question arises in relation to the relative smallness of the shortage of foodgrains  We have seen that about thirty years ago  undivided India was neither a net exporter nor a not importer of foodgrains  At that time production per capita and consumption per capita were in balance  Since then  there has been a decline of cultivation per capita of not less than  say  one fifth  If our rate of consumption per capita had been 4  5 maunds then  as it is assessed to be now  then the shortage today must be of the order of o· 9 maunds  nine  tenths of a maund to a maund per capita  But this is assessed at about 34 lakhs of tons per  annum in absolute quantity or rather less than o· 3 of a maund per capita  The difference is Jarge and it raises an important issue  We can understand why imports have been steadily growing  Once we admit cultivation per capita has been declining for 30 years and the percentage of foodgrain cultivation remained substantially the same  the need for imports on an increasing scale is clear and calls for no further explanation  What needs explanation is  why the imports were not so much larger than they actually were  If the figures so far mentioned are correct  the correct level of imports should be about 100 lakhs of tons  Why are they only 34 lakhs of tons  We must face this questionnot as a matter of arithmetical curiosity  because of its implications for the future  What are the possible explanations    First   Our assessment of the decline of cultivation per capita was based on areas for  which we had statistics  Could it be that in the areas for which there were no statistics  cultivation kept pace with population and there was no decline  or a smaller rate of decline  This is not impossible  for these are generally backward areas  where modern transportation and commercialised agriculture might have been late in arriving  But the net effect on the average rate of decline for India could not have been very large   Secondiy   We took note only of double cropping and irrigation as the factors which might have raised the yield per acre of cW tivated land  What about 173  \fCHAPTJ£R  IV  BEFORE AND SINCE I921  o$er faCtors  Could it be that the scale of manuring has increased  For a number of reasons this seems very unlikely  the contrary is mOTe probable    Could it be that cultivators put in more effort and got a better yield  The   efficial estimates  of yield over a long period do not show any such thing  l JUt that is not very conclusive  because they are not refined methods of measurement and might have easily failed to detect a very small but pervasive increase  if it had occurred gradually over a IOIig period  This possibility is  not to be dismissed lightly   because when people have to emact a subsistence out of the same land for larger numbers  they do have a strong incentive to look after cultivation better and more people to do it with  During the thirties especially  cultivators had an extremely bad time  It was precisely when prices were very low  they were obliged to mobilise and sell all the grain they could grow in order to meet their money obligations which were then very heavy  Getting in the extra quantity of grain was much more important then  than it had been during the last decade  There may  therefore  have been something in thisthough it is very difficult to put a figure on it   Thirdly   It seems likely that a progressive reduction of wastage of grain and its use as cattle feed might have occurred  Some old estimates supplied to the Famine Commsission of 1880  which will be found in ApPENDIX V  seem extremely generous today  It is common experience that people teRd to waste more when they have more to waste  Fourthly   It may be that  as population increased under conditions of growing food shortage  the average rate of oonsumption has also fallen  Is this likely   It is generally believed  with fairly good reason  that cultivators throughout tbe COWltry have been eating better during the last decade than during the preceding decade  The results of some diet surveys made within the last ten years lend support to this belief  During the thirties  the abnormal faU of prices compelled sales of grain which might have forced cultivators on the margin to stint themselves  This pressure has been wholly removed and along with it   no doubt  the stinting  Except in areas which are liable to drought  cultivating labourers are in a stronger bargaining position vis a vis cultivators than they used to be  and it is likely that they are less underfed than they used to be  In areas where prohibition has worked successfully  it is likely that there has been an increase of purchasing capacity and better consumption of grain  All these are indications to the contrary  At the same time there has been a very large ·growth of urban population  The average level of grain consumption in towns is lower than in villages  It is possible that the migrants from villages to towns are more largely drawn from the poorest classes of villagers  and they may  174  \fGROWTH OF FOOD SHORTAGE  have relatively lower rates of grain consumption  On a balance of all considerations  it seems likely that  When population grows in number in conditions of growing food shortage the average level of food consumplion does tend 10 jall   that this tendency was probably fully operative during the thirties and that it probably continued to be operative during the forties also  though not perhaps to the same extent as during the thirties   175  \f\fCHAPTER V  The Prospect I 98 I A   Future Growth of Population the world  Great Britain has perhaps the largest assembO lage of the mostinreliable population data  extending in a systematic timeF ALL COUNTRIES  series over the longest period in the past  Yet when the Royal Commission on population set out to  examine the facts relating to the present population trends in Great Britain   to investigate the causes of these trends and to consider their probable consequences   to consider what measures  if any  should be taken in the national interest to influence the future trend of population and to make recommendations   it found the data insufficient in material particulars  So  arrangements were made for special enquiries to be conducted in order to provide the additional information required by the Commission  After a thorough analysis and prolonged study of abundant material  the Commission achieved a forecast of the future growth of population  Before setting out and discussing the forecast  the Commission made the following preliminary observations    In this and the following chapter we shall try to follow the trend of population some way into the future  Our first and main concern wj l be to explore the prospects of natural increase  Making the asswnption that there is no net migration  we shall seek to find out how the population might develop under the influence of fertility and mortality alone          We shal1 have to begin by looking at the existing population  which naturally conditions future possibilities  We shall be led thereby into a consideration of the number of probable survivors at various future dates of the population now living  and for this purpose it will be necessary to make some assumptiom about future deaths  We shall have  therefore  to consider in the light of palt history and present knowledge what seems likely to be the trend of mortality rates in future  To complete the picture it will be necessary to have figures for the nUJl1bers in the age groups not yet born  and this involves forecasting future fertility rates  The analysis we have made of the past suggests that this will have to be taken in two stages   I  forecasting the number of married couples and  2  forecasting marital fertility rates  We must emphasize that we do not use the word  forecast  here in the sense of confident prediction   the procedure will rather be to work out the consequences of variOUl alternatives within the  177  \fCHAPTER V   THE PROSPECT I98I  bounds of reasonable probability  It i   when we come to the foreca9ting of births that the  e bounds are widest and the prediction of the numbers of any group containing persons as yet unborn is  therefore  particularly difficult    The passage has been reproduced because it explains clearly what is involved in the attempt to peer into the future in order to form an opinion about future numbers  the nature of the data required for the attempt and the strictly conditional nature of the results to be expected  We shall presently see the application of these observations to ourselves  It is  however  not irrelevant for purposes of this report to set out at this stage the forecast made by the Commission of the future of the British population  2   3  The total population of Great Britain had been 105 lakhs in 1801  This had grown  at an enormously rapid rate  to 370 lakhs in 1901  The 195 1 Census showed the number had grown further  though more slowly  to 488 lakhs  The Commission  making its calculations in 1947  looked into the future for a century ahead  It made three clifferent assumptions which led to three different conclusions as below   TABLE 1  IN LAKHS   Year  First assumption  assumption  Third assumption  1962  502  499  508  1977  50 7  486  518  2007  489  41 5  523  2047  455  296  527  Second  All the three assumptions relate to the future of the  family size   by which term  the Commission refers to the average of the total number of children born to every married woman  on completion of her child bearing period   If the present level  indicated by the actual experience of women who married during the years 1927 to 1938  remained unaltered in future  the rate of growth of population will slow down and stop sometime towards the end of this century and a reduction of numbers will begin  But the reduction will be small  there would be 455 lakhs in 2047  But if the tendency to reduction of the  family size  continues further and stability is attained only at four fifths of the present level  then the reduction of nwnbers will start much earlier and occur more rapidly  There would be only 296 lakhs in 2047  If  however  the present level is slightly increased  by 6 per cent unly  and stability is attained at this  178  \fFUTURE GROWTH OF POPULATION  slightly higher level  a slow rate of growth may be kept up for a very long time and the possibility of absolute decline in numbers postponed for at least a century  Accepting these conclusions as data  the Commission then proceeded to discuss the social  economic and other implications of these different possibilities for the future   4  From what has been said earlier in this report  it will be observed that we do not possess population data which can be compared even remotely with those available to the Royal Commission  Our attempt to peer into the future must  therefore  be limited to a relatively short time   and our conclusions must be based on methods of deduction of a much less rigorous nature  To make two simple alternative assumptions first  let us suppose that during each of the TABLE 2 three decades 195 1 60  1961 70 and 1971 80 the mean decermial rate Lower Upper of growth of population will Year limit limit be   a  the same as that of the 3 613 3 613 average of the three decades 195 1 1921 50   or  b  the same as that 0 11 1961 • 4  77 4  9 of the latest of the same three 197 1 • 4 697 4 5 85 decades  when the growth rate 5 276 5 355 was highest   These two assumptions may be regarded as yielding the lower and upper limits  TABLE 2  of the probable future figures  5  The foregoing table shows the results of a very simple  calculation  Another line of approach  which involves somewhat more complioated calculations  yields the figures of TABLE 3 on next page  They represent a forecast for the years 1961  1971 and 1981 of the population of three states  Uttar Pradesh  Madras and Madhya Pradesh  showing the total number  its division into three broad age groups  viz   under 15  15 to 54 and 55 and over   and their subdivision by sexes  The foreca r is based on the following assumptions   First   Apart from the disappeareance of child marriages  there will be no material change in marital or conjugal habits  married women of the same number and the same age will be giving birth to approximately the same number of children during each of  the thirty years 1951 1980 ~ on an  average of the thirty years 1921 50  Second v    The mortality rates in every age group will be approximately the same during each of the next thirty yearf  1951 1980 as on an average of the thirty years 1921 SO       179  \fCHAPTER V  THE PROSPECT lgBI TABLE 3  PofnIIIJIit m  IN nroUSANDS   15 54  0 14  A fIJI s  ~     ~  55 and tIWr  M  P

PROSPECT I jh  to their population during 1921 50  3841akhs  will add 540 lakhs during 1951 80  India had added to its population during 1921 50  1 099 lakhs  Assuming that its growth dwing 1951 80 will bear the same proportion to its growth during 1921 50 as the three states combined  the addition during 1951 80 should be 1 544 lakhs  The figures for growth up to 1971 and 1961 are also arrived at by like reasoning  6  Both types of calculations are of a rough and ready nature  One type of calculation makes some sort of allowance for differences in rates of growth likely to be caused by changes in the age sex pattern  the other type does not  The important thing to note is not the exact figures  for it is no use attempting to forecast in units smaller than a crore  What should be noted is the fact that  if we start with the assumption that the future growth will be limited by the experience of 1921 50  we get by different methods numbers of much the same order   41 crores in 1961  46 crores in 1971 and 52 crores in 1981  We should also note from TABLE 2 that the figures we are likely to get by assuming that future growth will reproduce the experience of 1941  50 throughout the next thirty years would be higher  but not very much higher  Are we right in assuming thaT maternity rates and mortality rates will be the same during the next thirty years  as during the last thirty years  Do we have any indications from past experience which would help us to answer this question  Let us review the pa    t briefly from this point of view  In doing so  we should make a distinction between two quite different sets of questions  We have already seen that the period of thirty years before 1921 differed sharply from the thirty year period since 1921  The difference  as we have seen  consists in the virtual elimination  barring one exception  of deaths from famine and pestilence   and the commencement of a process of significant reduction in what may be called normal mortality  May we assume that these gains are permanent  Or should we accept as a possibility that famine and pestilence may return and the level of normal mortality may rise again  within the next thirty years  Let us dismiss this possibility from our mind for the present and assume that the gains are pennanent  We shall enquire whether  on a comparison of 1921 30 with 1931 40 and the laller with 1941 50  there is such a dtfinite trend as regards changes either of mortal£cy rates or of maternity rates or both that we should expect the growth of population during 1951 80 to be substantially faster or substantially slower than during 1921 50  7  For information on these trends we have to turn to the statistics of registration of births and deaths  which  as already explained  are defective in many ways  In the country as a whole  the system of registration has been 182  \fFUTURE GROWTH OF POPULATION  in force throughout the period 1921 50 in roughly three quarters of the country  on a population basis   The following table shows the numbers of births and deaths which were registered in each of the three decades  as well as the average birth rates and average death rates for each decade derived therefrom  TABLE 5  Decade  Registered births  rN LAKHS   Registered deaths  IN LAKHS   Mean  Mean  decennial birth rate  Registered   decennial death rate

deduced to be 27 2 for the decade 1941 50 when we have already in an earlier chapter  concluded that the correct level is 40  Evidently  32 per cent of all births escaped registration during 1941 50  apart from the fact that the births occurring among a quarter of the popUlation were not attempted to be registered at all   Similarly  the registered deaths yield a death rate of 19  4 when we have reason to believe the true death rate was 27  It follows that 28 per cent of all deaths escaped registration during 1941 50  in the areas where regi  tration was being effected  8  It is usual to assume that the rates derived from the registration data for different years may be compared with one another and correct conclusions drawn regarding time trends even  though the absolute values are incorrect  The assumption would be justified so long as we are dealing with areas in which the omissions are not unduly large and with periods during which the system was worked with much the same degree of efficiency year after year  without any material improvement or deterioration  Whether this assumption holds good of the comparison between 1921 30 and 1931 40 is doubtful  it is certain that it is wholly inapplicable to the comparison between 1931 40 and 1941 5 0 even in those states where the omissions are not unduly large  This negative conclusion is so important that the reasons should be placed on record   First   We may observe from the figures of TABLE 5 that it is not merely the registered birth rates and registered death rates which have fallen  the absolute numbers of registered births and registered deaths have also fallen  This raises the suspicion that what we are witnessing may not be a fall in the number of births but a rise in the number of binhs which have escaped registration   \fCSAP l ER V   Tn MtOSPECT l98l  Seco1tdly   The suspicion is confirmed when we compare the difference between the birth rate and death rate  with the growth rate ascertained by the census  The difference is 7  8 during 1941 50 against a growth rate of 13   I whereas it had been 10· 8 during 1931 40 against a growth rate of 12·7  To put the matter in another way  the registered rates show the birth rate to have fallen more rapidly than the death rate  If we may ignore the effects of migration  this would mean a substantial reduction of the rate of growth  But the census figures show that there was no reduction of the rate of growth  We have good reasons to believe that migration cannot have affected the rate of growth in the country as a whole by even as much as one per cent  though the position is different in certain zones   The figures confirm the suspicion that the system of registration of births and deaths might have been working much Jess efficiently during 1941 50 than in 1931 40  The comparison between the decades may be bringing to light a fall in the registration of births and not necessarily a fall in the actual number of births  The point was specially examined by every Superintendent of Census Operations in relation to conditions in his state  The converging testimony of all officers  which will be found in the State Census Reports  confirms the view that there bas been a definite deterioration in the efficiency of registration  This conclusion need not cause any surprise  During the war and for some years thereafter  the district administrative establishments were loaded with too much new work in connection initially with the prosecution of the war and later increasingly with the problem of keeping food supplies moving and prices under control   Routine  work of every description suffered  including the maintenance of adequate supervision over the staff entrusted with the duties of registration of births and deaths and submission of returns relating to them  Comparison of the data relating to 1921 30 with those of 1931 40 is not vitiated in the same way  though  even here  it seems possible that special efi ortJ undertaken in some areas to improve the efficiency of the system may have also introduced an element of non comparability  9  We may now make the following observations on the figures for India  in TABLE 5       The registered birth rate was the same during 1931 40 as during 1921 30  This is probably true also of the actual birth rate  184  \ftrt Ttt1U GROWTli 0  POpoutIO t  i   The registered death rate during 1931 40 was smaller than that of 192130  There was probably a genuine fall in the actual death rate   ia  There are large reductions  both in the registered birth rates and registered death rates  when we compare 1941 50 with 1931 40  the reduction of the registered birth rate actually exceeding that of the registred death rate  It should not be supposed that the true birth rates and true death rates changed in this manner  It is not possihle to say  from these figures alone  whether they changed at all  and if so  how  Among the states where births and deaths are registered  there are only four in which it has been computed that the omissions are fewer than one in four during 1941 50   and consequently  even smaller  in earlier decades  These are  in order of efficiency of registration  Punjab  Madras  Madhya llradesh a nd Bombay  Let us observe the trends disclosed by the registration data in these states  as shown in the table below   IO   TABLE 6

stationary birth rate   and the other  a significant  though rather small  fall in the death rate  The rise in the birth rate was probably associated with a passing change in the age structure  reflecting the abnormal consequences of selective mortalities of influenza  plague and famine in earlier decades  In some places  e g   North Madras and South  Madras  the rise may be probablY deceptive and indicative merely of the results of special efforts to improve the efficiency of registration   ii  Changes between 1931 40 and 1941 50  The general picture is made up of two features  jirst   there is a fall in the birth rate which consists in part of the cancellation of the rise which had occurred in the earlier decade and in part also of a further fall below the levels reached in 1921 30   and secondly   there is a further drop in the death rate between 1931 40 and 194I 50 which is a shade more pronounced than the drop which had occurred between 1921 30 and I93I 40  Where an earlier increase in the birth rate  or death rate  had been due to improvement in the registration of births and deaths  it is almost certain that the improvement was not maintained and a set back occurred  To this extent  there was no real change in either decade  It is also possible that  even where there was no special improvement originally  deterioration in registration has occurred in the last decade and has exaggerated the trends  After making due allowance for such vagaries of registration  it is difficult to rule out the possibility that the true birth rate of 1921 30 might have been a little higher than the true birth rate of 1941 50  viz   40   We should accept it as probable that there has  in fact  been a small reduction of the birth rate  We are on much firmer ground about the death rate  The trend of the death rate differs from that of the birth rate in two ways  the former has fallen in both decades successively  whereas the lattet has moved up and down  and  the drop in the death rate is clearly visibile to the naked eye  while that of the birth rate is microscopic  II  The fact that the true death rate of 1941 50 must have been definitely lower than the true death rate of 1921 30 is brought out independently by the Life Tables which have been computed for the two periods  by Shri L  S  VAIDYANATIIANforthefonnerand by Shri S  P  JAIN for the latte1  The life table data are fully discussed in Shri JAIN S report  The salient features are as follows   186  \fFUtURE GROWTH OF POPULAnON  The expectation of life  at any particular age  is a good index of the net result of the incidence of mortality at all subsequent ages  But the nature of the data used for purposes of calculation is such that a good deal of guess work enters into this factor at very young ages  The values of expectation of Hfe at birth must  therefore  be treated with some reserve   but the values for expectation of life at higher ages may be relied upon more confidently  The relevant figures are shown below   TABLE 7  I   21 30  Expectation of life at binh  26 years and  Expectation of life at age 10  36 years and 5 months  I I months  1941 50  Increase ift expecraticm of life during 2Q years  32 years and 5 years and 6 months 5 months 39 years  2 years and 7 months  These figures leave no room for doubt that there has been a significant increase in the expectation of life  which is the same thing a    a significant decline of mortality rates  This conclusion indicates a trend of which we should take notice when making estimates of future growth  But before following up that point  a brief digression is necessary in order to prevent the possibility of any sense of complacency arising out of our finding that the death rate has  in fact  fallen and the expectation of life has increased  12  The expectation of life at age 10 is 59 0 to 60 in England  and Wales  Australia and New Zealand  It is 56 in the United States of America  about 50 in Japan and 47 in Egypt  It is now 39 in India  We continue to retain the unpleasant distinction of having the lowest expectation of life among all the peoples for whom figures are available   13  We should also remember that preventable deaths continue to occur in especially heavy numbers among infants and young children under age 5  Our infonnation about mortality rates at different ages is very poor  The best judgment which the present writer is able to form on this subject from available data is furnished in TABLE 8 on next page   \fCHAPtER V   THE PROSPEct 1gB1 TABLE 8  Number of deaths

judgment  it will be seen that the number of deaths occurring undel  age 5 equals or exceeds the number of deaths occurring at all ages between 5 and 54  and is substantially in excess of the deaths occurring among elderly persons aged 55 and over   14· The mortality of children under age 5 is heavy  Among them the mortality of infants  who die before they complete one year of age  is especially heavy  It is true that our infant monality rate is diminishing  During the decade ending 193 I  it was 176 infant deaths per 1 000 births  During the next decade  it was 164  During the last decade  it was 152  These are the figures based on registration  When we allow for omissions in registration  which are almost certainly more numerous among infants who die shortly after birth than among infants who survive   the true rates would probably be higher than these figures  which are  even as they stand  extreme y high   We have seen that out oj 27 deaths of persons of all ages  which occur annually among 1 000 persons in India  11 deaths occur among children under 5 years of age  Out oj these 11 deaths  it is almost certain that  occur among infants who have not completed om year of age  This appalling waste of life and maternal suffering  so largely preventable  goes on day after day in all parts of the country   Madhya Pradesh seems to have an unenviable distinction  Whereas in the country as a whole  40 child births occur every year among 1 000 people  Madhya Pradesh has 44  Whereas in the country as a flJhoie  7 infants die before they are one year old  the number in Mudhya Pradesh is 11  The entire excess of births is matched by an equal excess of infant deaths  t88  \fFUTURE GROWTH OF POPULATION  15  Let us now leave these tmpleasant figures behind and resume our discussion of trends during the last three decades  We may be satisfied that there has been a real drop in the death rate from decade to decade  The drops are real though they are small  They reflect the modest success  which has  undoubtedly been achieved in successive decades  in reducing the incidence of premature death of the type which is normal in our country  What about the rise and fall of the birth rates  from which we concluded that there was perhaps a net diminution of the birth rate to a small extent dwing 1941 50 as compared with the level of 1921 301 The changes would appear to be attributable to two causes of which one is indicated by the figures in the table below   TABLE 9  Number of married females per 1 000 persons of both sexes and all ages in ~     Madras  Bombay  73 71

is arithmetical mean of two figures computed from the data relating to the censUSes at the beginning and end of the decade   It will be observed that the figures of Madhya Pradesh  Bombay and Uttar Pradesh show significant increases in the numbers of married women of child  bearing age from 1921 30 to 1931 40  while those of Madhya Pradesh and Madras show significant decreases from 1931 40 to  1941 50  A detailed analysis of such changes in Madhya Pradesh  the analysis took into account changes within natural diVisions  shows that they must be du~ to the distortions caused by selective  mortality inflicted by the great influenza epidemic on I generation  189  I  \fCHAPTER V   THE PROSPECT I  81  whose age structure had been distorted by the great famines of the deal~ 1891  1900  There is little doubt that  where there are real ups and downs m the birth rate  and not merely ups and downs in the efficiency o~ registration of births   the principal operative cause has been the changes m the age sex structure arising in the manner just described  That is probably the correct explanation of the ups and downs of the binh rate  But is it a complete explanation also of the finding that there is a net resultant drop  It is very difficult to say  It is not impossible that the average age of marriage of girls may have risen somewhat and caused this net resultant drop  The rise in the age of marriage may have come about  as a result of the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929  even though  as pointed out in an earlier chapter  the law still continues to be disregarded by quite considerable numbers of people in many parts of India  It must be borne in mind  however  that the net resultant drop  for which an explanation is sought  is so very small that the reality of its existence has to be established by elaborate argument  16  In the light of this review of the past what do we infer about the future    So far as maternity is concerned  our assessment of the past does not indicate a trend which would justify us in assuming any very materially different future unless something happens which leads to the wide spread adoption of contraception  a contingency which we shall reserve for later discussion  The position is different about mortality  Our assessment of the past would justifY Us in assuming that a further decline of mortality might take place in the next thirty years  It is perfectly obvious that a large proportion of deaths which occur at present are preventable  There is  therefore  quite considerable scope for reduction of mortality  especially among infants and very young children  It jollows that  unless the rate oj growth oj populatz on is checked by contraception ur a breakdown of food supply of such a serious nature as to entail a return to the abnormal mortality TABLE 10 conditions of 1891 1900  population will increase during 1951 80 at a Population faster rate than during 1921 50  YeaT  IN CRORES  Nevertheless  it is expedient for purposes of further discussion that we should accept a furecast which errs on J 17 J • the side of under statement rather 1981 •  than the contrary  With reference to the two sets of figures already mentioned  in TABLES 2   4  let us finally assume  hat the future growth of population will be as shOfDn in TABU 10  Igo  \fFUTURE GROWTH OF POPULATION  17· We have seen that during the three decades before 1951  cultivation per cap£za has been steadily declining and food shortage growing  We shall examine  in the last section  whether these tendencies will be arrested and reversed during the next three decades  In doing so we shall endeavour to  think quanutatively  Shall we be able to develop agriculture so as to keep pace atk the numbers specified in TABLE IO  That is the question we shall seek to answer  Before we start  let us be quite clear about this  our growth in numbers may prove to be even faster than is shown by TABLE 10  It will not be slower  It is nearly as certain as any prediction can possibly be that our number will rise to 52 crores round about 1981  unless any of the two developments occurred beforehand  The first of these conceivable developments may be described as the  catastrophe   Our food shortage which has grown in the past  in the manner described in the last chapter  might  if permitted  grow still further  with the result that the distribution of food supplies might breakdown  as it did in 1943  in Bengal   If this happens over extensive areas for a few years in succession  it will bring in its wake famine and epidemic diseases on the scale which prevailed during 1891 1900  Our assumption that 1951 80 will be governed by the trends of 1921 50 in respect of mortality  would have broken down  The second contingency may be described as the  near miracle   Our womenfolk might begin to practise contraception and voluntarily limit childbearing  as they are doing in Western European countries today  In that case  our assumption that 1951 80 will be governed by the trends of 1921 50 in respect of maternity  would have broken down  IS  If we assume  as most people would like to do  that the  catastrophe  will not be permitted to occur and that the  near miracle  should not also be counted on  then we are committed to the development of agriculture at a rate sufficient to feed at least 52 crores of people in 19SI  Can we do this  The answer to this question  according to the best judgment of the present writer is in the negative  The reasons are explained in the next section  The conclusion is then drawn that we must count on the  near miracale  and bring it about while we a1 f developinb agriculture as fast as we can  This view is explained in the next succeeding section of this chapter   191  \fCHAPTER V   THE PR05PECT I9~h  B   Agricultural Productivity  development targets 19  When we discuss agricultural development and frame programmes and targets therefor  it is convenient to use two different terms   productivity  and  production   to signify two different things  We often hear  for instance  of planning the production of rice or wheat so as to get so many lakhs of tons in such and such a year  But that is not possible  It may be possible to plan ahead the production of a particular year in mines or factories  but it is not possible to do it on farms  For  the monsoons are  at any rate at present  beyond the control of man  The vicissitudes of the seasons alter the yield of crops  from one year to the next  by much larger amounts than any increase which can be brought about by human contrivance within the same time  This does not mean that agricultural development cannot be achieved by planning  On the contrary  we have perhaps reached a stage in the development of agriculture when further development is unlikely to occur on any significant scale without planning and state aid  But we should be clear that what we seek to increase by planned develop ment is not the production of any particular year  but the  average level of production   above and below whkh the production of particular year fluctuates in response to seasonal conditions  Much error and confusion will be avoided if this distinction is borne in mind more firmly than it is at present  Let us use the term  productivity  to refer to this  average level of production   in order to emphasize the fact that we are not referring to the producticm of particular years   It i~ useful to ~o a step further and dot the i s md cros~ the t s of the definition of  productivity  so that it might become possible to measure it like the birth rate or the death rate or similar useful statistical concepts  A difficulty is presented by the fact that the same land is used in different seasons  sometimes even simultaneously  to grow different crops  When we raise the productivity of a plot of agricultural land  we can grow more rice or more jute  more millets or more cotton  more or less as needed  Development of productivity is one thing  and the allocation of increased productivity to different alternative uses is another  It is not unusual for people to imagine that productivity has been increased when there is merely diversion from  say  short staple cotton to millets or from mHlets to groundnuts  We cannot add up the weight of different crops and arrive at a single total of the combined weight of all crops  So we need a conventional method of establishing equivalence between different crops in order to i ll rive at a single yardstick for the measurement of productivity  20   192  \fAGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY   DEVELOPMENT TARGETS  Let us accept two conventions  First    all foodgrains  when they are clean  dry  dehusked and fit for human consumption  may be regarded as equivalent to one another  maund for maund  and added up on that basis  Secondly   the productivity of any plot of agricultural land is the weight of the average annual yield  less seed   of foodgrains actually grown on such land   provided that where a crop other than a foodgrain is grown  it is assumed that the foodgrains normally grown on such land or similar land in the vicinity had been grown instead  21  With the help of these conventions we may fix the present level of ~roductivity of agriculture in India as follows  We have already assumedt the average yield  less  ced  of foodgrains cultivated in India  as an average of five years preceding 1951  was 556 lakhs of tons  The gross area sown to foodgrains is 78 per cent of the gross area sown to all crops  The total productivity may therefore be assumed as  556 X 100 78  i e   700 lakhs of ANNUAL tons  22  Seven hundred lakhs of ANNUAL tons round about 1951 is then our starting point  when our total number was 36 crores  What is the level of productivity needed round about 1981  when we expect our number to have grown to 52 crores  Before we estimate this  however  we should take note of the shortages which were present round about 1951  The shortage of food grains has already been estimated  Round about 1951  the annual average was 34 lakhs of tons  There are known to be shortages of smaller order in other crops also  Let us  therefore  assume in round  figures lhal 750 lakhs of ANNUAL tons of agricultural productivity are required in order to feed and clothe  36 crores of people oJ the cun ent levels of consumption  This is the same thing a8 saying 5 ANNUAL lOns are required for every 24 persons  At this rate  we can compute what we shall need by way of agricultural productivity in 1961 when we shall be 41 crores  in 1971 when we shall be 46 crores   and in 1981 when we shall be 52 croresif we are to overcome existing shortages and maintain current levels oj consumption without deterioration  The results are shown in TABLE lIon next page    It is very neceuary that seed should be deducted from the Jr081 yield  amona other reuOl1I  bec Ule the proportion of seed to gross yield is  very different for~di1ferel1t araiQ4   tft  ~pter IV  para 6 H anc   ¥l BNP    y   \fCHAPTER V    THE PROSPECT 1gB  TABLE  II  Needed agricultural Population  Targetloj ckvelopment of

popUlation grows  our agricultural productivity must also grow  Our target for de Oelopment is  therefore  a movz ng target which is indicated by the figures of the last column oj TABLE 1I  If we express these figures as percentages of the level of productivity prevailing in India round about 1951  viz   700 lakhs of ANNUAL tons   we may say that the increase required is of the ordt f  of 21 per cent before 1961  37 per cent before 1971 and 54 per cent before 1981  Let us recall the fact that we have taken care to avoid over estimating either the probable increase of numbers or the probable requirements of foodgrains per head of popUlation or the probable proportion of all crops to foodgrains   The targets set out in TABLE II are  therefore  minimal estimates of the scale and tempo of development which are essential if existing shortages are to be overcome and if we are to supply the food and cloth needed by our growing numbers out of the produce of our land  If our future rate of development of agricultural productivity falls short of these targets we must expect to have less food and cloth to go round for all  or to have to import more foodgrains or more cotton or both  24  No one is likely to dispute these statements  In fact  everyone is anxious to see that agricultural productivity is developed as rapidly as possible   The Central Government and all the State Governments are concentrating their ·The last mentioned point is especially important  The high proportion of foodgrains  especially cereals  to all crops in our cultivation reflects the high proportion offoodgrains  especially cereals  in our diet  Ifwe  1r~ to hwc m  rc vegetable oil and m  re gh~e  more milk or butter milk  more vegetables and fruits  more sugar and spices in our food  and more   f these 8rc badly needed if We 8re to have better nutrition  we should increase the proportion of foodcrops other than foodgrains  At present we cannot do this because any increase in such crops cannor be secured except or Ihe c  sr 0  a more tnan commensurate loss 0  cereals  which WI  cannot afford  The point should  however  be noted that the targets of development Rpecifi~d in T

energies on it  Our First Five Year Plan  it is well known  has placed the programmes needed for this development in the forefront  About 45 per cent of the planned expenditure on all development schemes is earmarked for the development of agriculture  irrigation and power  Funds necessary for these purposes  it is agreed  are tv be made available on a very high priority  What is not  however  equally clear is whether the schemes are sufficient to solve our problem  Let us examine how far the schemes included in the Plan will take us towards the attainment of the targets of TABLE II  How much will remain to be provided by future Five Year Plans    25  The most reliable as well as the most durable of all the methods of increasing agricultural productivity is to increase the irrigated area  This involves construction of new irrigation works or improvement of existing irrigation works  It is well known that schemes for the development of irrigation are placed in the forefront of all schemes for the development of agricultural productivity in the First Five Year Plan  All are familar with the great multipurpose river valley projects  as well as numerous other irrigation projects  major and minor  which are either under construction or arc about to be undenaken  Though they are well known  it is to be doubted whether there is a correct quantitative perception of the scale of the undertaking or realisation of the fact that  in the literal sense of the phrase  it is altogether unprecedente of in the history of the world  To begin with  we are far too apt to imagine that our country is poorly equipped with irrigaton  as compared with other countries of the world  From this it is deduced that we have a much larger leeway to make up than other COWltries  This is entirely wrong  We can have a correct idea of the immensity of the task which we have Wldertaken only if we realise the truth  which iswe have already gone very far in developing the use  of usable resources of water  just as we have already gone very far in developing the use of usable resources of land  Unfortunately  the true position calmot be established by figures because it is very difficult to get hold of comparable statistics of irrigated area in different countries  Such figures as there are go to show that India irrigates a higher proportion of its crops than the world as a whole and that probably no other large country except China irrigates a higher proportion  In particular  the proportion of irrigated area to gross area sown is much smaller in Europe or North America than in India  The relevant figures for India  round about 1951  are given below 26   India s cultivated land now measures 2 867 lakhs of acres  The gross area sown is just over 3 244 lakhs of acres  the clifference being the area sown more 195  \fCltAPTER V  TlIE PRosmct 1 g8l    than once during the same year   Out of 3 244lakhs of acres sown  the crops on no less than 503 lakhs of acres are irrigated  The irrigated area is thus 15 5 per cent of the total area sown  The proprotion of irrigated area for different zones is shown in the table below  TABLE  12  27  We must have some idea of the rate at which irrigation has developed in the past if we are to Zone assess correctly the scale of the effort we are making for the future  North India 23 4 How many of the works which at East India present provide irrigation for 5 South India West India crores of acres antedate British rule Central India   we have no means of computing  North West India • It is certain that some of them are well over two thousand years INDIA old  It is probable the greater part of the present irrigated area bad been brought under irrigation long before British rule  It is  however  characteristic of irrigation works that they fall into disrepair and disuse in times of anarchy and misrule and get restored and improved under conditions of settled administration  There is little doubt that a good deal of restoration and improvement of this nature has taken place during the last century  It is also certain that considerable development has also occurred through the construction of private wells and other small scale works undertaken by farmers themselves  Such development was also fostered by the grant of loans and concessions in respect of land revenue and rent  In addition to all this  it is a fact that very large areas were newly brought under irrigation by major irrigation projectS constructed as public enterprises within the last century  Percentage of irrigated area to area sown·  We have got detailed and accurate informaton about this  It has been reckoned that the total area irrigated by public works projects  for which capital and revenue accounts have been maintained  is 291 lakhs of acres in undivided India  Out of this  it is estimated that 142 lakhs of acres are in areas now in PakisWl  The development of irrigation  within India in its p~esent limits  was 14 9 lakbs of acres  It took roughly a century for this development to  The area of cultivated land  or net area sown  should be distinguished from the total  or gross  area sown  Similarly the area of irrigated land is distinguishable from tbe total area irri8llted  The most appropriate comparison is between the total area irrigated and the total area sown   196  \fAGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY   DEVELOPMENT

should not imagine this involves arbitrary preference for some areas and neglect of others  North India  North West India and South India presented much better scope for profitable development than West India and Central India  East India was better provided by nature with rainfall and soil moisture than other zones and was less in need of new works of irrigation  28  We must not under estimate the scale of the effort which the figures of We can appreciate how large an undertalting it was  if we compare this history of development with that of the United States of America as indicated by the following passage from the report of the Hoover Commission   TABLE 13 stand for      At the time  the great multi purpose projects were inaugurated  the earlier projects of irrigation had been largely completed and were furnishing water to about 2 790 0CJ0 acres  In the 18 years since that time about 1 500 000 acres of additional soil have been brought under irrigation with perhaps another 550 000 acres more benefiting indirectly from the water supplied by the mUlti purpose projects    197  \fCHAPTER V   THE PROSPECT I981  1t  is evident that  the develqpment of irrigation by the construction of large scale public works projects was undertaken in India on a much larger scale and carried out at a much faster pace than in the United States of America   29  Now  z t is scarcely credZ ble but nevertheless true that the First Fz ve Year Plan includes major irri gation projects which are calculated to bring more area under new imgation than the entire area brought under new irri gation by all major irrigati on projects which were constructed duri n~ a century of Brz tish rule  The relevant figures are shown in the table below   TABLE  14  Irrigated area under major projects   IN LAKHS

planning of major irrigation projects is not a new task  The engineers of North West India  North India and South India have got nearly a century of experience to go upon  The projectli may indeed take somewhat lQnger to complete than eager people may desire  The people may take time to adapt the land under these projects to irrigated cultivation  Even after irrigation starts  it may take a little time before the yield increases to the normal level of irrigated crops  Experience shows that we must be prepared for all this  But  there need  be little doubt that the availability of water would have been correctly estimated and the planned extension of i17i gated area Wf  ll  t n jact  take place  31  Now  it may be a lked if all this is now possible  why was it not attempted before  It is necessary that we should ask this question explicitly and make sure that we have answered it correctly  The right answer is to be found in the relation between costs and results  An analysis of costs and results of the old major irrigation projects and the major development plan projects under the First Five Year Plan is made in a note printed as Part B of APl ENDIX VI  The main conclusions are as follows  In the old days  the selection of projects for execution was limited by the consideration that the net revenue return should suffice to render the enterprise a profitable undertaking for the s tate   T~re were well recognised exceptions to the rule  but they were limited   We have discarded this limitation  and hence the large scope for development which we are now using up  It is necessary  however  to face the fact that  with every new advance made in the utilisation of usable water supplies  the real cost  and not merely the money cost  of new works necessary for making a further advance has been increasing  The figures make it quite clear that the  law of diminishing r elurns  i8 in effective operation and that every acre of new  irrigation has lO be subsidt sed by the general tax payer  The diagrams which precede this page illustrate clearly the enormous scale of the development which we have und~rta  ~n  as well as the trend of diminishing returns against which we have to contend  This situation is not peculiar to India  It exists in the United States of America also    India is distinguishable from United States only in tl ~ fact that here the need for an uphHl struggle to get water for irrigation  even at ~tO$S   is very II 1   b more urgent and imperative  32   What is the probable increase of agricultural productivity to be expected when  as planned  these projects are completed and r61 lakhs of acres are brought Wlder irrigation  The detailed data necessary for making a firm estimate  01 Al PBNDtx V  Part B   199  \fCHAPTER V   THE PROSPECT 1gB I  do not seem to be available  From the published papers itlmay be concluded that the schemes postulate an increase  in terms of foodgrains  of about two ANNUAL tons for every 9 acres of new irrigation  This means an increase of agricultural productivity of the order of 361akh c  of ANNUAL tons  It should be mentioned here that we are dealing with the results to be expected  when aU t he major irrigation projects jnc1uded in the First Five Year Plan are completed and the anticipated new irrigation is developed fully  This is not the same as the area likely to be brought under irrigation within the period covered by the First Five Year Plan  As we are not limiting our review to the next two or three years only  we may assume that the planned increase will be forthcoming in gradual instalments year by year  and will be substantially completed before 1961  According to TABLE II  we shall then need 150 lakhs of ANNUAL tons in order to overcome current shortages and keep pace with the growth of population  The contribution secured from all the major irri garion projects w£ll fall slwrt  of one ourth of the total needed  If the scale of our effort is unprecedented  ehe magnitude of our growing need is even more unprecedented  33  But major irrigation projects do not exhaust the provision made for irrigation in the First Five Year Plan  There are  minor irrigation  schemes also  The name is rather deceptive  because the schemes in question are by no means of minor importance  As a matter of fact we shall have to secure an even larger increase of productivity from such schemes than from major irrigation projects   Minor irrigation works are of many different types  dams  channels  ordinary wells  tube wells  other than those included in major irrigation projects   tanks and pumping installations  They include public works to be constructed and maintained by State Governments  8     well as privateworks  which cultivators are to be subsidised and helped to undertake  The schemes of various State Governments added up to a programme designed to yield about 83 lakhs of acres of new irrigation  As this was found to be insufficient  alongw th other measures  to attain immediate future requirements  supplementary provision has been made by the Planning Commission which calls for another 30 lakhs of acres of new irrigation  at an extra cost of 30 crores  Altogether  the minor irrigation programme is designed to increase the irrigated area by 113 lakhs of acres  which is between one~fifth and one fourth of the total area under irrigation in the country   ·This doe  not moan that minor irrigation can be a substiudll for major irription  We thaQ He presently that their co bined output will not b  cnou h   200  \fAGtucULnhut PRODUCTiVITY   D

cultivators with  the help of loans  grants and technical a~sistance  As the figures are not separated  it is difficult to assess the prospects of realisation of the programme within the time and at the unit costs specified  Secondly   In so far as they are public work~ undertaken by State Governments which possess staff experienced in this type of work  it is likely that planning and organisation are sufficiently well advanced and the programme would be carried out  Not all State Governments  however  are equally well equipped with staff possessing the necessary technical qualifications and experience  and Thirdly   The schemes which visualise an offer of financial and other assistance being made by the State Governments in order to stimulate cultivators to sink wells in their holdings or construct dams  or improve dams  channels  embankments  ponds  etc   are of very great importance  But the arrangements necessary for putting such programmes through are not easy  Some State Governments have  inherited a strong enough machinery of administration from the past  They have acquired experience  during several years of  Grow More Food  effort   in the organisation of the administration of such programmes  Many other states lack 2 01  \fCHAPTER V   TIiE PROSPEct  t~ t  these advantages  Unless  however  these arrangements are perfected and efficiently operated in such states also  it may not be possible to spend the money provided or money may be spent without securing an equivalent jncrease of productivity  That is one important consideration  There is another  No scheme ofsubsidisation of private works will succeed unless the subsidy was carefully adjusted  If the subsidy is lavishly given  the development of productivity will be too small in relation to the expenditure  and progress will be too slow and too costly  If  on the other hand  the subsidy is not clearly adequate  it will fail to induce    ultivators to undertake improvements  The subsidy must be sufficient to reduce the net investment by the cultivator to a level at which he could be assured of a profitable return  As large numbers of cultivators have already been induced by loans and subsidies to carry out such works during the last few years  it should be possible to settle  in the light of expcrience  which is the right subsidy to be offered  It would be surprising if the requirements turned out to be smaller than the average rate of Rs  100 per acre provided by the Planning Commission  The cost figures of at least two zones  where much smaller figures are provided~ would seem to call for upward revision  if the indicated   targets are to be attained  34  This programme  it has been reckoned in the report 011 the First Five Year Plan  is calculated to increase productivity by 24 lakhs of ANNUAL tons  From what has been said above  it seems reasonable to conclude that the chances of the entire programme being implemented within the next two or three years are poor  More time will be ~ccessary  and  very probably  more money also  Experience must show the practicable rate of progress and necessry cost  The rate of progress can  indeed  be rapid if adequate administrative  financial and technical arrangements are perfected and the cultivators are properly organised to cooperate with one another ana with the local officers of Government  How to bring about such organisation is a question which admits of no simple or ready made answer  It is known  however  that active steps are being taken to find the answer and perfect the arrangements  For our present purposes  we may  therefore  assume that the two parts of the programme of irrigation development  major irrigation projects at present estimated to cost 445 crores and minor irrigation schemes at present estimated to cost 77 crores  will be put through  and that they will yield  in reasonable time  an increased agricultural productivity of the order of  36 24  i e    60 lakhs of ANNUAL tons  When we have got it   where shall we be  by 1961  2 02  We shall have secured just about tflJo fifths of what roe nud  \fAGRICULTU1tAL P1tOBUCTIVITY   DEVELOPMENT TARGETS  35  Irrigation  of course  is not the only means of increasing yields  There is  fertilisation   the effort to increase the supply of mineral fertilisers as well as organic fertilisers and green manure  This effort merges in the various measures by which cultural practices are improved  the use of the right seed  proper preparation of the seed  bed and care of the seedling  the protection of the Lastly  there are arrangements for growing plant against pests and diseases  etc  reclaiming waste land as well as land which has gone out of cultivation owing to the growth of deep rooted weeds  The latter is closely linked to development of the use of tractors  There is no doubt that every one of these different types of schemes will contribute something towards the attainment of our target  But how much would that contribution be and when shall we get it  In attempting to answer this question  we enter the arena of high debate  for we deal  mostly  in opinion  There are few reliable statistics based on adequate experience in the country  We have  instead  varying moods of optimism and pessimism  Data regarding responses to the use of mineral fertilisers are coming in  in recent years  and we are perhaps already in sight of a firm basis for quantitative assessments   Even then  we should pass beyond the purely technical relationship between quantities of fertilisers and quantities of additional yield  We should count the cost  as we have done about irrigation  We should take account of the arrangements necessary for ensuring that the fertilisers are distributed at a price at which it will be remunerative for the cultivators to use them on the production offoodgrains  Here again  we should face the fact that we are probably up against the impossibility of progress without subsidisation  When we turn from mineral fertilisers to all other measures for the improvement of cultural practices  it is extremely diffk   Ult to achieve a realistic and measurable basis such as we need when we are dealing with the vitally important issue of assessing the prospects of food supply of the people   36  The rest of this section is devoted to a purely subjective assessment  by the present writer  of the prospect for increase of agricultural prodllctivity  The assessment is not based on any statistical projection of  natural  growth   for we may be sure it would be very small  probably negligible  It is assumed that the preponderant part  if not the whole  of future development will be secured as a result of public works which will not be fully self financing  as well as by state aided an l state subsidised private effort on· a nation wide scale  On this basis  the question is not merely  what is technologically feasible  though that is very important   but also how much unremunerative outlay  md how much ~ l bsidr are invo~ved  The idea that development can be achieved without ~j  \fCHAPTER V   THE PROSPECT 1981  COWlting the cost is Wlpractical  Concentration on subsidised development of agricultural productivity will involve a co~ponding retardation of the effort to improve communications  housing  hygiene  health  education and the amenities of life  There are limits to the extent to which such developments can be retarded without creating so much disappointment and discontent as to prejudice the success of the whole conception of planned development  37  Our present level of gross area sown  reckoning the double crop area more than once  is 32 crores  What is it likely to be in 1981  It is suggested that 35 crores is probably about the limit  We have found  in Chapter I  good reasons for believing that India has already brought under cultivation an exceptionally large proportion of usable land  It is common knowledge that over very large areas  land which should have been reserved for use as woodland or pasture has been brought under the plough  In a great many villagt S we shall indeed need Q carefully organised survey of waste lands  in order to localire all the areas which it would still be possible to reclaim and bring under cultivation without excessive subsidisation  In the course of such suroey we shall have to ascertain the different forms of state aid necessary for bringing them under cultivation  It would  however  be unjustified optimism to imagine that very latge areas of land which would yield a return commensurate with the labour of cultivation  even after subsidised reclamation   will be found very quickly  Progress in this respect  will be both small and slow  It is possible to increase crop acreages  without extension of cultivation to waste land  if we can increase double cropping  Here again we already have a very large proportion under dOUble cropping  The duration of soil moisture is the principal limiting factor and it is doubtful whether there can be much increase  except pari passu with the growth of irrigation  especially irrigation under private wells   The assumption that the crop acreage under both heads can be increased by 3 crores of acres before 1981 is probably optimistic  but not perhaps un ustifiably so  Let us make it  What would be the resultant increase of productivity  We should assume a rate res presenting the average of the lower range of yields of unirrigated crops at current standards of husbandry  It is necessary to do this  because estimates of increased productivity consequent on irrigation or other measures for increasing ~he yield rate per acre should be made separately and no item should be counted twice  On this basis  estimate of increase by one ANNUAl  ton on every 8 acres newly added to our crop acreage would perhaps err on the side of optimism  Let us assume it   and count an increase of agricultural productivity of the or4er of 40 lakhs of ANNU ~ tQ~1 ~4  \fAGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY   DEVELOPMENT TARGETS  38  We have reviewed the facts and figures about irrigation at considerable length  We have now got 5 crores of acres of irrigated crops  How many acres of irrigated crops shall we have in 1981  The First Five Year Plan budgets for an increase of irrigated area of the order of 2 • 8 crores of acres  The budgeted increase is certainly feasible  though not within the time  There will also  no doubt  be scope for further increases  Let us take a long term view  in the full knowledge that every lakh of acres newly added to the irrigated area will render the addition of another lakh more difficult and more costly  What shall we assume as the final result of this uphill struggle  4 crores of acres   Shall we succeed in increasing the irrigated area of about 5 crores of acres  built up during some thousands ofyears   by about 80 per cent  to about 9 crores within the next thirty years  Let us assume that we set this long term target for ourselves and attain it  through a succession of Five Year Plans  What would be the result  If we attribute to irrigation the difference between the average yield of irrigated crops and the average yield of un irrigated crops  we would be justified in taking credit for one ANNUAL ton fOT every five new acres of irrigation    In this  we do not take credit for better manuring or other improvement of cultural practices  This comes later   We shall get a total increase of productivity of the order of 80 lakh ANNUAL tons by irrigation  Let us add this to the result of increasing crop acreage  already mentioned  We shall get increased productivity of the order of 120 lakhs of ANNUAL tons  39  Let us now take into account all other methods of increasing the yield per acre  mineral fertilisers   green manuring  better rotations calculated to improve soH fertility  the so called Japanese method of rice cultivaton   improved seeds  already known    improved seeds which may be expected to be thrown up by research within the next ten years  contour bunding and dry farming  better protection against pests and diseases  and greater care and attention to all the processes of cultivation  Everyone of these measures will undoubtedly help  We should count on them  but we should not count on them indefinitely  In particular  we should refrain from making a double count of the results attributable to irrigation and to manures  once separately  and once again when assessing the value of particular methods of improving yields per acre  We should steer clear of a common mistake wJ  ich clmSists in  confusing these imprO Vements of methods of cultivation which enable us to secure the same yield per acre with less labour  with others which help to increase the yield per acre  The former  however beneficial  are not relevant to the present discussion   Finally  there is the tendency to attribute increased  ·If land is reclaimed Crom waste and is also brought

ownership and management of land  What sort of land reform is calculated to improve farming efficiency is a question on which diverse views are  and will continue to be  held  But we should be careful to distinguish between efficiency in the realisation of technologicial possibilities which otherwise exist  and the creation of new possibilities  No measures of land reform will add to the teclmological possibilities of cultivation  Well   conceived reforms will remove impediments to their realisation   illconceived changes will create new impediments  Let us not put  co operative fanning   collectivization    redistribution of land  and so forth in the same category as water  manures  and improved seed and add up targets of increases attributed to each of them separately  The upshot of all the genuine possibilities which do certainly exist cannot  in the opinion of the present writer  be put higher than the combined effect of the two targets already mentioned  i  e   12 olakhs of ANNUAL tons  The scale of effort needed to secure this result may be indicated by the break up of the total into three equal parts as shown below  Firsl   Forty lakhs of ANNUAL tons to be secured by concentrating the use of mineral fertilisers  whose use can be stepped up considerably with advantage  improved seeds and improved cultural methods from about 2 crores of acres of land having an assured supply of water   Secondly   Forty lakhs of ANNUAL tons to be secured in the same way as above but without the concentrated use of mineral fertilisers  from about 4 crores of acres of land having a reasonably satisfactory supply of water   and Thi rdly   Farty lakhs of ANNUAL tons to be secured by better cultivation of about 8 crores of acres of unirrigated land situated in areas with low rainfall  This is the most conjectural item  because known methods  e g   contour bunding and dry fanning  might not suffice for this purpose  On the other hand  if intensive research could give us some improved seed similar to the  hybrid com  of America  the proposed programme may be over fulfilled   40  At the end of all this  our estimate 01 mcrease of agricultural productiVIty is still only 240 lakhs of ANNUAL tons  of which one sixth is to be secured by increase of acreage under crop  one third by increase of acreage under irrigation   and one half by all methods of increasing yield per acre other than irrigation  This increase will fall short of our needs before 1971  It will be just about sufficient to overcome the present shortages and meet our growing needs Imtil our number reached 45 crores  which will occur rOWld about 1969  By that time we shall have completed three successive Five~ Year Plans   2®  \fIMPROVIDENT MATERNITY   REDUCTIo   TARGETS  each more difficult than its predeamor  and embarked on the fourth  If even then  our population is still growing unchecked  what are the prospects of our being able to continue to force the development of agricultural ptoduCti TJtY so as to keep pace with it  Of course  there will never be a point of time at which it can be said that tbe last improvement has been effected  But if we draw the moral correctly from the many unmistakable signs which go to sh J W that the law of diminishing returns is in effective operation  we should make up our mind to face the fact that our effort to keep pace with unchecked grOfOth of populca on is bound to fail at some point  If the analysis of the subject contained in tbis chapter is even approximately valid  we should be able to go one 8tep further andfix this point by saying that it is the time at which our total number reaches and  passes 4tJlcrores   C    Improvident Maternity   reduction targets  us ACCEPT the position that we shall not be able to overcome our existing shortages and also in addition keep pace with the unchecked growth of population  Then  what follows  that food shortage will grow and grow until it ends in a breakdown of food distribution and return of famine and pestilence   That is indeed a dark prospect which 1943 warns us to face as a possibility  But not all events which are possible are probable  and very few are inevitable  After all  we have been failing to keep pace with the growth of population for about thirty years and the life of the people is still being carried on  though not without visible adverse results  We must study the trend of these results in the past  in ordet to have a realistic idea of what to expect in futute  LBT  42  First  it is certain that if agricultural productivity fails to keep pace with the growth of population  our need for imported foodgrains will incrense steadily  We may do with a little less in a year following a good monsoon  and need a little more in a year following a bad one   but there is a norm above and below which these fluctuations· take place  It is this DOrm which has 8teadily increased during the past 30 years   and it is certain to go up in the future also   lllless the development of productivity keeps pace with the growth of population  Round about 1951  we reckoned that the average shortage offoodgraitls required to be ·In identally  tn se y~ It to year ll~ tUltioIl9 in import needs win be only a Craction ohbc year to year ll  ctulltiODS of productioQ   \fCHAPtER V   THE PIWSl ECt IgSI  their exportable surpluses tend to become less abundant  • Food importing countries tend to increase  as also the quantities they need to buy  In these circumstances  food importing countries should  in their own interests  limit their demands volunta  tily  co operate in buying available supplies at fair prices and sharing them equitably according to need  If instead of doing this  they adopt the policy mentioned above   Vi    to force the exports of industrial products and rely on the purchasing power thus acquired in order to back steadily increasing demands for food  they would only succeed in injuring themselves  The supplies available for international distribution will remain much the same   the price of food will go up and increasing quantities of industrial products will have to be sold in order to procure the same amount of food  Available supplies will be distributed unfairly and the industrially weakest will go to the wall  however urgent their need  These results arc bound to follow unless the food exporting countries of the world increase agricultural productivity at a faster rate than their own rate of growth of popUlation  and produce increasing surpluses to match increasing def£cits in India and Europe  This will not happen  It follows that industrialisation is not the answer to the food problem   the widespread belief to the contrary is a fallacy  based on a misreading of history   This does not mean that development of industry is unnecessary or unimportant  Far from it  But  we should be clear about why we need it  W need it  in order to provide ourselves with those goods and services which add to the comforts and conveniences of life and to make ljfe and work less laborious  Industrialisation will not help to solve our food problem  except indirectly to a limited extent in so far as it can provide the materials needed for the development of agricultural productivity   45  So then  we have reached two conclusions  One is   that we cannot grow as much food as we shall need  if we go on increasing in numbers as we do  The other is   that ifwe do not grow more food  we must eat less food  What follows  that starvation is our lot  No  It follows that we should make up our mind that we shall not go on increasing in numbers as we do  We should realise that it is improvident on our part to permit ourselves to increase in numbers indefinitely without taking thought of how our children and our children s children are to live  and we should resolve to put an end to this increase as soon as possible  • Relevant data OD this phenomena will be found in  ApPllNDlX V  The

is all very well  We may resolve on what we please  That is easy enough  But can this resolve be put into execution   Is it possible to bring about a substantial reduction of the rate of growth of our numbers  let alone a complete stoppage of increase  sufficiently quickly to make a material difference to the prospect for 1981  which is what we are considering    The last section was devoted to an exposition of the implications of the effort to raise agricultural productivity at a fast enough rate so as to keep pace with the unchecked growth of population  The conclusion was reached that even with the best efforts we would probably succeed in increasing productivity only by about one third of the present level   whereas it is necessary that the increase should be in excess of one half of the present level  if we are to succeed in  keeping pace   That was why we reached the conclusion that the effort to  keep pace  with unchecked growth of population until 1981 was impracticable  How do we know that the effort to limit births and arrest the growth of population is any less impracticable  That is the crucial question we have to answer  Before answering it  let us note and briefly dispose of a few other aspects of this highly contentious subject  47  In recent years  the population problem is debated in almost all countries of the world and very varying views are held  First  there are those who hold that the practice of contraception is sinful  A sinful thing could not be necessary or desirable or other than harmful in every way  Therefore  they feel it their duty to prevent the spread of this practice  As  however  few people are now adays willing to accept prohibitions without explanation  they proceed to explain that the growth of population presents no problem at all or that the problem can be solved in many difl erent ways which will not involve the use of contraception  It would be a mistake to under estimate the force of this taboo  This force does not depend on the soundness of the reasons adduced in support of it  but on the respect which is justly due to religion generally  and to the opinion of all people who are manifestly sincere and disinterested  If we recall the fact that  only recently  the World Health Organisation felt compelled tc  void even considering this subject  we must count it a fortunate circum·      lce that the religious faith of most of our people is not bound up with thi      ~   J It is  therefore  easier for us  while affirming due respect for religion  l  Izln~ljl~  and the integrity of family life  to insist that the question whether cOlltr         ~ii i  l is good or bad for the people shall be considered in the light ofuninrubited l       on   48  Secondly  there are those who arc quite convinced of th  complete absence of any necessity for any effort to restrain the growth of popUlation  the population may grow to any extent  it is always possible to organise their 211  \fCHAPTER V   THE PROSPECT 1gB1  activities in such a wayac  to produce the food and all other goods and services needed for an ever rising standard of living for all of them  To them  it is unnecessary that there should be enough land   the secret of managing with less and less land per capita is simple  collectivize it  But how can we get the same amount offood from less and less land even if the land were to be collectivized  We are told that we may safely leave this to science  It is  it seems  an observed fact that those people who make full use of science develop technology at a faster rate than the growth of population  Collectivization of land plus technology means adequate food for all the people  no matter what the quantitative relation may be between the land and the people  That is the belief  It is not so much a bLlliof in science as sciencolatry  This new religion comes in handy for a school of thought  which is on principle  opposed to admitting that the shortage of land could be an operative cause of poverty at any time  For if it can be operative in future  it might be operative already  If this belief gains ground  it would weaken a political and economic doctrine which attributes the hardships of the poor exclusively to the wickedness of the less poor  And no opinion which has such an effect can be truc  Most people  however  do not reason this out at all  They are concerned with the result  all people should get all the food they need  This is happening in other countries  and they are determined that it must happen in India also  Since science does seem to work wonders in so many other ways  why should it fail in this purpose  To such people  the answer must be    Yes  you are right  But  if you believe in science  you must believe in it fully  Science has placed in your hands the means ot reducing births  just as much as of reducing deaths or of increasing the yield of crops  You should use all of them equally well  You should not combine a scientific approach to agriculture  hygiene and medicine with an unscientific approach to contraception    49  Thirdly  there are those who agree that the growth of populat on should be checked  but maintain that there is no need for the Government to mix themselves up too prominently in such a delicate and controversial matter  All that the Government need do  according to this view  is to concentrate on improving the standard of living of the people  When we attain West European standards of living we shall also have West European birth rates  Some say the reduction of the birth rate will come about by the people adopting contraception of their own accord in order to preserve their high standards of living  Others say that high standards of living  especially an adequate supply of protein food  will induce physiological changes which will bring about a reduction in the number of children born  even without the practice of contraception  Anyway  both schools agree that when the Government have solv~d  th~ 212  \fIMPROVIDENT· MATERNITY   ·REDUCtiON TARGEtS  problem  the people will see to it that the problem stays solved and does not reappear  That is  no doubt  comforting  But what is to happen if it is true that you cannot solve the problem unless you have checked the growth of population beforehand   50  That brings us back to the crucial question of practicability  still to be answered  Which is more difficult  checking the growth of populatioQ or keeping pace with the unchecked growth of population  Obviously  the answer is bound up with the state of public opinion on the subject  It was nearly 37 years ago when Shri P  K  WATIAL  the pioneer of Indian thought on this subject  published his luminous essay  The Population Problem in India   a Census Study   At that time he likened his effort to uthe intrusions on the peace of mind of an occupied and self satisfied public by faddists who put up their umbrellas and insist that it is raining when every good man of the world knows  that the sun is shining   He judged the mood of the public aright  Since then many able writers  scholars  scientists  economists and men of religion have carried on the debate  while the world and India were changing rapidly  and the problem grew and became visible to the naked eye  Within the last few  years  public intcrest has grown enormously  There is widespread and continuous discussion in the press  the platform and among social workers  At the same time  the practice of contraception is beginning to take root among wide sections of the urban intelligentia  the people who are hardest hit by recent economic changes   This movement of public opinion has now acquired coherence  crystallisation and a sense of direction with the publication  by the Planning Commission  oj its report on the First Five Year Plan  51  The views expressed by the Planning Commission are extracted bclow    The recent increase in the population of India nnd the pressure exercised on the limited resources of the country have brought to the forefront the urgency of the problem of family planning and population control  The application of medical knowledge and social care has lowered thc death ratc  while the birthratc rem3ins fairly constant  This has led to the rapid increase in the growth of population  While a lowering of the birth rate may occur as a result of improvements in the standards of living  such improvements are not likely to materialise if there is a concurrent increase of population  It is  therefore  apparent that population control can be achieved only by the reduction of the birth rate to the extent necessary to stabjIize the population at a level consistent with the requirements of national economy  This can be secured only by the ·realisation of the nccd for family limitation on a wide scale by the people  The main appeal for family planning is based on considerations of the health and            21   \fCHAPtER V   THE PROSPECT 1gBI  welfare of the family  Family limitation or spacing of the children is necessary and desirable in order to secure better health for the mother and better care and upbringing of children  Measures directed to this end should  therefore  form part of the public health programme   All progress in this field depends  first  on creating a sufficiently strong motivation in favour of family planning in the minds of the people and  next  on providing the necessary advice and service based on acceptable  effiCient  harmless and economic methods  But these presuppose  J  intensive studies about the attitudes and motivations affecting family size and techniques and procedures for the education of the public on family planning  and  2  field experiments on different methods of family planning as well as medical and technical research   ccA programme for family limitation and population cont~ol should    a  obtain an accurate picture of the factors contributing to the rapid popUla   tion increase in India   b  discover suitable techniques of family planning and devise methods by which knowledge of these techniques can be widely disseminated  and  c  make advice  on family planning  an integral part of the service of Government hospitals and public health agencies   A sum of Rs  65lakhs has been allocated by the Central Government in the Plan  to the Ministry of Health for a family phUUling programme   This programme includes    I  The provision  in Government hospitals and health centres  of advice on methods of family planning for married persons who require such advice  Medical Officers working at hospitals and health centres like maternity and child welfare clinics should give advice to women regarding family planning when such advice is necessary for health reasons  If a doctor feels that a woman patient cannot undergo again the strain of pregnancy and partUrition without danger to health  it is obviously the duty of the doctor to give such advice as is necessary to enable the person to prevent conception  In these circumstances  the doctor would be justified in suggesting any chemical  mechanical or biological methods of oontraception or sterilization 8S may be indicated for the individual case  The giving of advice on birth control has been a procedure allowed by the Ministry of Health in U K  in medical centres maintained by the local authorities   2  Field experiments on different methods of family planning for the  purpose of determining their suitability  acceptability and effectiveness in different sections of the population  Ifit can be demonstrated that our people  particularly those living in rural areas  can be educated to accept the rhythm method and use it as a practical method of limiting family growth  Governmental support should be extended to the propagtltion of this method  From the point of view of avoiding enonnous  \flMplWVIOENT MATERNITY   REOUCtION TARGETS expenditure as well as that of securing the ethical values that community life would gain by the self imposed restraint which the rhythm method involves  it would seem desirable to try out this method fully and thus ascertain hs practicability  Whether the rhythm method is capable of wide application in the community with adequate results Or not  actual experimentation alone can tell  Research and experiments need not however be confined to a single method  There are numerous voluntary agencies which are currently propagating the spread of information on family planning and the use of chemical and mechanical contraceptives  Their activities would need support   3  Development of suitable procedures to educate the people on family planning methods  Inexpensive means of rapidly educating the public in matters relating to family size wiH have to be evolved if large scale reduction in the national birth rate is to be obtained  Scientific tec1miques are available to assess the effect of mass educational campaigns  These techniques should be used to develop educational programmes suitable for the different economic and social sections of the population   4  Collection  from representative sections of the population  of infonnation on reproductive patterns  and on attitudes and motivations affecting the size of the family  The reproductive pattern in any popUlation is largely determined by social and cultural factors which may differ from one area to another  A thorough investigation of the differences in attitudes and motivations towards family size and of the factors responsible for producing such differences is important  Research along these lines is necessary if we arc to understand the particular sentiments and aspirations to which programmes offamily limitation in various sections of the population should appeal    5  Study of the inter relationships between economic  social and population changes   The information obtained by such studies will form the necessary background for the formulation of a national population policy and the development of appropriate measures for population planning based on factual information   6  Collecting and studying information about different methods of family planning  based on scientifically tested experience in India and abroad  and making such information available to professional workers    7  Research into the physiological and medical aspects of human fertility and its control  C It is considered that the problems of popUlation and family planning  may be divided into those relating  0     I  2   Policy and approacb  and  Research and progr mme6   2IS  \fCHAPTER V ~  THE PROSPECT 1gB I  Two committees have accordingly been constituted  It would also appear desirable to set up at a later date a population commission to assess the population problem  consider different views held on the subject of population control  appraise the results of experimental studies and recommend measures in the field of family planning to be adopted by the Government and the people    52  That is as far as we have reached today in the evolution of public opinion about this highly contentious subject  Conflicting voices are still heard  but the ultimate outcome of the debate is no longer in much doubt  People are coming to heliCfJe that population control is necessary and that it is unlikely  to come ahout quickly enough unless Government took some steps to bring it about  That is a great advance  But we are not yet sure how we are going to set about the task of inducing the people to limit births  It seems so visionaryalmost unreal  when we think about the villages which are five sixths of the problem  We are also not very clear in our mind how much time we have in this matter  Perhaps limitation of births is merely a desirable thing to be achieved in due time when it becomes practicable  Or is it something about which it is essential in the national interest that definite results of a measurable character should be achieved within a specified time  We do not know  we are not sure  We have not yet reached the point at which consideration of targets and priorities can be placed on the agenda  But we must look ahead  as far ahead as I98I  and consider targets and priorities  Otherwise  the efforts of Government will prove to be inadequate and halfhearted  The great advance already made in the evolution of public opinion may fail to take us anywhere  53  Our appraisal of the possibilities of development of agricultural productivity has led us to the conclusion that it might be possible to achieve an overall increase of agricultural productivity by about one third of its present level  and this would correspond to the needs of a total population strength of 45 crores  This may be reached sometime round about I969  That would give us a maximum of about I5 years for planned measures to limit births  to become effective and yield results  It is not a very long period for such a large enterprise  but it cannot also be said to be far too short  Let us then define our general aim to be  so to limit the number of births that they do not materially  exceed the number of deaths and thus achieve a substantially stationary population before our number exceeds 45 crores  That would be the first step towards a crystallisation of ideas on targets and priorities  54  Though the objective as thus defined is clear enough  it will serve the purpose of indicating the needed practical measures much better  if it can 218  \fIMPROVIDENT MATERNITY   REDUCTION TARGETS  be put in a form in which every one may perceive his or her own share of the collective obligation  It is in this context that the conception of   improvident maternity   which was touched upon in an earlier chapter  acquires practical importance  The birth rate is something for which respo~ibility can be fastened on no one  But the number of births which occur to a married couple  are  ex hypothesi  controllable by them  Is it possible to specify a maximum  number of child births which every married couple can have without creating a national problem regardin g the future of their offspring  There are reasons to believe that this is possible  and that the number is three  Let us  therefore   define  improvident maternity  as a child   birth occurring to a mother who has already given birth to three or more children  of whom at least one is alive  Let us also define the   incidence of improvident maternity  as the figure obtained by expressing the number of births of this nature as a percentage of all births occurring in any particular area during any particular period of time  A relatively  simple calculation shows that if we can put an end to improvident maternity as thus defined  or at any rate reduce its incidence drastically  the excess of birlhs over deaths will be reduced to negligible 1lUmhers and a substantially stationary population achieved  As this conclusion is important  the relevant calculation should be explained  55  It has been estimated that the incidence of improvident maternity is  at present  somewhere between 40 per cent and 45 per cent in our country  Out of every 40 births which occur among every 1 000 people in the course of one year  17 births are of this naUlfe  Suppose we succeed in inducing the people to avoid such births  Our national birth rate would then fall from 40 to 23  Our national death rate is at present 27  Out of the 27 deaths which occur among 1 000 people in the course of one year there are II children under 5 years of age  of whom 7 are infants who have not completed one year of age  A reduction in the number of births from 40 to 23 is likely  therefore  to be followed by a reduction of these I I deaths to 6  In other words  avoidence of improviden~ maternity will not only reduce the national birth rate from 40 to 23  but it will also reduce the national death rate from 27 to 22 at the same time  The net result will be to reduce the rate of growth of population from about 13 per cent per decade to about one per cent per decade  If improvident maternity is not avoided altogether  but its incidence is very substantially reduced  to  say  5 per rent   we shall still get a birth rate of 25 and a death rate of 23 and a growth rate of only two per cent per decade  When that stage is reached  it is no  Ealie t in this report  0   Chapter 11  para 80   the view hal b  cn exprcssed that such measures IS Eaiiing the age  Of marriage will have only a very limited effect  and caDDot bring about large reduction of the order indicated by these flgure •   21 7  \fCHAPTER V   THE PROSPECT I9BI  doubt likely that further diminution of the death rate might be expected to occur as a result of general improvement of health standards  We may confidently expect this to be offset by further diminution of the birth rate  This will happen because the people who have got rid of improvident maternity will  ex hypothesi  have acquired effective control over child bearing  It will then be easy and natural for them to pass over from avoidance of  improvidence  to positive  prudence   An increasingly large proportion of mothers will limit themselves  of their own accord  to two children without being urged to do so  Thus the fall in the birth rate may be expected to keep pace with the fall in the death rate  56  Let us  therefore  define our objective  not in the general terms already mentioned in paragraph 53  but specifically in relation to improvident maternity  The task before the nation is first of all to bring about such a change in the climate of public opinion that every married couple will accept it as their duty  to themselves  to their family  and to that larger family  the nation  that they should avoid improvident maternity  The occurrence of improvident maternity should evoke social disapproval  as any other form of anti social self indulgence  This is necessary   but not enough  There should be standing arrangements for ensuring that advice is given to every married couple on the various ways open to them for discharging this duty and to make available the necessary facilities  In order to regulate the scale and tempo of planned measures designed to achieve this purpose  the following target should be fixed  The i ncidence of improvident maternity should he reduced from its present level of 0 lJeT 40 per cent to under 5 per cent within 1 5 years  57  It will be noted that we are moving beyond the general statement that it is desirable for mothers to limit the total number of births  to space births  and so on  Approaching the subject from the point of view of national necessity  a single common limit is suggested for all  Consistently with this approach it is immaterial if  in a particular case  the pecuniary circumstances of the family or the state of health of the mother are such that further maternity may be allowed to occur and the offspring supported without much difficulty  Whether or not the individual can afford it  the nation cannot  and hence it is  improvident maternity  all the same  While this must be made clear beyond doubt  it is also necessary to point out that there is  in fact  no conflict in this matter between the interests of the individual  of the family  and of the nation as a whole  No elaborate argument is necessary in order to show that if improvident maternity were universally avoided  no one will be unhappy or worse off  On the other hand  mothers will live longer  healthier and happier liv~  and cbildreD will 2J8  \fIMPROVIDENT MATERNITY   REDUCTION TARGETS  be better fed  better looked after  and acquire an altogether better start in life There will be an enormous reduction in the numbers of infants who die within a year of their birth  If we can convert ourselves to the view that improvident maternity is a form of anti social self indulgence which all of us should avoidand if we can equip ourselves with the knowledge and the material means of avoiding it   we shall have done more to reduce human suffering and promote human happiness than by all other measures of economic and social planning combined  58  Let us suppose that the target for reduction of improvident maternity is accepted  and consider how to set about the task of attaining it  To begin with  we should be careful not to rush into the streets with trumpets and drums in order to preach the new faith and count the converts  There will be need for something of that kind  but in due time  The first phase of the programme of measures must be devoted to thorough preparation  Out of the total of 15 years which are available to us for the attainment of the target  the first phase would need at least three years from the word  GO   It may take as long as five years  The preparation should consist of two sets of measures  of which one may be described as the creation of organisation and the other as the standardisation of teclmique  Both are equally important   they should proceed  side by side  59  What sort of organisation shall we need   It is dear that it must command the services of a sufficient number of workers  distributed over the whole country  in such a way that they will have friendly personal access to all mothers in the country  and effective opportunity to assist and advise them No such organisation exists at present  Nor can one be created  whose function is limited solely to the dissemination of birth control appliances and advice  This function must  therefore  be performed as a subsidiary activity of an organisation whose main function would embrace the whole field of maternity and child welfare  It is first of all necessary  therefore  that an adequate number of maternity and child welfare centres should be set up and they should be so sited as to establish practically complete coverage over all villages and towns  The centres should be developed as agencies which render practical help to mothers before  during  and after child birth  Before they begin to advise the avoidance of improvident maternity they should win friendship and trust by rendering service which seem to save life and promote health and strength among mothers and children  Does this mean then  that we are harking back to the view  dismissed a short while ago as a fallacy  that it is impossible to make any progress in limiting  ZI9  \fCHAPTER V   THE PROSPECT I981  births until we have completed our development programme in other respects   No  It is unnecessary to wait for the completion of the agricultural  indUstrial  ot  other economic development programmes  It is not even neceSsary to wait for the development of a full fledged National Health Service  But it is necessary to  isolate that part of our health programme which relates to the provision of mater   nity and child welfare services  give it top priority  along with  say  irrigation and ahead of all other development  and undertake accelerated development of these services to the point at which the needed organisation is created  60  How long will this take  Will it not be held up like many other health am i education schemes by lack of trained personnel  Obviously  the services of tra ned personnel will be needed  qualified midwives will be essential  But the problem would be a manageable one if care is taken to locate  and fully utilise  the services of all the  dais  who are to be found in all parts of the country   practising midwifery in its traditional form  It is possible  even probable  ihat  these  humble women hold the key to the solution of the population problem  They should be given simple training and instruction  advised and assisted by duly qualified midwives and helped to perform their useful services bener than they do at present  Those who render satisfactory service should be encouraged by payment of a modest bonus  to supplement their professional earnings  They should then be required  in return  to function in the villages as the agents of the maternity and child welfare centres  If this is done and the number of duly qualified midwives is increased rapidly and substantially  the staff requirements should be met  It is true that higher supervisory staff might be scarce for a long time  but the shortage can be largely made good by making the fullest use of the services of public spirited social workers  This is  in any case  necessary in order to develop the usefulness of the services as quickly as possible~ All social workers who are willing to help should be effectively organised  at the local level  the state level and the national level  and firmly linked with appropriate governmental agencies at all three levels  Given the necessary determination and drive  as well as the funds  the personnel needed for the work can be got together  at any rate over the greater part of the countrywithin five years     6i  This will complete one part and  no doubt  the more difficult part of the preparation which is necessary before a nation wide campaign for  reduction of improvident maternity can be launched  The second part is the one already visualised by the Planning Commission and provided  for in the current Five Year Plan  A Central Research and Information Unit should be set up  in  order to  carry out the various items of work described by the Planning Commissiori   m  \fIMPROVIDENT MATERNITY   REDUCTION TARGETS  In one sense  the activities of the Unit will have to be continued for an indefinite period  for there is scope for a great deal of research  But certain tasks should be laid down as required to be completed within a specified time   and Information Unit should be required to recommend a few acceptable  efficient  harmless and economic methods which are suitable for being sponsored by Government  It is perfectly obvious that no one contraceptive appliance is likely to fulfil all the criteria equally well  Therefore  harmlessness alone should be the decisive test   and cheapness the second most important consideration  One at least  among the recommended methods  should be based entirely on very cheap materials readily available in all parts of the country  even if the appliance is not entirely efficient or acceptable to all people    i  The Centra  Research   ii  This does not mean that methods of avoidance of undesired births other than those involving  the use of contraceptive appliances are to be ignored  On the contrary  they have an important part to play in achieving the national purpose  and it should be the duty of the Central Research and Information Unit to formulate correct ideas and guidance on the subject    a  The so called  rhythm method  has received considerable publicity  recently  There is much difference of opinion about a somewhat complicated version of this method  which is under investigation  There is also a simpler version  according to which people are merely advised to abstain from conjugal relations during the middle third of every menstrual cycle  It is not asserted that those who follow this simple rule of what may be called  conjugal temperance  can be certain that conception will be avoided thereby  It is freely conceded that the  safe period  is a misnomer and might not always be safe  But it is claimed that the observance of this simple rule is calculated  in many cases though not all  to reduce the chances of conception very substantially  If a large proportion of people living in a locality observe the rule  it would be reflected in a material diminution of the birth rate of that locality  Such a method will obviously be of no use to persons to whom certainty of avoidance of pregnancy is essential on grounds of health  It is also useless to persons who have had three or more children already  in the context of national policy envisaging the abolition of improvident maternity   But  if the claim is verified to be correct  it may be very useful for married couples to practise  conjugal temperanc~  during the first decade UI  \fCHAPTER V   THE PROSPEcT lgBr  or so of married life· before they have had three children  It should be the duty of the Central Research and Infonnation Unit to formulate clear guidance on this matter   b  Another non appliance method of contraception which requires consideration is  coitus interruptus   There is  at present  practical unanimity  of a somewhat disconcerting nature  about this subject among social workers engaged in the popUlarisation of birth control  They dismiss it with a brief reference to neurasthenia  Doubts about the wisdom of this attitude arise when one studies the report on an  investigation carried out by the Council of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists into family limitation and its influence on human fertility during the past five years   A few extracts will be found in ApPENDIX VII  The statistics collected during this investigation prove that  among a group of couples married in 1935 39  all of whom had practised some form of birth control between marriage and 1946  as many as 44 per cent had never employed any kind of appliance contraceptives   Forty four per cent is a very large proportion  and they do not seem to have done so badly  The finding is that  pregnancy rates during the practice of  non appliance   birth control were found to be about one fifth higher than under appliance methods   Other figures show that the proportion of people who successfully limit their families in this way used to be still higher in the past  The Commission finds that this is not due to ignorance of the existence of more effective methods or a mere prejudice against their usc   It must not be assumed   the Commis~ion reports   that in the present state of birth control technique tllere may not be a considerable number of people who positively prefer non· appliance methods   Now  it is impossible to believe that people would practise this method in such large numbers over a long time if it was invariably calculated to make them nervous wrecks  There are  no doubt  circumstances in which harmful results would follow  But equally clearly there must be circumstances in which they would not  otherwise the facts found by the Commission could not exist  There is  at present  a complete absence of serious information on the subject  It is necessary that correct information should be collected on this point  II is possible  to put il no higher It is made clear in the repOrt that  non appliance methods  are to all intcpts and purpOiCi synonym for coil U8  nteN u ptlM in the United Kingdom   222  \ftMPROVIDENt MATERNITY   REDUCTION TARGETS  that a large proportion of people who are unable or unwilling to us~ appliance methods of contraception for one reason or other  might yet succeed in avoiding improvident maternity by the practice of  conjugal temperance  until three children are born and  coitus interruptus  thereafter  If this possibility can be confirmed by the Central Research and Information Unit~ after careful study  the resulting social gain would be enormous   c  Apart from methods developed in foreign countries  it is possible that there are also some indigenous methods of a traditional nat uie  which are reasonably effective  There are references in old census reports to the belief that the tea garden coolies of Assam have long practised some effective method of contraception  This mayor may not be the case now  but an effort should be made to locate indigenous methods which may be locally well known but not generally talked about  Cd  There is a good deal of ignorance over the whole subject of conjugal relations  This is due  as the Royal Commission observes   to the furtive air that clings to the subject  Despite the efforts of organisations and individuals  through books and pamphlets and other educational means  to impart contraceptive knowledge in a healthy context  many persons still acquire the intormation only through dealers in pornography and from furtive talks   It should be the duty of the Central Research and Information Unit to cleanse the atmosphere and let in fresh air    iii  Apart from appliance methods and non appliance methods of contraception  there is the method of sterilisation  especially of the male  The technique is believed to be making good progress in recent years  The claim IS made that the minor operation invloved is safe  effective and free from any disabling effect both from the point of view of general health and the continuance of normal conjugal relations  If this is true and is brought home to the people  sterilisation of the male may become an imponant part of the methods by which improvident maternity is avoided  It is understood that the rapid expansion of facilities needed for meeting a rapidly growing demand will not present any formidable difficulty  Provision of authoritative guidance on this subject will be very valuable    ·Paragraph 61 deals with  f ol~nlary resort to IIterilisation by people wbo wish to avoid improvident m3to rLity  It has nothing to do with the proposal that people suffering from certain types of dJlCaael should be compulsarily stcrilil Cd  a very different matter   \fCHAP l d  V   rm PttoSPEct I98t  62  While these preparations regarding organisation and standardisation of methods are proceeding  those agencies which are already working in this field  mainly in cities  should be actively encouraged and assisted to develop their activities  Experience and information which become available thereby should be fully utilised by the Central Research and Information Unit  When the preparations are completed and the responsible authorities are satisfied that they are ready  the second phase should commence  A nation wide campaign should be launched for the elimination of improvident maternity from the life of the people  The campaign should be explained to the people in villages  as well as towns as a national movement designed to achieve a social reform indispensable for assuring the safety of the nation and promoting the welfare of its mothers and children  It will be essential for the success of this campaign that it should be launched and directed by a national organisation of women social workers  which should have actively helped earlier in the development of maternity and child welfare services  The educative campaign should receive political backing at the highest level  The elected representatives of the people who are members of Village Panchayats  Municipal Councils and District Boards should personally take active interest in the progress of the campaign in their areas  Once the mind of the people has been won  the rest will be easy  The recommended practices will spread  and the advice and facilities provided by the maternity and child welfare centres will be readily utilised  Progress achieved from year to year can be precisely measured by the statistics of registration of births and deaths  which will become complete and accurate as a result of the working of these services  The Central Government and Parliament  the State Government and the State Legislature  Municipal Councils  District Boards and Panchayats  all of them could review once every year at what rate the incidence of improvident maternity was actually following among the people commined to their charge  On the basis of such review they can take special steps to stimulate effort in areas which were lagging behind  If we set about the work in this way  we shall be able to secure  in about 15 yearsthat India has the lowest incidence of improvident maternity among all the countries of the world  Why should we imagine that something which is demonstrably good for mothers and children  and which the western peoples have adopted without any help or encouragement from the State  would be rejected by our people  even when they are helped and encouraged by the State   63· Obviously  all this will cost money  How much money will be needed   We cannot be sure about this  until we are nearing the end of the preparatory 224  \ftMPltOVIl llNT l tA tEttNtrv   REDTJCtION TARGEt   phase of the whole programme  But some idea  however tentative  is necessary at least in order to get a dimensional picture  The subject was discussed in this light by the present writer with Dr  T  LAKSHMINARAYANA  the Adviser of the Planning Commission on Health Programmes  A tentative estimate drawn up by him is included among the papers printed as ApPENDIX VII  His conclusion is that the expenditure chargeable to public funds will be approximately half a rupee per head of population  as the cost of providing maternity and child welfare services in the manner described  This will be the annual recurring expenditure required when the services are fully developed   the   expenditure will be smaller during the preparatory phase when the service  are being built up  For a poor country with a large and growing population  half a rupee per head is not a small sum  it is quite a lot of money  We have to face the fact  We must consider the problem on the basis that the growth of population cannot be checked unless there are maternity and child welfare services   and we cannot have such services unless we find the money for it  If the cost is fairly shared between the Central Government  the State Government and the local body concerned  it should not press unduly heavily on any of them  64  We may now hark back to paragraph 46  where the crucial question was formulated  If the effort to develop agricultural productivity with such rapidity as to overcome present shortages and keep pace with unchecked growth of population until 1981 is impracticable  is the effort to limit births and arrest the growth of population any less impracticable  The answer  it is now suggested  is in the affirmative  It would be idle  in any case  to maintain that there is any solution for our population land food problem which does not call for difficult  costly and sustained effort over an extended period of a type for which no precedent exists in history  We have already embarked on such effort  What we have now got to do is to take stock of the entire problem  and not merely the reflection of it over the limited period covered by one Five Y car Plan or two  We should take a long term decision envisaging the complete solution of the problem  If we find  on a long term view  that more than one course is open to us  we should choose the one which is less difficult  less costly and more likely to solve the problem permanently  The general tenor of the conclusion to which we are led by the analysis made in this chapter may be stated as below   The effort to overcome present shortages and keep pace with unchecked growth of population until 1981 involves the development of agricultural productivity by 380 lakhs of ANNUAL tons   \fCltAPtER V   rFtE PROSPECT I981  If the effort to develop agricultural productivity is combined with a simultaneous effort to reduce the incidence of improvident maternity to about five per cent  it will be sufficient to limit the development of agricultural productivity to 240 lakhs of ANNUAL tons  The former is unlikely to cost less than the latter or prove to be more practicable  The latter offers a permanent solution of the problem  while the former does not  The former opens up a prospect of indefinite duration of hard labour without immediate results  The latter will be rewarded by visible reduction of human suffering and promotion of human happiness while the effort is still proceeding  The choice is clear   D   Conclusion WE HA VB COME to the end of our attempt to project our mind some way into the future and visualise the prospect for 198 I  We have seen clearly the drift of the current on which we have been moving since 1921 and whither it was taking us  We have taken note of the efforts now being made to steer the ship of State in an altogether different direction and studied the chart of this new course  the First Five Year Plan  Let us summarise the broad conclusion   Firsl   If we can be sure that food will be available to the people during the next thirty years  at least as well as it has been during the last thirty years  and if no popular movement in favour of limiting births develops  as it has done among Western peoples   then the further course ofpopulation growth may be foreseen with confidence  Our number will grow from about 36 crores in 1951  to about 41 crores in 1961  46 crores in 1971 and 52 crores in 1981  The growth will  indeed  be somewhat more rapid as   in the conditions assumed  the expectation of life will continue to increase   Secondly   The likelihood of the last figures being actually reached is   however  small  The governing assumption  continued availability of food supply at undiminished mtes of consumption along with unchecked growth of population  is unlikely to hold good for as long as thirty years  1~6  \fCONCLUSION  This conclusion is reached after taking full account of the tachooIoaical possibilities of development of agricultural productivity   Thirdly   The experience of I943 gives warning of the possibility that growing food shortage might lead to a breakdown of the distribution of food supply and thus open the way to a rcturn of those  natural  checks to population growth which were in operation during the thirty years preceding   92 I   This possibility  however  is unlikely to be permitted to materialise  The system of planned  state trading  in foodgrains  developed during the last decade  is now well established  So long as we hold fast to it  there is a guarantee that food shortage will be kept under control and prevented from developing into a breakdown of food supply  Sufficient time will  therefore  be available for wise planning and efficient execution of measures designed to overcome food shortage permanently   Fourthly   It is possible to overcome food shortage permanently  by taking suitable measures over an extended period of about fifteen years  For this purpose  development of agricultural productivity on an even larger scale than that undertaken in the First Five Year Plan will be necessary  but it will not be sufficient  Effective steps should be taken concurrently to limit births to approximate parity with deaths and thereby achieve a substantially stationary population  Fz rhl v   Births will get limited to approximate parity with deaths  if what has been described as  improvident maternity  is avoided by all or most married couples    Improvident maternity  consists of all births occurring to mothers who have already had three or more children  when at least one of them is alive    Sixlhly   A combined approach to the solution of our problem calls for the following targets    i  Increase of agricultural productivity from the present level of approximately 700 lakhs of ANNUAL tons to about 940 lakhs of ANNUAL tons   ii  Reduction of improvident maternity from over 40 per cent  its incidence at present  to under 5 per cent  If these two targets are accorded equal  priority and ranked higher than all other development targets  they can be attained before population increases beyond 45 crores  our total number will then become substantially statioI lary round about 45 crores  and  \fCHAPTER V   THE PROSPECT IgBl  Sevemhly    The attainment of the target of reduction of improvident maternity will necessitate the prior creation and permanent maintenance of a nation wide organisation of maternity and child welfare services  This is difficult  but feasible and essential  66  This report began with a citation from the CoNSTITUTION OF INDIA  It is appropriate that it should end with another  The CoNSTITIJTION enjoins that the  State shall regard
