      "I'll try to keep this short. I had a [1967 Impala 4 door](https://i.imgur.com/HLBPpTF.jpg) that I bought in Feb 2019. A couple months ago I bought my first house that had a 2.5 car garage. I moved the car in and started tearing it down for a complete restoration. I had the body in one bay and the chassis in another, plus the whole garage filled with parts. About two months ago my girlfriend came to live with me during this whole crisis and the whole time has hated that car. She wants to park in the garage but I have 2 acres of land with a lot of nice places to park under shady trees or hell even in the barn if it has to be inside. I tell her tough luck its my house and its not like I can just throw it back together real quick. Anyways I was out of town for a couple days on a business trip for the small local company I work for. When I got back, my girlfriend was all smiles. Making me food all the time, doing all the chores, all that. I though maybe she just was happy to have me home but then I realized that I didn't see her car in it's usual spot. I asked her where she parked so I could make sure I mow that area and keep it clean and she said not to worry because she parked in the garage. I asked how and she told me to go check it out. Turns out that while I was gone she hired some people to come over and move everything related to that car, including the drivetrain, body, and chassis and all parts, and take it to the local dump/scrapyard. I was absolutely dumbfounded. I had spent over 11k on that car including new parts, services, and the car itself. I told her that I was going to be taking her to court for that and she brushed me off like I was being dramatic. I told her that its done between us and to pack her things and leave. I admit I was a really angry but I did end up getting a lawyer, and as I have all the receipts for all that money spent and I have her on my house's security cam footage letting the guys in and watching them take it all I think I can win. Her family and friends are absolutely blowing me up saying its just a stupid old piece of junk and that she cannot pay back all that money I spent, and that I should just let it go. But I have been putting all my time, effort, and money into that car for a year and a half now and goddammit if I am not going to get justice for what she did. AITA\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: Thank you all so much for the support and awards and everything. I'm glad I have some people on my side. I got a call from her mom about 20 minutes ago and she told me that i was ruining her daughter's life over a stupid car. I told her she ruined her own life. I've been gathering documentation and stuff and I'm about to head down to the police station and file a report, as suggested by lots here. Once again thank you all\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE : went to the police station last night, was told to come back in the morning. just got back and filed an official report against her for grand larceny and grand theft auto. i showed them all the receipts i had for the car and the footage of her letting the guys come and take it as well as the title for the vehicle in my name. they said they will be in contact with all 3 parties (me, ex gf, and junkyard guys) soon and they will hopefully be able to recover some or all of the car. just have to wait now\n",
      "\n",
      "HUGE UPDATE : THEY FOUND MY GODDAMN CAR!! the junkyard guys apparently were in the middle of hiding it when the police came to ask them questions. it was on a forklift and they were gonna put it on top of a pile of cars that was hidden behind more piles of cars. they said it was theirs and they had the title, but obviously didnt have the title for it and since they matched the vin on the chassis and body to the vin on my title, it was obviously mine. I know at least one person there has been arrested, i think he was in the camera footage i talked about earlier but idk if it was the boss or whomever or even his specific charge, they also told me they would be looking into this specific junkyard for any other vehicles reported stolen. they said they haven't been able to get in contact with my ex just yet but they're working on it. im just so glad they found my car. luckily i made quite an album of pictures detailing me tearing down the car and so i can use that to prove what parts they had were mine so i can hopefully get most or all of it back. police haven't let me take it back home yet as they say it is evidence or something so hopefully i can get it back eventually. thank you all so much for the support and advice! SHES GONNA BE ALRIGHT\n",
      "Note. My step-daughter, Madeline, was about a year old when I married her mother, Jessica. Madeline’s father died before she was born. \n",
      " \n",
      "Madeline is currently 15, and she’s rebelling for almost everything. She did something bad, so while picking her up, I set a punishment up for her. Then she said “You’re not my dad. I don’t have to follow you”. Honestly, I got a bit hurt from that. But I understand that she didn’t mean it, and that she’d probably change. I just replied “I’m still your legal guardian for the next 3 years, and as long as your in my house, you have to follow my rules.” \n",
      " \n",
      "That happened about 2 days ago. So our family was going grocery shopping, when Madeline said “I’m hungry. I need food.” I decide to be extremely cheeky and say “Hi Hungry, I’m not your dad.” My son just started to laugh uncontrollably. My daughter was just quiet with embarrassment. And my wife was berating me “Not to stoop down to her level.” \n",

I’m really sorry that I hurt you by the words I said. And I am really your dad. I changed your diapers, I met your boyfriend, and I plan on helping you through college. And plus I’m legally your dad, so we’re stuck together. But seriously, I’m going to love you like my daughter even if you don’t think I’m your dad. Then I hugged her. She did start to cry. I assume that’s good.\n",
      "Hello, everyone. First of all, thank you all for the kind words, support and love that everyone has offered and given. These weeks have been the most difficult I have ever experienced and it is with great sadness that I tell you all that my beautiful and cat crazy wife, has passed. I've had to cut this short due to character limits, sorry all. But, she did leave all of you a note, Reddit. I've copied everything verbatim below. She truly loved everyone and was smiling so much after her first post. I'll take my leave here. Much love.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Reddit! If you're reading this, I am dead. Pretty crazy to be talking to a dead person, eh? It feels a bit strange to be writing this. If this feels a bit disconnected, I'm sorry. I have to take frequent breaks as I get tired pretty quickly now. My husband offered to write these words (such a sweet ham, I know. Be nice to him, okay?). But, I wanted my last words to be written by me. Long story short, we talked to my parents. A lot of people asked about why my husband wasn't planning the funeral and my parents were taking control. Honestly, my parents didn't take the news of my passing to come well and I suppose their closure(?) was to try and take control of what they could. I'm not angry at them for it, I understand. They had already pre-paid a large portion of the service and to put it plain and simple, it was a shit hand they were dealt. So, we talked to them. I laid it all out for them and somehow, we reached a compromise. Lots of tears. Lots of hugs. And surprisingly, lots of laughs. They admitted that they had been losing their faith with everything that had happened and their way to attempt to find it again was to take control and \"guide me\" into the afterlife. Not my thing though and I explained that I am not them, but their daughter who wanted to live her last weeks in peace, not the turmoil they were putting me through. And while a lot of people stated that funerals are for the living (true true), I firmly believe that a funeral is for the living to remember that person as WHO they were, not what anyone else wanted them to be. My parents seemed to understand when I told them that. They were not on board with the party favor aspect though, kind of a bummer. Pretty lucky to plan my own funeral, honestly. But, now that that is all said and done! Thank you, guys. I was blown away by the responses.I was moved to tears and I wish I had had the chance to meet every single one of you. You all be good now, ight? Take it one day at a time and fucking enjoy yourself! You only get one life, unless you're someone who has survived death than you're just a fucking hero and probably a cat with a few lives to spare. I love you all. I'm resting easy now. This disease sucks and I'm happy to be rid of it. And laugh and love and cry and be sad. Shit happens. I've got to go now, I'm gonna go snuggle my husband and my cats. Keep it real, Reddit. Love you, all!\"\n",
      "I'm back like I said I would be,. My [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/awyi8k/aita_for_despising_my_mentally_handicap_sister/) got a lot of attention and seeing as you guys seem interested, here's my update.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, since that day I made the post i've been staying with my grandfather. The week's been honestly a huge change for me for better and for worse but i'll try to run it down.\n",
      "\n",
      "I started by telling my grandpa the story of why I broke down the way I did and to be honest, he seemed horrified. No one in my family knew my parents were using me as essentially a free care service for my sister. My grandpa told me some things that I don't feel comfortable repeating here but in essence my sister is \"supposed\" to be getting care from a professional and that my parents were ignoring that, along with this I was not supposed to be caring for her at all with her mental state as apparently she is a danger to herself and others. With everything else I told him, along with stuff like the movie indecent he was really mad and told me to not contact my parents without him there. He pretty much told me that he would be meeting with my parents beforehand and that he was going to be there when I sat down with them. It didn't end here either, the rest of the week consisted of other family checking in on me and telling me things my parents hid from me. This included the fact that my parents have been taking money from family to fund a \"caretaker\" that doesn't exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suffice to say, this week has been rough. But, the upside is that even through all this, my extended family has been giving me more love than i've felt in a while. My grandfather spent this last week \"making up for the time i've lost.\" Encouraging me to spend time with friends and do things I want to do. My aunts and uncles have also been helping me through the week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, Saturday night I sat down with parents to talk. It went badly to say the least. They came clean to me about everything. They told me things I will not repeat here. But they did not apologize. My parents still claim that I some how owed my sister my time. My father even saying \"You were put here to be her caretaker\". I won't lie and say I was composed. After everything i learned I confronted them. On the fact that my sister needed a caretaker. The money my dad was taking from his sister, and a few other things. They denied it or made excuses. And in the end, we ended off in a worse place than before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today will be my last time talking to them for a while. After talking with my grandfather and uncle last night, I'm not going back. Later today i'm going there and picking up my stuff and moving in with my grandfather. When I graduate high school i'm planning on leaving the state to go to school. My aunt has told me that the money she was sending my dad will be instead be coming to me from now on. My parents have called me twice since Saturday, neither of them were to apologize and only ask when I was coming home.\n",
      "\n",
      "I won't be going back to them. Right now I still feel pretty uneasy about everything but I feel like that will pass. The rest of my family is showing their support to me and honestly, it feel great. But in the end I lost my parents. Over all of this, i've learned something that I wished I saw earlier. I don't hat my sister. In fact I love her with all my heart. I should never have never projected my hate onto her. That was wrong, and someday I hope to make up for it. But for now I need to leave.\n",

I have my birth certificate, social security card, and every other document and record I could think of. My parents were quiet the whole time I was there. Shorty after I arrived my dad left with my sister and my mom only hovered over us silently as me moved. It took a while but as we left she broke down and told me she loved me and would miss me. I hugged her and said goodbye, and that was it. Even now I sit here and think if she really meant it. After this whole week of her not saying anything she waited till the end. I hope she meant it. Right now though, I think I just need to look ahead. Maybe one day me and my parents can reconnect. I hope so.\n",

I told her that I was going to have to miss the wedding because I was going to see the world cup final in person, she obviously got mad but her new husband said that he hasn't seen anything wrong with it because he knew how badly I wanted to go. I went to her first wedding with her first husband so, I didn't see anything wrong with what I did or the decision I made. I end up having a great time at the world cup final and I kind of don't regret anything. AITAH?\n",

      "Post Title:  AITA for being mad at my parents for ruining another birthday? (TW- MENTIONS OF SELF HARM)\n",
      "content:  I 13f am the youngest child in the house and I always am overlooked or neglected or not taken seriously. I'm uploading this here because I want to know if I am being a brat or not. Over the past few years my birthday has been constantly ruined. For example, on my 11th birthday my mom and dad had a huge fight over something stupid which led to a very awkward day. I had cried alot that day.  On my 12th birthday I just wanted a simple cake because I knew that if I ask for more I'd be labelled as a brat or spoilt ungrateful kid, my father got the cake flavour different then what I had asked for because of my mom's inlaws and my cousins. I couldn't eat that flavour because usually chocolate cakes are made out of dark chocolate which is extremely bitter to me. My mother replaced it a few days afterwards being very annoyed with me. This year I decided that I wanted a party for myself, I wanted to have the party a day before rather than on my birthday since I value my family and I'd like to spend time with them as well, my mother and father were deciding where and what should my party be like when I had already decided that I'd like me and my friends go out for a movie and after that a cafe. My mother was getting annoyed once again so I said it's okay and I'll settle for a cake again, and messaged my friends because I didn't want another fight to break out in the house. My mother got mad that I instantly messaged my friends about and she said that they would've made the arrangements when I very well know it wasn't gonna be the way I wanted it and I would be upset at the end, my mother did shout at me for that and I did cry alot, fast forward to the day of my birthday, the first thing my mother said was \"get off the phone before I kill you.\" I had to remind her that it was my birthday and then she wished me. In the morning my mother gave me a gift and said that it had costed alot when I very well knew that she got scammed because half of the products were damaged. She shot me an ungrateful look and ignored me the rest of the day which made me feel a bit sad and cause me to get my blade and cut myself. ( Idk what it is but I find relief in cutting myself and thinking about suicide just feels good). After that me and my family went out at a hotel for eating dinner, my sister was constantly on her phone, so was my mother. My father was watching the Cricket World Cup and I felt really alone. That was how my birthday went, and to gift myself something I asked if I could get a Polaroid camera, for which I have been saving up for and I have enough money. I am paying it from what I have saved and my mother is still refusing it. Overall I'd say I had a bad birthday because whenever it is my sister's birthday, everything is perfect, no fights, no messing up in cake flavours, the whole family is United, etc. also the cake which I had gotten, I only got a slice of it because my dad thought about giving it to my cousins and the inlaws again. The cake was small as it is and my sister and father ate the rest of it and I got little to nothing. I just wonder why do they give one of their kids a perfect birthday and the other one a painful birthday.\n",

      "Post Title:  AITA for telling my husband his job as a stay at home dad is only easy because I help out?\n",
      "content:  I tried to post it on other subreddits but they keep removing it because my account is new. I am writing this from the guest bedroom because my husband and I had a fight. So, the thing is my husband is a stay at home dad. 3 years ago he wanted to quit his job and take care of the house and children (6f and 2m). I work a decent job and earn most of the money. My husband takes pride in being a SAHD. He always brags about how it is the easiest job in this world and women are just complaining for no reason. But the truth is I help him with the chores as much as I can. In the morning I wake up and fix the breakfast for them, my husband gets our daughter ready for school. I also do meal preps for lunch. All he has to do is assemble them and cook it. I pack my and my daughter's lunch. When I am at work, he does the cleaning and spends time with our son or does his thing. Later when I come home, I cook the dinner and give my son a bath, help my daughter with her school work or I play with them for sometime until bed time. Besides that, whenever we do laundry I fold the clothes that he washes and put them away. And during deep cleaning of our house we split the tasks 50-50. I also handle all the doctors appointment.\n",

      "This system works really well but  I hate that he thinks my contribution is not enough. That he does all the chores and I do not even lift a finger. Moreover, he has a blog and tiktok where he films his days. He also makes posts about how easy it is to be a SAHD and women just complain and full of it. It is the easiest job in this world. I am glad he likes it but I hate he thinks he is superior to everyone and invalidating their experience. I grew up in a house where my dad didn't even lift a finger and my mom did literally everything around the house. He was the \"fun\" dad doing bare minimum. So, I do not want that to happen to my husband. Also it is my house too, I believe if both people do chores the stress becomes less. Also, I know many of my friends who struggle with doing chores as a SAHM. I also know women who work and still do majority of the chores. And his comments makes me irritated.\n",
      "\n",
      "SO, yesterday my friend Ashley came to visit. She is a mother of two. Her son probably has ADHD and very much active, she has trouble handling her son and gets no help from her husband. Her son breaks a cup in our house. Ashley was saying sorry. My husband cleaned it up and she was complaining how exhausted she is. My husband scoffed and told her \"You must be doing the parent thing wrong because I am a stay at home parent too but I never had problem. My wife barely does anything around the house and it is so easy. Maybe I should give you a lesson or two.\" I can see Ashley was upset. I understand why. Later that day I told him what he said to Ashley was very rude. My husband acted as if he said nothing wrong and was honest. I pointed that he doesn't do all the chores. I help him with at least 40%. That's why he thinks it is easy. He again argued that those chores are not significant compared to what he does. I told him he is being mean to everyone. We got lucky that our kids are easy and not active. Most of the kids are hard to handle. He again scoffed and said how hard can it be.\n",

I was home and did 99% of the childcare and house management, in addition to handling the finances. My husband drives for UPS, so aside from the weekends he didn't do a ton to help - not because he didn't want to, but because he really couldn't. He was typically gone 8a-8p M-F and even later during peak/holiday season. But he would help when he could, like folding and putting away laundry, doing the dishes after dinner and since he was usually a much better cleaner (in his opinion) he would clean the whole house once a week, lol.

Anyway, you should never throw stones at other people’s houses, he has no idea what’s going on in their lives. Maybe he sucks at keeping the home in order? Done properly it’s a huge pia. Why is he not doing his stuff plus half the things you are? It sounds like he is quite free. If that suits you as a family, rock on, but he probably isn’t that busy vacuuming and dusting and food shopping and making all the meals, etc. that’s not easy, it’s tedious and time consuming.

He can give his lessons on how to do parenting better as a stay at home parent if he does it alone like Ashley and others do without any help from their spouse. Say a month but hopefully you won’t need a month to get the point across once you stop helping him. \\n\\nFor a week you should drop the rope and let him be a sahp like most other mums where the partner only provides financially. He says the things you do are not important and not significant to the running of the household and kids so give him the full reigns to run the home as he sees fit without your input or help… let him do the bath time/bedtime routine everyday alone, give him the childrens diary and make him responsible for any appointments and schooling scheduling needs the kids have, let him do the meal preps, make dinner and lunches (including yours just like other SAHPs) if he doesn’t do yours buy lunch and save the receipts, if he orders in lunch or dinner  that week get the receipts. \\n\\nTake overtime at work that week or go gym, get a drink or meet with friends after work that week so you come home later. Apart from playing with the kids be the SAHP most dads are just for that week.\\n\\nAt the end of week on Sunday have a meeting with him once the kids are in bed to review how that week worked for you both. Use receipts as proof of help needed if you had to buy lunch or dinner two things you help with or do completely.\\n\\nHe’s not appreciating your contributions or respecting what you do in the home to make both of your life’s easier and better for your children. Maybe after the week he will appreciate you if not go onto week two and add a night out with your friends on Saturday.\\n\\nBecause he has created a social media presence to highlight himself as a SAHD and publicly set himself up as the perfect SAHP offering his opinions and advice he has to be challenged. He’s based his SM  and views off his highly inflated ego and lying that he does everything alone regarding the household chores and children yet he hasn’t taken on the majority of the mental loads regarding the children appointments… him saying it’s easy and others are doing things wrong and woman are using their gender and lying about how hard it is if they find any part of parenting difficult is not only wrong but mentally damaging for other parents both male and female that are doing most of the work alone or dealing with child that has special needs and need more support. \\n\\nLike you said Relationships needs two people putting in the work to make it successful, it also needs respect and consideration of each other’s needs and feelings. It seems like it’s expected or you and taken for granted but there very little consideration regarding you and little to no respect for what you do. He’s being very careless with you. It can’t only be you putting in the effort to be mindful of caring about his emotional and mental well-being.\\n\\nI hope he figures things out and stops taking you for granted and overcompensating for his insecurities in being a SAHD and taking his issues regarding that out on others by belittling them and the your daily input at home. It should not take making others feel small or bad about themselves and their parenting for him to feel good about himself.

When she started dating her boyfriend she slowly stopped talking to everyone but promised me from June to the day before my birthday she would be there.\n",

      "\n",
      "It wasn’t too shocking from Riley. Riley had a strong history of doing stuff like this since middle school but Nora always would tell me how she hates people who would ghost people. So how could she do that to me? She knew how hard I worked on everything. It’s not that hard to text “Hey sorry I can’t come.” I would be sad but being ghosted/ignored while you post about where you are when you said you’d be here?  Watching my socials WHILE ignoring me? Nah that’s gonna piss me off.\n",

      "Post Title:  AITAH or telling my mom and aunt they can't be at the hospital for the birth of our daughter over a cake recipe?\n",
      "content:  \n",
      "My (40m) very pregnant wife (36f) is one of the purest women I know.  She doesn’t have a mean, or malicious bone in her body.  My mother and my aunt are second first generation Americans as my grandmother and Grandfather met in a concentration camp during WWII and were liberated and came to America. Because of this, they have developed a close bond. Both my maternal grandparents have long been deceased. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now down to the story. My wife bakes on the side, and my family asks her to bake for them all the time, they pay her, and they get their baked goods.  Mom and Aunt have asked my wife to re-create my grandma’s carrot cake recipe on many occasions.  My wife has done this, down to perfect detail, and even my mom and aunt have said it might be better than my grandma’s.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Now down to what caused me to blow up. My aunt was having a birthday party at her work and asked my wife to bake 2 dozen cupcakes. After the party, my aunt said, “They were a hit, and probably your best batch yet!  But did you change something in the recipe? They were lighter, and even more moist than the last couple times you have made them for us.”  My wife responded, “Nope. Followed the recipe on my fridge as I always do.”  Aunt – “No.  I know my mom’s cupcakes, and you have made them perfectly before.  This time you had to have used a different recipe, or ingredient. Did you use cake flour this time?”  Wife – “No.  This is even the same bag of flour I used the last time.” Aunt – “No.  I know you did something this time. I know my mom’s recipe, and this is not her recipe.” \n",
      "\n",
      "I told my wife to drop it, as it was going nowhere, and was starting to irritate her. My mom texted us later, “What did you do to the cupcakes? We want to know so that the next time we make them, we know what to do to make them taste just as good.” My wife responded with everything she had said before.  I told my mother to drop it, that she just read the recipe and went with it, as she always does. \n",
      "\n",
      "A few days later, I caught my wife staring at the recipe on the fridge reading the recipe and asking out loud what she possibly could have done different this last go around.  I could see she was upset, so I messaged my mom and aunt that they needed to apologize to her, because they ultimately were calling my wife a liar. My mom, “We didn’t say those words. That’s rude and upsetting you would think we’re calling her a liar. Apologize to us.” during this back and forth, my wife had made the comment to me that she would be okay if they weren't at the hospital during the birth. \n",
      "\n",
      "After a little bit of back and forth of me being (what I feel) gaslighted, by them saying they are not calling my wife a liar, I said, “Well. Until you can apologize to her for calling her a liar, don’t visit the hospital when she gives birth. We are not telling you the day we’re going in for delivery until you do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This has set a chain of events off in my family.  My sisters agree with me, but my Mom, Aunt, and their friends have reached out saying I crossed a line. Even my wife has said that’s a little extreme.  But when she's asked to talk to me about it, she says she respects the decision. \n",
      "\n",
      "So Reddit, AITAH? I keep being told it’s petty to have this much of a blowup over a cupcake recipe, but I feel that it’s disrespectful to my wife. she says she’s not \"that\" upset, but as I said above, I catch her reading the recipe on the fridge and talking to herself about it throughout the days. I don’t want my mom and aunts behaviors to continue through to our daughter, and I fear that they may do something similar to her down the line. This is how they’ve always been.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: hey Reddit. With all due respect. I appreciate the comments, but I know my wife better than anyone commenting. The comments of, \"making the decision without consulting her\" are baseless. While we didn't have that exact conversation, and she didn't ask my family to not be there, I know what she was thinking because we communicate. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's like, how you don't ask someone to marry you unless you know the answer is yes, think along the same lines. \n",
      "\n",
      "My wife has also since then, told me she was ok with uninviting them from going to the hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit 2: I'm getting a surprisingly high number of requests for the recipe. I asked the wife if I could share it. She said, \"Quit gossiping. Take a picture of the recipe. Apologize for misspellings as I had pregnancy brain, and please let them know that I add a tsp of vanilla extract to the cake batter as well. Oh, and let them know that they can use any combination of carrots. 2 cups baby food, 2 cups shredded baby carrots, or one of each.\"\n",

I'm going to apologize to my mother and tell her that she just needs to respect my wife a little more, and while she may not feel she did wrong, my wife took it a certain way, and that you can't help how people feel. I agree that she's the innocent one in all this, and I appreciate all the positive words directed her way, even if there were not so kind words directed mine, I get it. \n",

      "One more edit. Today was crazy. Wife approached me and thanked me because she was trying to find a way to approach the subject about wanting her privacy at the hospital. She said that, while this chain of events didn't go the way as planned, it ended with the result she wanted. She had thought maybe I wanted them there at the hospital, and was waiting for the right time to talk to me. But really. Who would want this family there...  family had been told that decision is final. Brother in law accused me of, \"in 6k years of family bond, I am the one to break that tradition\". \n",

      "Post Title:  AITAH for being mad at autistic step daughter for not helping in any way with family chores?\n",
      "content:  First of all let me point out that I love my whole family and my step daughter (14) and step son (13) are a part of this family just as much as my biological daughter. My girlfriend (41) has since then gotten our own daughter(1) together and she is a little beacon of happiness shining and brightening everyones day - most of the time. I know that getting a newborn into the family has taken a lot out of me and my girlfriend's time that can no longer be used on the big kids, and we have solved this in the best way we possibly can by splitting us up. One does something with the big kids while the other one gets to be with our youngest daughter. \n",
      "\n",
      "Last year our oldest got diagnosed with autism - mind you that we have known this for a long time. She is incredibly booksmart, but lacks severely in social interaction skills. Her mind just works in a different way than ours, and that's totally okay. When her way of viewing the world doesn't fit how the world actually works she can have a bit of a melt down, and now that she is in her teenage years things have gotten quite hard for her. Finding oneself in that age is hard enough as it is, but with a diagnosis of autism on top of that, it must be extremely tough. While she is extremely booksmart she has a pretty high learning curve, and is not self sufficient in any way. Not because she couldn't but because she has her head in the clouds as one might say. Her mind is going 200MP/H thinking of something else than whatever she is told to do. This makes it frustrating for everyone as she forgets what she is doing, and is extremely slow in doing the things she is told. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now the problem has started recently with me starting full time work. I don’t have the same time to clean the house as I did before, and both my girlfriend and I are working full time and when we get home we are caring for a small child while we need to clean up the house, and prepare meals. Me and my girlfriend agree that it should and will never be the teenager's issue that we decide to get another child, that is for me and my girlfriend to bear.\n",
      "\n",
      "When all of this is said the problem is cleaning up after oneself and helping when it is needed. Not because I tell you too, but because you're a part of this household. An example could be my step daughter making a cup of hot chocolate. She grabs a cup, pour in the milk, adds cocoa powder, puts it in the microwave, takes the cup and leaves for her room. Now this sounds fine, but the only steps in this process that doesn't make a mess that I have to clean up is literally finding the cup and milk. When she adds the cocoa powder she spills the powder. When she stirs the chocolate drink she spills on the countertable. When she puts it in the microwave she spills on the way over there because she fills it to the brim. When she microwaves it spills inside because it's filled to the brim and boils over. Then she takes it to the room and I'm left with the cleaning, sometimes even putting the milk back in the fridge.\n",
      "\n",
      "So. As one might figure out from my description above this annoys me. When you confront her with the typical you forget to clean up after yourself, she either freaks out or just flat out ignores you. She doesn't even move her head away from her screen. No matter the time and space you try to talk with her she gets mad, and I'm losing my patience with her. I know that she is in her teens and that is part of the explanation, but our step son moans and kicks, but he does it - she doesn't.  \n",
      "I feel like an asshole because she has autism and has a lot on her plate, but it’s starting to feel like she just ignores you on purpose because she knows she can get away with it and manipulates you this way. Because sometimes she can do everything, and behaves like a completely normal teen. She bakes cookies for her friends and cleans up after herself and we come home to a house that looks exactly like we left it. So you're left with a feeling that you know she can clean up after herself but chooses not to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now before I got shot down for her autism. We have been in constant dialog with psychologists and read countless books. We love our daughter and we want the best for her - but it’s hard sometimes. I know sometimes she is just done for the day and her battery is used for the day, but there is indication for when that happens.\n",

Is there any way you can help her “loop” it into the task? Clean up while the hot chocolate is microwaving, or something is cooking, etc. She might be also reacting negatively to being interrupted in the middle of different tasks more than the reminder to clean itself.

It is vital that people, especially those with disabilities, learn how to become and remain independent. If she is capable of cleaning, then she should be expected to do so.

      "\n",
      "I was raised by hippy parents I guess and I think that really rubbed off on my when I was then dating. So I had a very \"free love\" attitude to dating and sex. I slept around a bit, had a few one night stands. Was involved in polyarmorous and open relation ships.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I've described myself as \"aggressively pansexual\" in my idea of a perfect world, having sex would be as socially acceptable as hand shakes. I'd happily have sex with pretty much anyone I'd know.\n",
      "\n",
      "BUT I know this isn't the norm. I'm well adjusted socially and I have a high degree of empathy (I think) and I understand that most people aren't like that. So I am happy being platonic friends with people. And even if I'm very sexually attracted to someone, if they're not interested in me like that I'm still happy to be friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then in 2015 I met my now wife. She wasn't like that. She was purely monogomous and felt that sex was very personal and intimate. We met each other through friends of friends and we vibed really well and enjoyed hanging out with each other, and then when we were chilling at her house one day watching an Avengers movie, and her housemate had to leave and it was just us on the couch, one thing lead to another and we slept together.\n",
      "\n",
      "After talking about where we were at we decided to stay as friends, but we just liked hanging out with each other too much and then it happened again. And we had another talk but I really liked her and I figured if I could do monogomy with anyone, it would be her. So I made the decision. Monogamy it was. And, well. We grew together and apart from the odd, you know, craving for diversity I was super happy, and I feel like I was falling in love, so I proposed because I realised that I would choose spending the rest of my life with her over polyamory.\n",

      "\n",
      "She got back the next day and she was acting a bit, I dunno, noticeably a bit reserved and withdrawn. Figured she might've been hung over, made her a cup of tea and asked if she needed anything, she shook her head and said that she just wanted some alone time. I thought something might have happened and said \"Ok, I'll be here if you need to talk.\" She didn't look at me and I was really worried that something awful might have happened.\n",

      "On the monday she went to work (I work from home) without a word and came home and was still not talking to me, that was when I started putting my foot down.

Please, this isn't like you to shut me out.\" And that's when she burst into tears and told me that they went clubbing and she met some younger guy who was really hot and they danced for a while and she got really drunk and she ended up going back to his place and having sex.\n",

She took something that might make her end her relationship if it happened to her and she did it to you.', 'NTA.\\n\\nI had a similar issue with an ex-girlfriend.

She also doesn\\'t seem as upset that she broke HER most sacred vow, she\\'s upset with YOU that YOU aren\\'t upset at her. You may want to wait until she has calmed down some and sit down with her to talk. Ask her straight up \"If I had cheated, what would you do? If you would kick me out and demand divorce then I\\'m expecting you will leave now and sign the papers when I send them. If you would be willing to work things out we can start from there\". \\n\\nIf she is so invested in you two only having sex with each other that nothing else matters then she won\\'t let this go. She won\\'t be able to move past it.', 'I think you’re missing an important part. You might not value monogamy as much, but she does. And she totally disregarded that to sleep around. Obviously NTA, but I don’t think you’re looking at this right. She’s done something really bad, from her POV, and you shouldn’t be so relaxed about it.', 'What I love about OP is that I have heard multiple guys say the have this attitude towards sex and they want open relationships etc. But when their partner has sex with other guys they get offended. OP kudos for being honest with your feelings. Of course NTA. And it is really fortunate that you can move past this. She kind of sounds like an asshole though. Because if monogamy is such a big deal for her, why did she betray your trust? I don’t understand what she wished to happen? She should consider herself lucky. Most people wouldn’t tolerate what OP seems to be ok with', 'NTA\\n\\nShe seems upset to find out that you have the exact attitude to sex you always claimed to have. I am assuming you were always upfront about that with her.\\n\\nMy first instinct was to have a little empathy for her realisation you don\\'t view sex as important and personal as she does, and that I could see why she would then be thinking \"the reason he doesn\\'t care that I\\'ve slept with someone else is because he never saw our sexual relationship as personal and special, and he\\'s also slept with other people since we started dating\". \\n\\nBut then I realised, your perspective isn\\'t a secret. It would be like a vegetarian getting upset that their partner they knew full well eats meat, wasn\\'t upset that the vegetarian slipped up and ate meat.\\n\\nI would say if you did want to keep this relationship, you could approach this from the angle that you know from her perspective that she betrayed you and risked your entire relationship, and it hurts that she did that. For example if I knew someone I loved believed in curses, I would be upset they put a curse on me even though I know curses aren\\'t real and nothing will happen.

Assuming you want to try to save your relationship, you need to tell her why you still love her and want to stay with her, because she cannot understand why you don't care -- it's incompatible with her view of what romantic love is and it doesn't seem like you made an active effort to help her understand. \\n\\nI also wonder why you aren't annoyed at all.

She could’ve chosen to not cheat. But she did. And instead of looking inwards, she’s blamed you for not caring and the alcohol for her own lack of control. This is what you need to address. It’s wonderful that you’re being a supportive husband, but that doesn’t mean you get yourself steamrolled. You just need to look at similar stories and see what happens in the future.

Even though you have told her with your **actions** over the last 8 years that you have made monogamy an important part of your life with her, what you just told her with your **words** right now was \"I don\\'t give a shit about monogamy.\" She was attempting to confess a serious breach of her own personal ethics to you and you treated it like it was nothing. Do you have any idea how jarring that had to be for her? Right now it doesn\\'t matter how YOU feel about monogamy, the point of this confession was how SHE feels about monogamy, and you blew it off. Any sane person would assume that you are fine with yourself cheating as well at this point, for starters.\\n\\nSecondly if someone comes to you and is very very upset about a thing they did that you don\\'t personally consider a big deal, the proper response isn\\'t \"who cares,\" it\\'s \"I see, we should talk about this.\"\\n\\n>She claims that I have never cared about our relationship\\n\\nYou see how your response led her directly to that conclusion, right? \\n\\n>She says I\\'m an asshole for not caring.\\n\\nYeah, you kind of are.

I am also not here to tell you that your wife who cheated on you is the victim in this situation, because she sure as hell isn\\'t.\\n\\nWhat I **am** here to tell you is that if something is a huge giant traumatic deal to your spouse the proper response to it is not \"I don\\'t care.\" Even if you don\\'t care you should still at least discuss the giant thing that\\'s been eating her up for days. She clearly cares about it a great deal and clearly equates monogamy with love. You don\\'t, that\\'s fine, you do you. But knowing that monogamy is a huge deal to her and she broke it means you need to acknowledge that this is a big deal to her, not laugh it off and go back to watching tv. I\\'m a little gobsmacked I need to explain that.\\n\\nThen there\\'s the drinking component to this. She herself says she was very drunk. Maybe she felt like she wasn\\'t fully in control of the situation. Maybe she felt like this guy got her liquored up enough to where she wasn\\'t able to make an informed decision about consent. Maybe the reason I keep having to say \"maybe\" is because you asked her exactly zero followup questions and blew the whole thing off despite how clearly upset she was. Are you starting to get the big picture here, yet?\\n\\nBottom line your partner wanted to talk about something that really upset them.

If she did it anyway and is now mad that you’re not mad, it’s almost like she did it because she wants out of the relationship but doesn’t want to do it herself.  In her mind 1.) you’re mad and want a divorce.  2.) you’re not mad and don’t care about her and she wants a divorce.  It’s kind of brilliant in her part.\\n\\nGoing forward, she broke trust in a big way.  Given the way she reacted herself, I doubt being polyamorous is in her wheelhouse, and if she’s going to cheat, she’ll probably do it again, especially if you don’t care.

I want to give you three theories as to why she is angry and is acting like this.\\n\\nTheory 1: like the crazy comments suggest she was testing you to see if you cared enough about the relationship by cheating. She most likely knew your past so she cheated to see if you would react and prove you care about her and the relationship. Completely crazy as I said due to if you had “her values” for monogamy then the relationship would have ended. The reason she would be upset is due to you not reacting the way she wanted.\\n\\nTheory 2: she wanted a divorce and didn’t want to talk about it like adults should. This theory is the most likely. The reason she would be upset is due to you not divorcing her.\\n\\nTheory 3: she wanted to cheat and make you the villain. The way she would accomplish this is by you getting angry at her cheating and probably throw her out of the house. After she is thrown out she runs to friends and family and tells them your an abuser. They immediately sympathize with her and say what she did wasn’t her fault and blame you instead. This then could lead to cops being called and you falsely arrested. Not super likely this is correct, but it has happened before.\\n\\nThought I’m sure she wouldn’t tell you the real reason as she has lied already. All in all your NTA. The weirdo’s who are trying to justify her actions in the comments are not helpful.', 'NTA. You have a healthier perspective on it all than most and you sound very loving with her.  She’s going through a major growth and maturing in her understanding right now and it doesn’t come without a lot of big mess emotion as we let go of who we thought we were. Remember her identity was largely built around monogamy. But she doesn’t understand yet that meaning is constructed.  She’s constructed her identity around monogamy, and so when she transgresses that there is also “real” meaning to it. \\n\\nThere’s an also an ego trip going on within lower self functioning where you want your partner to be jealous of you as if that signifies and conveys meaning. \\n\\nAlternatively, she could use this to destruct your whole relationship. People who think this way use cheating as a way to end things when they don’t have the courage to do so otherwise. Because it transgresses a widely accepted convention it forces the other person to break up with them when they don’t want to do that dirty work themselves in the traditional approach to cheating. \\n\\nIf it is really about her looking for signifiers of how you feel toward her, you can reframe this for her. There’s so much love in how you treat her just by what I read. Making her a cup of tea, really caring enough to know why she’s distant to the point that you push for the uncomfortable conversation, accepting whatever her answer is with love and teaching her to laugh off something so overly heavily serious brooding over her by showing her a different perspective on it…you’ve been extremely loving to her over this and the signifiers of that are right there for the seeing, or in her case the pointing out.  If you can help her see that you will help her grow. \\n\\nIf on the other hand she’s using it to emotionally shut things down between you, even if her story becomes “it was too good so I had to ruin it in self sabotage” as an excuse to change your relationship terms, i.e. the beginning of her path out, I would confront her head on on with that - do you want this to change this? Do you want out?  If no great, if yes let’s get a really good therapist where the best we can do is work through it clearly and cleanly if you really don’t want to be in this relationship. Hopefully that’s not the case and she’s just confused and coming face-to-face with her deep seated beliefs about what really is “moral.” And what love really is. \\n\\nIt’s important for you to realize that even though you don’t see it as a transgression she sees it as a transgression so it’s important that you acknowledge and address that.

      "Post Title:  AITAH for telling my husband he was feeding our baby wrong.\n",
      "content:  My (24f) husband (35m) and I have a one-year-old (15mo) daughter. He works full-time and is trying to go back to school. I'm the one who does most of the baby care and cooking and cleaning. Before we got married I told him I wanted to be the stay-at-home mom when we had kids because I knew that he would have liked to be a stay-at-home dad if I was willing to work instead. He does help with baby care like feeding, bathing, and changing her diaper but I usually am the one to do most of it, especially feeding her.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the last few 2 or 3 months I have been struggling because I don't feel like he is listening when I tell him what I normally feed her. I will give some examples. Several weeks ago he got up early on a Saturday and did her normal morning routine, got her dressed and changed her diaper ect. The only problem was I normally feed her breakfast and then put her in her room to play with a small snack like Cheerios and her sippy cup with water. He didn't feed her breakfast, he just gave her milk and put her in her room to play. I woke up and found out that he got her up for me and thought that was nice and asked what he fed her for breakfast. He said he didn't, he just gave her milk. I was annoyed but I reminded him that she shouldn't just be having milk for a meal anymore. Cow's milk isn't like formula and even if it was formula, she's old enough that she's supposed to be eating real food. I think that should have been enough of a conversation for him to at least not do that specific thing anymore. I was wrong, the very next Saturday he did the exact same thing. No breakfast, just milk. Once she has the milk I can't feed her breakfast anymore because she's no longer hungry. so when he snapped at me and said \"if you don't like the way I do things, you can do it yourself.\" I couldn't really correct it that morning because she wouldn't eat. He hasn't gotten her up in the morning since.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to yesterday. He came home from work and will often times go play with the baby for a bit before he does homework or other things. This time I asked him to get her up from her nap and \"give her some chex and fill up her water.\" I assumed he did this so when we went in to play with her and then get her some dinner I was confused. Normally I give her plain rice chex or plain cheerios. I don't want her eating too much sugar at this point in her life unless it comes from fruit. He knows this and yet when I walked into her room I smelled the blueberry chex that he had given her. I also noticed that he gave her milk. Recently I have told him that I've only been giving her milk before nap and bedtime because if I don't she chugs it and won't eat anything else. So he did two things that I know I have told him previously not to do. When I asked him about the chex he said I didn't specify which ones, which is true but I thought that he would have remembered about the sugar thing. Then I asked why he gave her milk when he knows that we only do that before she sleeps and he said to our baby \"I'm ignoring her.\"  I said \"I feel like you don't listen to a word I say.\" and I promptly grabbed the dishes in her room and left. I went outside to walk our dog in the backyard so I could cool off.\n",
      "\n",
      "After I came in I kinda just ignored him and did some dishes while he gave the baby carrots. I got her a few other things to eat and finished doing dishes. Then we put her to bed and by the next 30 minutes I was talking to him again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The point is am I being too controlling with her food and/or a jerk for getting mad at him for seemingly not listening to me?\n",
      "\n",
      "ETA: It seems that many people agree that I am being a wee bit crazy. I will have another discussion with my husband and work out some compromises. I know that he loves our daughter and he is also trying to do what's best for her. She is happy and healthy and that is what is important. I am going to work on relaxing about this because I see that it is not necessary for me to be so uptight about it. Thank you for all the advice!\n",
      "\n",
      "ETA2: since people were asking about my husband wanting to be a stay-at-home dad. Here was my comment.\n",
      "What I meant by that was if he had married a career woman who wanted kids but was okay with her husband being a stay-at-home dad, he would have liked that. Or if we lived in a world where anyone and everyone could work at home and he could spend infinitely more time with his children he would have liked that too. I too dreamed about being a mom whose job it was to take care of her children. He decided to allow me to be the stay-at-home mom because he knows I would be happier doing that than any job I'd work. He also knows that he has many interests that he enjoys getting paid to do and I don't.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just felt like that was very long and slightly irrelevant to add to my post but I shall add it because people were wondering about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "ETA3: I have had a discussion with my husband and we got all our feelings out on both sides and both apologized to eachother. We were able to come up with a plan to help us both be happier while managing our baby's food. Thank you for everyone's perspectives, they were helpful to see!\n",

Now the part that bothers me is when you were talking to him and although the baby doesn’t understand it’s still very underhanded for him to look away from you and tell a baby that he’s ignoring you. At that point it’s like he’s doing out of spite. The whole “if you don’t like how I do it then do it yourself” is a cop out so he can be the fun parents and you’re the strict parents. You both need to be on the same level of parenting. There should be no separation in which parents is fun and which parent makes rules. Coparenting isn’t just for couple who are separated.

He’s already been f*cking fed. Interfering with sh*t you don’t even know.” It’s not his dog, my dad bought the dog for my mum but he has deluded himself into thinking the dog belongs to him. He doesn’t feed the dog, doesn’t buy the dog food, doesn’t clean up the dog mess, doesn’t tidy up when the dog pees inside.

      "\n",
      "Background (idk if any of this info is relevant but I'll say it anyways):\n",
      "I used to be homeschooled. I started public school my freshman year of highschool (2020-21, online because of covid). I had been in a relationship once before (not with Logan), in 2020. We did do handsy stuff in that relationship, but never had sex. \n",
      "\n",
      "Logan and I had been good friends for a while, because we had been in the same German class at school for two years in a row. I started liking him the end of my sophomore year, but knew it would never happen because he had a girlfriend. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sally went to a different school than Logan and I, so I didn't know her very well. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to december 2022. I was in my junior year and Logan was a senior. He sent me a text asking if I wanted to go watch the United World Wrestling freestyle world cup. He told me that his mother won two tickets at her workplace, and she didn't want to go. I asked Logan why he didn't invite Sally, and he said it was because she didn't like loud noises. (I also don't like loud noises, so I understand that. I don't understand why he asked me to go because he knew I didn't like loud noises either.) \n",
      "I said that I would like to go with him. Tbh, this was my first time hanging out with friends outside of school without parents around, so I was pretty excited. \n",
      "\n",
      "When getting ready to go, I remember choosing pants that were easy to come off. I don't know why I did that. I think I was hoping that he would tell me that he'd break up with his girlfriend for me and we would have sex. \n",
      "\n",
      "Only one of those things happened. \n",
      "\n",
      "He picked me up in his car and drove ~30 minutes to the venue. We watched wrestling. We started getting really close and he kissed me. We made out. I started getting uncomfortable with the fact that we were making out and there were children sitting behind us. I asked if we could go back to his car. We did. He asked me front seat or back, I said back. We made out and then had sex (with protection). He didn't come. \n",
      "\n",
      "Afterwards, I asked Logan what he was going to tell his girlfriend. He said he wouldn't tell her, but he agreed to after I pushed it. \n",
      "\n",
      "He never told her. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sally found out about him and I going together  because I made an instagram post with a selfie of Logan and I. Sally messaged me asking about it. Sally told me that Logan said that he went to the wrestling thing with his handicapped grandmother. I told Sally about Logan and I having sex. She was furious with him. They broke up shortly after. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then a lot of things happened, and Sally and I thought about dating. She eventually cut things off because I reminded her too much of Logan. \n",
      "\n",
      "I left a lot of details out for the sake of brevity, so if any questions needs to be answered I am open to it. I made this post because even though it feels like what I did might have been wrong, no one irl has said that to me.\n",

      "Edit: I am starting to regret having posted this without keeping all the details in. \n",
      "\n",
      "For starters, I didn't do anything with bad intentions in mind. Yes, I was only thinking of myself and it was selfish, but I didn't do anything for nefarious reasons. \n",
      "Second, Sally and I became really good friends after this happened, and she told me that he had treated her terribly and disrespected her boundaries, so she didn't miss him. \n",
      "Last, even though this is hard to type, I want to say thank you to the people who have been responding and being honest. I didn't think what I had done was so bad, but I now realize how much I need to grow before I am ready for a relationship again.\n",

Last year we had a class where it was just us two sat at a table meant for 4 the whole year. I’m a huge sports fan, (basketball, Football, and Soccer to be exact) and it was easy for us to go into discussions about these sports. I thought he was cool because he agreed to watch the World Cup with me (I begged him to put his computer next to mine to watch both of the final group-stage games at once) All we really did was talk mess about the other's favorite team/players and things like that.

Me saying yes to that seemed to flip some kinda switch in him and before I knew it he was oddly conscious of my feelings and things I like, no more jokingly making fun of me or the teams I like, he started bringing extra food and drinks to school; always offering me some, and he asked me to go to amusement parks, soccer games, and even his track meets. I always said no because I'm a hermit and our local soccer team is dogshit. I still thought these were friendly invites and that's on me for not reading between the lines.

He asked me what he was doing all that stuff for if we weren't dating. I assume \"stuff\" meant being nice to me but whatever. All my friends have told me that he was obviously into me. Some are saying I led him on and others are saying otherwise but they all agree that he clearly wanted to date me. Others who barely knew me around school thought we were already dating even before that event.

      "content:  I, X23, have been best friends with F23 since we were 16. For the story, let's call her Jessie. \n",
      "\n",
      "Jessie and I went to high school together where we got really close. We've since moved to different places for university. We've remained close and frequently referred to each other as soulmates. \n",
      "\n",
      "A couple of years ago, Jessie came into money problems and I, being her best friend of 5-ish years at the time offered to help her with around $500 almost every month for a defined time period until she could get back on her feet financially. At first, she was reluctant, but then accepted my offer. However, after that time was over, she kept asking for money. She'd ask for everything from $20 to $500 every now and again. Eventually, I sat her down and told her I couldn't afford to spend that kind of money and also told her that I couldn't afford to keep paying for everything whenever we'd do things together either. That ended with her telling me a sob story about her trauma. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had always paid for the small things. A cup of coffee here, a pizza there. One time I racked up a $300 bar tab paying for our drinks and snacks for a night out. It sometimes seemed to me that she didn't notice that I always did these things whenever we hung out. In the beginning, I was always happy to do these things, but the prices for what's expected have slowly gone up. \n",
      "\n",
      "Last summer she called me one night telling me she'd locked herself out of her apartment. She asked if I could come to pick her up. I didn't have access to a car that night so I said that wouldn't be possible. She has other friends in the area, but she had lied to those friends and told them she was living with her parents so they wouldn't come over. I tried everything under the fucking sun. She could tell them her family was on vacation? Nope, she didn't like that idea. She could call the guy she was seeing? Nope. He didn't have a car (neither did I). The whole thing ended with me ordering her, and paying for, a taxi so that she could go to his place. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'd saved up a bit of money to travel later that summer. I landed hoping for a stress-free holiday, turned off flight mode and the first thing I saw was a message from her asking for money. I caved. Both of these events were after I told her I couldn't afford to keep sending her money. \n",
      "\n",
      "There was more than just money to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She'd frequently call me to tell me about how her group of friends at home turned out to be awful people. In the almost 5 years since I moved away, she's not maintained any other friend than me. Every time I'd keep telling her that yeah, those things those people did was awful. I gave advice until my tongue gave out and she'd still end up in those friendships all over again. I later realized that she was my only source of information in these conflicts and that, seeing as the only common denominator was her, she may have been more guilty in those friendships failing than I may have thought. She'd position us as sort of a \"us against the world\" thing, where there'd constantly be something wrong with everyone else. I would indulge her. Socially her world has more recently started being about romance. And she'd often call me to talk for hours on end about these boys and the drama that ensued after the situationships were over. I'd frequently tell her that none of this is up my alley and that I didn't understand her drama. I always thought the whole situation was childish. \n",
      "\n",
      "She's made a routine of calling me up the night before her exams and telling me that she's sure she'll fail. At first, I tried my very best to make a rigid system that she had to follow (homework and readings and so on). It always seemed to me like she thought her education was so much more difficult than everyone else's, and she'd often complain about things that were perfectly normal for all university students as if I would go \"nooo? omg, that's so tough\". At first, I tried the sympathy road, but then it kept going and I had to put my foot down. \n",
      "\n",
      "She's had such difficulty with getting her academic record straight that at one point I wrote an at-home exam for her. I have an A in a class I did not take. My education is not similar to hers, but this was just a subject I sorta knew from experience and got an A in. It's her only A. I cannot remember if I offered to write it, or if she asked me to. \n",

      "This barely scratches the surface, but I think you get the gist. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, this is where the whole I-may-be-the-asshole thing comes in to play. I've recently told her to get a therapist before she talks to me again. That I feel is a fair call. However, I've always indulged the behavior or been some form of a catalyst to it. I offered to lend her money first, I offered to help her with things, I started the conversation around dropping friends you don't enjoy, I indulged her, I said it was fine to lie to her friends so that she could protect her peace at home.

Well written & articulate but you've been living this life that your parents have normalized (but it definitely isn't normal) so it seems you've been desensitized to things you shouldn't be. Roaches? Those things might follow you around for the rest of your life. I don't know how long you've been dealing with those but just know if you see 1 roach, you've definitely got thousands in the walls. This is not normal. Also fast food and crap for every meal? Does no one ever cook at all in your family? You're stomach probably hates you because of this. Idk it just seems like a terrible environment to live and I would definitely consider your parents as shitty parents, sorry. \\n\\nTo answer your question, don't worry about it.

      "Timeline to this wild ride:\n",
      "I (28 F now) was in a relationship with Jed( 28 M now) for 5 years. He was a bartender and we allowed flirting but nothing more in our relationship. He did for work and I’m just kind of a flirty person without meaning to be. When I was younger I had very low self esteem and male attention made me feel better. Not great but not uncommon. It’s something that I’ve grown up a lot and away from. We started dating when we were 19. A lot changed by the time we were 26. Jed became an alcoholic and had erectile dysfunction. I suffer from pretty bad depression, I can be really negative and talk about my feelings too much. I think very deeply about the world and philosophy. I’m not everyone’s cup of tea. We stop having sex and he stop even attempting to get me off. But I still loved him and just thought we hit a rough patch. He got a job out of state and that was the nail in the coffin.\n",
      "\n",
      "A month before my break with Jed I reconnected with an old friend from high school while I was visiting my parent, his name Lee (28 M)Lee was getting his life together . He had a failed entertainment career and just gotten out of a long relationship, but had been sober for two years. We talk about philosophy, sobriety, mysteries of life. It’s great I never get to talk to anyone about this stuff. He was now living with his parents in our home city. We really hit it off as friends. He wants to come visit me in my state.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jed and I break up when he takes the job in another state. Lee had already planned his trip to visit me. We have a blast and I took him backpacking for the first time. We ended up hooking up. I told him I really liked him but he said he had other plans to go join this cult. He’s been interested in spirituality since getting sober. Red flag but I’m empathetic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lee and I keep talking on the phone. Me and our other friend convince him not to join the cult.\n",
      "\n",
      "I start seeing my friend Jake (28 M) casually. I’m exploring things after the end of my long relationship. Neither of us are interested in each other in a serious way. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lee calls me randomly and tells me loves me and he wants to come to live with me in my state. I’m overwhelmed by this. I’m also just starting to see someone else because I thought he was going to join a cult.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then my mom starts dying. What a wild ride already.\n",
      "\n",
      "I return home for a few months while my mom was quickly dying from cancer and I really connect with Lee. He was very kind and there for me. I really like him but he just seemed so lost. \n",
      "\n",
      "After my mom died I return to the state I live and start drinking heavily. Lee judges me harshly for this. However I am meeting a lot of people and surrounding myself with friends. People grieve differently. I’m starting to be confused about what I want with Lee. I love him and could spending the rest of my life with him but felt pressured into a relationship too quickly and he’s kind of a dead weight with no degree or career. I feel guilty for feeling this way. Our sex life is okay. I really like him though and I try look past it. Jake had given me my first orgasm in my life. I feel guilty. I don’t why I can’t orgasm with Lee. I feel horrible. I don’t want to talk to Lee about it because I don’t want hurt his feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s where I might be the asshole. I’m on molly at an event and Jake kissed me and I kissed back. I feel awful. There is no excuse for that. I tell Lee immediately and he’s heartbroken. He want to work it out but I tell him that I want to get my shit together. Lee asks if we could friends and to just keep talking to him, but he doesn’t want to hear about any boys. Lee moves to another state and goes to back to school.\n",
      "\n",
      "I start going to therapy, quit drinking heavily. Quit my shitty job that I hated. Get an awesome new job. I climbed Kilimanjaro . Started Hanging out with different people. I still made some bad decisions . Jake and I still hook up cause I’m single and I don’t owe anyone anything. I realize that’s a huge jerk but that’s perfect for a casual hookup and I learn what I like sexually. \n",
      "\n",
      "Until my IUDs fails. I end up pregnant. Jake pressures me into an abortion and abandons me at the clinic. He was a jerk but I didn’t expect that level of sociopathy.\n",
      "The abortion was very traumatic. I start to think I’ve been cursed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I continue my therapy, but the depression is coming back. \n",
      "\n",
      "I go celibate after the abortion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lee and I still talk. He since converted to Christianity (Lutheran) Which I’m happy for him but I’m an atheist. I was a little resistant at first to his conversion. We start talking more and more. He tells me it’s fine that I’m an atheist.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have an opportunity to visit the city he goes to college in. We reconnect. He tells me he still loves me and always did. He does tell me he wants to join the clergy. I hesitate. I told him about everything that happened the year we were apart. He’s very supportive and understanding.\n",

He doesn’t want to “feel like my therapist” he then sites my relationship with Jed and the flirting that was established and implied I’m a whore. Caused me of using him as emotional support when my mom died. I didn’t flirt with anyone else while we were dating he established that.

And that's perfectly fine. He can't get mad at you for things you did when you two weren't together. And honestly, he can't use it against you either because you two were never in a committed relationship.

      "\n",
      "I met \"Kylie\" playing an MMO online during the pandemic. We bonded over both being late bloomers. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've never dated seriously because I've been focusing on finishing an MSc and starting a PhD. I've been self-conscious for awhile that my longest relationship lasted like four months when I was 19. Just flings/casual since.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kylie did distance/homeschool in high school due to severe bullying in middle school. Then she did a distance program for college and is just a caregiver for her grandma right now, so her social circle is nil and she's never felt confident enough to put herself out there. I thought this was more special than weird, like I found a unicorn, a woman in my age bracket that hasn't dated properly either, but maybe I wasn't thinking it fully through.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, we grew close over the last three years. We'd voice chat while playing, sort of be flirty over text sometimes. We did exchange pictures, and while she was obviously not super model hot (nor am I!), I thought she had a kind of a nerdy gamer girl-next-door appeal. (Yes, we should have video-chatted. I feel stupid.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd be lying if I said I wasn't hoping I'd found \"the one.\" She's been ridicullously supportive of my studies, even mailing me care packages during exams, stressful times at the lab, ect. (she's from Canada, I grew up in Houston but live in the UK). \n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to this month, where she finally received respite care for her grandma for two weeks and wanted to go on a trip. We were both excited about the possility of her coming here for a meet-up. \n",
      "\n",
      "She's been AGAIN saintly about it. Reminding me that it'll be ok if we don't click like \"that,\" she's also happy to be a solo tourist here instead, never wants to make me uncomfortable so if at any time I change my mind about a plan we make or something, honor those feelings, ect. From bullying, I think she's just so self-aware of trying to make other people not feel forced to be around her if they don't want to be because no one ever \"liked her.\" (red flag??)\n",
      "\n",
      "I met her at the airport yesterday and I was so nervous about making a good first impression, that I just didn't \"see\" her properly, if that makes sense. Like how it doesn't matter if your interviewer is a jowly bald old man in sweatpants, you still put on a suit and are anxious about your own appearance moreso. All I know is that she wasn't a catfish and didn't run away screaming from my ugly mug, so I felt it was a win.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, she gave me a gift from Canada, like maple candies and a book from an author in her hometown that writes in my field of study, which made me feel like a huge asshole for not bringing her anything, so I was even more anxious about coming off wrong. I helped her get to her hotel, and we went to a museum, and then we met up with my friend group for drinks and supper because they all really wanted to meet my \"online girlfriend of three years.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to mention that at the museum, Kylie was great to be around. She was funny, making fun of herself for not knowing certain things, interested in learning about the exhibits, kept the conversation going when I didn't know what to say, and OVER THE TOP NICE. Like, this woman cupped a moth in her hands to bring it back outside nice. She somehow got to talking to an employee about how he was a political refugee missing his family trapped in his home country, and she fucking gave this 50-year-old man a hug \"from his daughters\", made him cry, and said that she knew he'd be giving his family a tour there someday very soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at dinner with my friends, absolutely no one clicked with her. It was awkward as hell. She got quiet in the group setting, which she said she does but still I thought she might try to be more gregarious to make a good impression with them. My friends were giving me looks, rolling their eyes behind her back. I felt like I was put in the middle between a \"stranger\" and people who I see every day, so I was trying to placate them moreso and ended the night early without going to the second pub.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, I told Kylie that it would be better if she explored the city on her own because I wasn't feeling well. She again made me feel like shit by being super concerned/nice and asking if I needed her to get me anything, like meds or food, but just was 100% supportive and said she'd share pictures of her adventures today. She also apologised for being quiet with my friends, and that she's not great with crowds, but she enjoyed meeting everyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The truth is that for the rest of the night after we split from my friends, my friend group chat (I will say, mostly terminally in school men aged 20s-late 30s working in a 100% male dominated academic lab) completely roasted Kylie and said I am undervaluing myself by that being my potential \"the one.\" They took pictures from her social media and compared them to this \"objective female attractiveness chart\" from a Reddit sub and \"proved\" to me that she's objectively a 2/10, and then \"proved\" to me that based on my pictures, I'm a 5.5 and need to go for someone more in my league.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before anyone says it, yes, I tried to defend her by talking up how weirdly nice she was/is, how supportive of my studies, she's not that bad looking, ect, but it was just everyone agreeing that \"bro you're going to have a PhD and she is very low value.\" I do see what they mean in that she looks the most like women in the 2/2.5 category of that chart, and I don't look like the men in the 2/2.5 chart.\n",
      "\n",
      "It did make me reflect more on her appearance, which is more middle-agey than cute gamer girl. I'm trying to be delicate here...she has a very large chest that...sags? So she looks bigger around the middle. And she's also very tall, almost 6 foot, with a bit of \"gamer shoulders,\" and doesn't wear makeup or dress up, so not like someone the lads would fist bump you over landing. When you imagine the word \"girlfriend,\" you see...not her. I still thought she was cute in a \"woman from the office\" way, but I don't know.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I've been reflecting and like, would it be the lesser asshole move to just do what she said was okay, ghost her and let her be a tourist on her trip and work on starting to date someone more in line with my own appearance? Is it the fucking vainest shit in the world to drop someone for your friend's telling you you can do better?\n",
      "\n",
      "I talked to my sister, who told me that I'm being a dumbass because very soon I'll be a 40+ balding middle aged man, and then an old man, and looks don't matter anymore at that point. She said, is our grandmother not a \"hottie\" with her wrinkly neck and arthritic shoe supports and so my beer-belly grandfather with no teeth should drop her? That's not what \"love\" is.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how could I get over everyone in my immediate circle, 10+ guys who I see every day, slagging me over my girl. They even started calling her \"Kyle\" and said I should double-check she wasn't born a man because of her height and big nose. I'm just too socially awkward to fight them over it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would miss our gaming sessions and her care packages and how she lets me vent about work/school, but that's me being into what she is from a distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, would I be the asshole if I ghosted her here (which she said was okay before she left!), let her have fun on her trip, and just signed up for Tinder instead, or am I losing out on what \"true love\" is??\n",

We did everything together, movies, hanging out at the mall, sleepovers, etc. Something that is important to know, Ash came from a poorer background than myself. My family is not rich, more like middle class. We had our struggles but we were fortunate enough not to ever have to wonder where our next meal would come from while Ash has.\n",

      "* I always pay for food when we go out, usually when Ash mentioned that they had not eaten in x amount of days.\n",
      "* Ash always made a big deal of me paying them for something if they did end up paying but never did it with our other friends\n",
      "* When a classmate of mine passed that our older brother was close to, I mentioned I did not want to listen to a song that would remind me of him. Ash proceeded to put the song on crank it up and belt the lyrics out.\n",
      "* I tripped once and accidentally broke a bag when I reached out to break my fall. Ash made me buy them a new one despite the fact I’d bruised up my leg pretty good\n",
      "* If I mentioned someone said I look like I lost weight (I'm plus size), Ash would say “You probably haven’t, they just haven’t seen you in a while”\n",

I almost passed out cold at the kitchen table randomly. My brother who was a volunteer firefighter at the time had to help me to the couch and he took my vitals. I was fine mostly, just really weak.

I think whatever happened contributed to the way they acted in the office.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also talked about my ADHD diagnosis a lot because I was explaining the extra accommodations I got including a note-taker and extended test-taking time in school. Ash mentioned that they think they have Autism because they’re not socially literate. I told them they should research more about ADHD in female-presenting people (they didn't come out as NB until after we reconnected) because Autism and ADHD have a tendency to either go hand-in-hand or even be misdiagnosed as one or the other (I was tested a few times in my childhood so we could keep my accommodations). Ash got mad at me and was quiet the rest of the time I was there.\n",
      "\n",
      "I later got a text telling me that self-diagnosis is valid with three TikTok videos talking about it. I was annoyed so I sent back an article from a medical journal detailing the similarities and differences between the two and how they interact.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few days later, Ash was suddenly saying they have ADHD and mimicking some of my ticks like picking at my lip or digging my nails into the back of my hand. These were things they never did before. I tried to tell myself that ADHD sometimes causes people to mimic things others do, and Ash may have been masking before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing was, Ash would only seem to want to hang out with me on their own. They would regularly make it clear to me that their apartment that they now shared with their BF and friend was always open to people, but whenever I would ask if I could come over I was told “Oh, we're having a D&D session tonight” They had one every night.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like D&D and the one campaign I was in always got pushed and I was berated for wanting to miss one night because it was Father’s day. There was also one night where I asked if I could do a maneuver a specific way and the rules of the world don’t allow for it, which is fine that’s why I asked. I made a “that’s rude” comment in a joking manner, the two other people chuckled but Ash’s boyfriend snapped at me and I sat there confused and just said it was a joke and one of the others told him that it was a reference to a character. All he said was “oh” and the campaign moved on. I did not get an apology.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day Ash told me that they don’t like when I say that comment because it makes them feel bad. So I stopped saying it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that was when it started to hit me. That Ash wasn’t a good friend to me. I was back to doing the same things as before and paying for things for them that I shouldn’t be. I tried to back off with it, to see how it would affect us, and I noticed more passive-aggressive tendencies from them and their BF.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last straw was when I gave Ash a big container of soup my mom made (she always makes too much). I later found it a month later sitting in the breakroom fridge. I asked Ash to take it home and clean the container so I could return it. Their response was “You know I don’t like touching gross and old food” in frustration I glared at them and walked out because I didn’t want to snap.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning, the container was gone and their BF came in and dropped it on the counter, now clean. I gave him a dirty look and said “Finally, it’s been a month since I gave that to Ash.” He looked a little surprised but didn’t say anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was a Friday. Once I was home I texted Ash that I was done and to not talk to me for anything but work again. I admit it was nasty, but I detailed some of the above and said I was tired of being the one to give the most as a friend. I know I shouldn’t have, but I had a little to drink, and ended it with “You always say that your friends leave you and treat you like crap later on. Maybe that’s because you’re the problem. I hope your BF gets a clue before you marry and leaves you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It felt so good. I didn’t regret telling them off but I knew I shouldn’t have added that last bit about their BF. Regardless, I decided not to apologize and just move on. A few months later, I got a good full-time job and left. Ash stormed out of the office a week after I put in my notice when one of our coworkers asked me about what I would be making/doing (she was interested in the same field).\n",
      "\n",
      "What brings me to is a conversation with an old classmate. We were always friendly but never close to either of us. She asked me why Ash and I were not friends anymore and I gave them a rundown of why. That classmate told me I was AH because Ash came from a difficult home life and it wasn’t fair to expect them to cater to someone who came from a privileged background and that Ash is still poor and working a barely more than minimum wage job.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn’t know what to do, so I just changed the subject. Now I’m sitting here in my room with no one to talk to wondering if she was right. Ash was the only friend I had for a long time and now I don’t make new ones because I didn’t want to be hurt again but I can’t help but think that I’m the one in the wrong.AITA?\n",

You weren’t asking Ash to cater to you, you were asking for the basic respect and consideration you would expect from anyone, but especially from a close friend. While I do think the difference in your upbringing contributed to why they are more particular about their possessions and felt like they could comfortably ask you to pay them back, that doesn’t give them permission to take advantage of you and take you for granted. It sounds to me that they were a resentful of what you had and would act out because of it but that doesn’t mean you should allow yourself to be disrespected. \\n\\nPlus many of these aren’t related to money or possessions at all and seemed like they were just trying to hurt you and invalidate your feelings. Even if not intentionally trying to hurt you, it’s definitely not with your consideration in mind. That alone is a good enough reason to not be friends.']\n",

      "I have a friend named, let's say - Erin (20F). We have been friends since sophmore year of high school. We hung out a good bit in and outside of school, but mostly hung out online playing games. In late 2018, I decided for fun to start streaming on Twitch. She would hang out in my chat and it was a good way to connect with her and other like minded folk. About a year later, she started streaming as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "After graduation, I moved across the country to be closer to family and for college. We stayed close by streaming together (Apex Legends, Fortnite, etc) or hanging out in each other's streams, along with just chatting via discord. \n",
      "\n",
      "I want to preface this by saying, I really like this friend (as a friend). It's nice to have a gaming buddy, someone for advice and help with Twitch, and just a friend in general. I will say that she is an artist so she has made my emotes and layouts for me, she has donated a decent chunk of change over time to me, subscribes every month, and mods in my chat, which are all a huge help. It makes me feel as though I owe her somewhat.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past, we have had our arguments about what have you twitch wise or just as friends. If it is \"really bad\", we just don't talk for a few days and eventually move on. But within the past year, it seems as though she has gotten really mean and rude towards me. I will say that the majority of the time, this is on Twitch streams or discord calls (while on stream), rather than private messages. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am writing this because just tonight, something happened that killed my mood and brought up this whole subject enough that I can't sleep. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had a long day and people in my discord asked me to stream something tonight. I said I had a long day, car issues, college, etc. I was tired and wasn't there to commit to a high energy stream. I decided to destress with a Fortnite stream, but made it clear I wasn't going to be super energized, we'll just chill in chat and play a few games. Erin comes in and asks me to switch to Apex Legends, which I ignored cause I  chose what I was doing. Then she asked if she could join me in Duos in Fortnite, which I said was fine, but I had to head to bed soon. In the period between the time she asked and the time I died in game, she said, \"Eric, shut up. you need to make your streams more entertaining please, i'm bored\", (i said i was low energy tonight and) \"STREAMS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ENTERTAINING,  IM WATCHING A GUY SUCK AT FORTNITE\". In defense, I jokingly said how she isn't a pro herself and she said, \"i make it funny, you don't.\" Then, \"Guitarlaw (another chatter in stream), please tell him you hate the stream please.\" The chatter said, sure? Erin said \"YEAAAAA\". Later, \"you need a funny bit.  you think making puns out of his name is funny.  like bro it's not all about you. Jack (fellow streamer friend) is a funnier streamer than you. bro has bits.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "This is my #1 Twitch pet peeve and its \"dance monkey.\" People wave money or sometimes just their viewership over your head and ask you to entertain them when I owe them nothing. This is my stream and in a world where I don't control much, I control and can cultivate my Twitch chat. I have been streaming for 5 years now. I am not doing it to \"go big\". Its just fun to hangout with friends I know have through streaming and honestly really helps with my lonelieness since I am so far away from \"home\". I have developed over that time a very \"take it or leave it\" mentality about watching my stream. You want to pop in, chat, have a good time? Awesome, so happy and thankful you're here. Don't want to watch/don't have time/whatever? Totally fine, my stream isn't that important and life is busy. Not everything I will stream will be your cup of tea as well and that's totally okay too! But when you come into stream and tell me it's boring, I need to be better, so and so is so much better, etc - it ticks me off so much. And so this is multiplied times ten when it is a FRIEND. \n",
      "\n",
      "I asked her when I died if we were playing and she goes, \"no cause I don't feel like it now. I don't want to play with an unfunny guy. you make me wanna rip my hair out.\" Mind you, this is all said in a public Twitch chat with other viewers watching. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the past year, there have been more situations where she is just like this. She says it is an online persona and that she is mean in chat, but not IRL. I am very self conscious and I can take some teasing, but after a while, it just feels rude. I also feel like Erin's opinion matters more to me than a random chatter. Someone says the stream sucks and they can be banned, whereas Erin's opinion matters. In all honestly, I think her \" online persona\" thing is an excuse and she is just using it to be an ass. \n",
      "\n",
      "During a conversation previously (just last month) over discord DMs, she said \"my mom told me that i can be very mean when im on my period. so yeah, if im every extra bitchy towards you just know its cause of my period!! i know theres been times in your twitch chat where i have been mean and i apologize. can't help it. most of the time i am kidding and theres that 5% when im not on my period and i just dont stop myself from being mean.\"  \n",
      "\n",
      "Another time I complained about comments people made about me in stream (mostly her, but i wanted to go to her and act like it was the other comments that were bothering me to see what she would say about mean twitch comments.) \"You're the one making the choice to put yourself out there and if you can't handle what you get back in return then maybe it just isn't for you.\" (April 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "It is for me. I adore streaming to my (on a really good night) ten or so viewers. We have a great time and I go on tangents about whatever it may be. I have grown geniune online friendships that out of this. Seriously, it helps me with my depression to get up and see \"UmbrellaMan12\" or whatever and just ask how they're doing and play some games. \n",
      "\n",
      "At the very same time, when she says these type of things to me, I'll be real and say that I say simular things back, which is fine if we are doing this friendly back and forth but it always seems like she can say whatever she wants to me and \"its just a joke, man up!\" but is sensitive herself. I feel like I am walking on eggshells talking with her. (even when not doing something like this, just in normal conversation, she can just get pissed off of something I didn't think would even make her mad - like literally normal conversation.) I would rather we didn't go back and forth at all, but it feel as though she enjoys it. \n",
      "\n",
      "For context on Erin, we graduated high school in summer 2021. Since then, I have moved and worked fulltime 40/50 hours a week for about a year and a half before enrolling in college (which I am doing now.) Erin is an only child and lives at home. She hasn't gone to school and works part time at a local grocery store, which is totally fine. That said, (and not to say that I am this big mature 21 year old) I think living on my own, paying expensive rent, bills, groceries, saving and buying a car, going to school and enteracting with people, etc - I think that experience has changed me for the better and I think Erin might still be a high school grad if you get what I mean. I truly don't mean anything rude by it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's my dilemma that I need help on. (thank you so much for reading all of this, i know its a lot) What would you do? Some people have told me to cut her off or somethings along that line. As stated, she has donated/done so much for me that I feel like I almost owe her to be her friend at this point. I would bet that she is pretty lonely herself, only interacting with (majority) coworkers and her parents. I like her a lot as a friend, but it is just A LOT for me. Should I try explaining to her how I feel? How would I go about doing that without her being pissed off at me or telling me to \"man up\"? I honestly through writing this feel like I might be being used by her in some way? I apperciate what she has done for me and would like to continue this friendship, but I don't know how long it can truly continue like this. Thank you so much for your help in advance.  \n",
