      "Post Title  AITAH for skipping my sisters second wedding for the world cup content  Hi I m new to Reddit and this was a while ago but I was telling my family all year last year about me being able to see the world cup in person finally and they knew how much I wanted to go I was able to get ticket to see the game and apparently my sister s now second husband proposed to her 2 months before the wedding  I told her that I was going to have to miss the wedding because I was going to see the world cup final in person  she obviously got mad but her new husband said that he hasn t seen anything wrong with it because he knew how badly I wanted to go  I went to her first wedding with her first husband so  I didn t see anything wrong with what I did or the decision I made  I end up having a great time at the world cup final and I kind of don t regret anything  AITAH Comments  You already had plans  they rushed their plans and oddly was on the 1 day you couldn’t go  NTANTA   Might be an unpopular opinion     You already had plans everyone knew about   You invested a bunch of money I assume into going to the World Cup    Your new BIL said it’s okay 🤷🏻‍♀️I m sure your sister thinks you are but it s a second marriage and going to the world cup is something you ve wanted forever    NTA and glad you had a great time NTA   You made plans before she did NTA  If they got engaged two months before the wedding and long after you bought your holiday  then that s on them  I would point out that focusing on the wedding being a second wedding  even if she announced it with a giant waving red flag of a timeline  as a reason not to go is asshole ish and judgmental  but if you booked a once in a lifetime trip  presumably some amount of time far in advance  before the wedding was even conceived of  then you cannot be held responsible for missing the wedding  If you feel bad  a stunner of a wedding gift can smooth things over pretty fast NTA  You had plans   Her wedding was on short notice   It s not her first wedding   The list goes on   She knows how long you ve wanted to go   She wants to prioritize her twice in a lifetime to  your once in a lifetime NTA  Just promise that you’ll make it at her third wedding NTA…who plans a wedding in 2 months Nta you can go to her third wedding  If she cared she could have chosen literally any other dayNTA NTA you make plans first and tell everyone about your plans  She knows this before choose the date  Just tell her congratulations and send gift to newlyweds maybe buy some souvenir for them too NTA for sticking to your plan  but YTA for helping Qatar with their sports washing NTA  You’ve been to one wedding and no world cups and the money has been spent  I bet she didn’t even save any cake’NTA she knew you were going and didn’t account for you planning her wedding                            Post Title  AITA for being mad at my parents for ruining another birthday   TW  MENTIONS OF SELF HARM content  I 13f am the youngest child in the house and I always am overlooked or neglected or not taken seriously  I m uploading this here because I want to know if I am being a brat or not  Over the past few years my birthday has been constantly ruined  For example  on my 11th birthday my mom and dad had a huge fight over something stupid which led to a very awkward day  I had cried alot that day   On my 12th birthday I just wanted a simple cake because I knew that if I ask for more I d be labelled as a brat or spoilt ungrateful kid  my father got the cake flavour different then what I had asked for because of my mom s inlaws and my cousins  I couldn t eat that flavour because usually chocolate cakes are made out of dark chocolate which is extremely bitter to me  My mother replaced it a few days afterwards being very annoyed with me  This year I decided that I wanted a party for myself  I wanted to have the party a day before rather than on my birthday since I value my family and I d like to spend time with them as well  my mother and father were deciding where and what should my party be like when I had already decided that I d like me and my friends go out for a movie and after that a cafe  My mother was getting annoyed once again so I said it s okay and I ll settle for a cake again  and messaged my friends because I didn t want another fight to break out in the house  My mother got mad that I instantly messaged my friends about and she said that they would ve made the arrangements when I very well know it wasn t gonna be the way I wanted it and I would be upset at the end  my mother did shout at me for that and I did cry alot  fast forward to the day of my birthday  the first thing my mother said was  get off the phone before I kill you   I had to remind her that it was my birthday and then she wished me  In the morning my mother gave me a gift and said that it had costed alot when I very well knew that she got scammed because half of the products were damaged  She shot me an ungrateful look and ignored me the rest of the day which made me feel a bit sad and cause me to get my blade and cut myself    Idk what it is but I find relief in cutting myself and thinking about suicide just feels good   After that me and my family went out at a hotel for eating dinner  my sister was constantly on her phone  so was my mother  My father was watching the Cricket World Cup and I felt really alone  That was how my birthday went  and to gift myself something I asked if I could get a Polaroid camera  for which I have been saving up for and I have enough money  I am paying it from what I have saved and my mother is still refusing it  Overall I d say I had a bad birthday because whenever it is my sister s birthday  everything is perfect  no fights  no messing up in cake flavours  the whole family is United  etc  also the cake which I had gotten  I only got a slice of it because my dad thought about giving it to my cousins and the inlaws again  The cake was small as it is and my sister and father ate the rest of it and I got little to nothing  I just wonder why do they give one of their kids a perfect birthday and the other one a painful birthday Comments  NTA  You’re entitled to your feelings  You can’t always control how things make you feel  but you can control how you respond to these feelings  I strongly suggest that you talk to someone at school or a trusted adult about the cutting and thoughts of suicide  That’s a dangerous slope and can easily get out of hand very quickly  You matter  Your life has value  You have friends and other people in your life that care about you  Things will get better  but you need to stick around to see it NTA  Aw baby girl  you re only a baby still 😥Your parents are assholes  the best thing you can do is stay in school  save your money and move out asap  I was in your situation once  I m a 25F  when I was 13 I used to self harm also  I know you ll be thinking  don t lecture me  you don t understand  but trust me when I say this  It s not the answer  don t damage your body  it does get better  even if you have to move away and make a life for yourself  I self harmed and am covered in scars  I had to get tattoos all down my arms to cover my scars but still have big ones on my neck from when I tried ending my life  I have a 7 year old son now   when he asks me  mummy  what s that scar on your neck from  it takes me back   I wish I could go back and tell myself  it ll be okay one day   I promise it will  just hang in there  If you ever need support or someone to talk to you can message me NTA   However  as the youngest of four  stop expecting anything   If they offer say thank you   Open your presents and pretend to be happy in front of them   It sounds like you have friends so the get together for a movie and dessert after sounds fun   Get a part time job as soon as you are able  Finish high school  get into a trade  and GTFO of there                             Post Title  AITA for telling my husband his job as a stay at home dad is only easy because I help out content  I tried to post it on other subreddits but they keep removing it because my account is new  I am writing this from the guest bedroom because my husband and I had a fight  So  the thing is my husband is a stay at home dad  3 years ago he wanted to quit his job and take care of the house and children  6f and 2m   I work a decent job and earn most of the money  My husband takes pride in being a SAHD  He always brags about how it is the easiest job in this world and women are just complaining for no reason  But the truth is I help him with the chores as much as I can  In the morning I wake up and fix the breakfast for them  my husband gets our daughter ready for school  I also do meal preps for lunch  All he has to do is assemble them and cook it  I pack my and my daughter s lunch  When I am at work  he does the cleaning and spends time with our son or does his thing  Later when I come home  I cook the dinner and give my son a bath  help my daughter with her school work or I play with them for sometime until bed time  Besides that  whenever we do laundry I fold the clothes that he washes and put them away  And during deep cleaning of our house we split the tasks 50 50  I also handle all the doctors appointment   This system works really well but  I hate that he thinks my contribution is not enough  That he does all the chores and I do not even lift a finger  Moreover  he has a blog and tiktok where he films his days  He also makes posts about how easy it is to be a SAHD and women just complain and full of it  It is the easiest job in this world  I am glad he likes it but I hate he thinks he is superior to everyone and invalidating their experience  I grew up in a house where my dad didn t even lift a finger and my mom did literally everything around the house  He was the  fun  dad doing bare minimum  So  I do not want that to happen to my husband  Also it is my house too  I believe if both people do chores the stress becomes less  Also  I know many of my friends who struggle with doing chores as a SAHM  I also know women who work and still do majority of the chores  And his comments makes me irritated   SO  yesterday my friend Ashley came to visit  She is a mother of two  Her son probably has ADHD and very much active  she has trouble handling her son and gets no help from her husband  Her son breaks a cup in our house  Ashley was saying sorry  My husband cleaned it up and she was complaining how exhausted she is  My husband scoffed and told her  You must be doing the parent thing wrong because I am a stay at home parent too but I never had problem  My wife barely does anything around the house and it is so easy  Maybe I should give you a lesson or two   I can see Ashley was upset  I understand why  Later that day I told him what he said to Ashley was very rude  My husband acted as if he said nothing wrong and was honest  I pointed that he doesn t do all the chores  I help him with at least 40%  That s why he thinks it is easy  He again argued that those chores are not significant compared to what he does  I told him he is being mean to everyone  We got lucky that our kids are easy and not active  Most of the kids are hard to handle  He again scoffed and said how hard can it be   We argued about this and he told me I am being ungrateful because no man would ever sacrifice like he did  I am upset and gave him some space  Was I wrong to point it out   EDIT  Just want to point out  I have no issues of him being a SAHD  I just don t like his attitude towards it and the way he thinks it is the easiest job in this world because to me and most of the people it is still a job that has no vacation days Comments  Why are you okay with him putting down your contributions and devaluing you  Especially in front of your children  His attitude is a problem and your children are being exposed to this daily   YWBTA to yourself if you allow this to continue  Stop enabling him to put others down and stand up for yourself  Stop doing his job for him and let him step up  or as he is apparently telling others “doing everything around the house”    If he wants a chance to prove to everyone that being a SAHD is so easy then you should support him and give him that chance by letting him do what he claims to already have to do   which is everything It might be time for a week long  business  trip   Let him cope 24 7 and see if it s really so easy I was a stay at home Mom  My children are now adults   I did all of the household chores  laundry  cooking and cleaning   I did all of the yard work  We had an acre  I volunteered in their schools and music programs  That often took 30 hours a week  My husband did story time and often took care of bed time  I considered the household tasks to be my  job   I wouldn t have dreamt of telling someone else how they were  doing it wrong   What an entitled and terribly rude comment   And he has a blog to tell strangers how to better manage their time  He doesn t even cook dinner for heaven s sake  Please NTA    He sounds exhausting and unaware of how self centered he is  Parenting isn’t a competition between him and you  It’s a team sport where you both have to participate  Sounds like you are doing more in context  in the home and outside the home   Love seeing a SAHD but he needs a swift kick in the @ss for being full of himself  not valuing your contributions and his misogynistic comments    Stop doing what you’re doing and let him truly be a SAHD   NTA I ve worked jobs with big OT  and I ve been a SAHD for a while now  and it s as much a full time job as any other  Worse  even  since you re never really  off the clock   And days where I get bogged down fixing something or doing annual maintenance on the house or the like  it can be exhausting to catch back up on regular  daily chores like dishes while the baby is demanding a bottle  a kid needs put to bed  and all my daylight is already gone     If my wife helps out with the laundry or something  you can count on my noticing and appreciating it  Sounds like your husband is being spoiled by you and doesn t even realize it     Honestly  maybe you  should  be a bit on an AH about this  Don t help out at all for a few weeks  but keep asking why things aren t done  He ll figure it out Tell him that you two are going to take a week and write down what you each do around the house  Get notebooks and do just that  Make note of EVERYTHING  including work  Then compare lists at the end of the week   It s really the only way either of you will understand what the work load is of the other Wow   your husband is an entitled spoiled princess    You do ALL the money earning and 40% of the actual household labor as well     Stop helping him     If he thinks it s such a sacrifice tell him to get his ass back in the job market and you ll be a stay at home mom and you expect him to contribute doing EXACTLY what you do now   OR since he thinks your contribution is so minor    stop doing it He’s not a stay at home dad… you have an unemployed husband OP  this is a serious suggestion  Stop doing what you re doing to contribute to the household for a week  Not to be petty  but to show your husband what a SAHP usually goes through if their partner doesn’t help  He needs that wake up call  Desperately  Could be a humbling experience for him and get him off his high horse NTA    I automatically think anyone who has a blog based around shaming spouses as the automatic ahole  No matter the gender or reasonIf what you do isn t significant  he shouldn t have any problem whatsoever taking it over  Drop the rope  For a week  don t make breakfast  don t meal prep  don t cook dinner  don t fold laundry  don t clean  nothing  You take care of the financials and then spend time with your kids  See if he doesn t change his tune NTA but you are being to yourself     Wait so you earn the money then the moment you wake up you fix breakfast for everyone and prep lunch all before getting ready to rush out the door  Then the moment you’re home you cook diner and then occupy and care for the kids  When do you get a rest from the minute your awake or home it’s you doing everything  The only time you get a break it’s not a break as your working to support everyone      Sorry but he isn’t a stay at home dad he just ensures your children don’t do anything stupid in the day  You are doing far more than him and it seems he gets far more down time and less stress than you who works and does 50% of parenting     Show him what a stay at home parent is  Do not do any of the meals or chores as that’s his contribution along with caring for the kids  Then take turns putting the children to bed but ensure you get time to yourself to decompress after work without being the one in charge of the kids  Do this for at least two weeks until he learns you do far more in every way than him  Hopefully he will realise he’s been an ass otherwise you married an asshole and that reflects on you as well  Others definitely judge you by who you associate with and it’s more so when your married to them So if you really do  nothing  around the house    sounds like you should literally be doing nothing right    hint hint    NTA and show him what doing nothing around the house really looks likeMy concern is his “sacrificing”  What exactly does that mean  Weren’t they choices  So he has “sacrificed” what  There seems to be some underlying issues for him around his role and the need to feel “superior” in this role  I am one for therapy because it could be helpful for him and you in flushing out the issues with going against cultural gender roles  Shame is a sinister emotion that sometimes masks itself NTA  He is deeply conflicted  On the one hand  it s so easy and why are women complaining  On the other hand  no man would ever sacrifice like he did  It s very contradictory and somewhat narcissistic  Even a bit toxic  Just make sure you are taking care of yourself  No man would ever sacrifice like he did   Really  What is he sacrificing exactly    He wanted to be a SAHD and that s what he got  He clearly has a superiority complex  which honestly  outside of chronic lying  is one of the most exhausting personality traits to be around     Here s my favourite put down  courtesy of my late wee mum     self praise is no recommendation    My next favourite  from a book  who s trumpeter died    You ll get loads of advice telling you to stop doing breakfast  stop doing the 40% etc    But the real issue for you doesn t seem to be how much you do  but his dismissal of your contribution  on top of a full time job that sustains your family    Your husband sounds unbearably smug by your description  Maybe that s something you don t mind too much  or you can deal with it because he s great in every other respect  It takes all sorts  This self glorifying behaviour would give me the major ick tbh     NTA but I don t think you ll get through to him that he is wrong to speak to your friend like that and wrong to minimise what you do for your family Wow  NTA  I was a SAHM for 5 ish  years    Well  I also babysat neighborhood kids to earn extra money  but still  I was home and did 99% of the childcare and house management  in addition to handling the finances  My husband drives for UPS  so aside from the weekends he didn t do a ton to help   not because he didn t want to  but because he really couldn t  He was typically gone 8a 8p M F and even later during peak holiday season  But he would help when he could  like folding and putting away laundry  doing the dishes after dinner and since he was usually a much better cleaner  in his opinion  he would clean the whole house once a week  lol  I used to clean up on Fridays  but he would always go behind me when he got home  so I just stopped and let him have at it  Nowadays though  he s lightened up a bit and since I work from home  I am back to cleaning on Fridays  One of my biggest things back then was that I NEEDED to get of the house for some alone time  so I went grocery shopping alone on Sundays  Like  got up early  went by Starbucks and hit up the grocery stores  I was also couponing back then  so sometimes I d go to 2 or 3 stores and would be gone for like 3  hours     So  even though he wasn t able to do a LOT on the day to day to help  he was   extremely   supportive in any way he could be  He encouraged me to take time to myself  he wanted me to get out of the house when he was home or he d take the kids up to the local arcade so I could be home alone  whatever  And yeah  being the primary caregiver was still hard a lot of the time  probably more so in my case because I was watching other kids  I couldn t get out of the house very much at all  especially not join mommy me groups with a minivan full of kids  and I doubt the parents would ve wanted me to take their kids all over the place  but I couldn t have done what I did without his support and your husband can t do what he does without your support and the fact that he finds being a SAHP so easy  if he truly does    IS BECAUSE   he has your support and he needs to check himself and realize that because he s being an AH by not recognizing your contribution to the family dynamics I was a SAHM for years  Why are you doing so much  And I m not talking about weekends when everybody s home and things are more even  Let him be a real SAHP and do more so maybe he will stop saying AND POSTING those terribly discouraging things to people who actually do a lot more than him  NTA NTA   My husband and I have the exact same arrangement  and he acknowledges how much my contribution helps make his life easier and is grateful  and I acknowledge how much he helps me and am grateful   If I were you I d stop helping with the chores at the very least  just to show him how much you actually do help outNTA  but stop and I mean STOP helping him around the house   He sounds self centered and a little toxic   He thinks he can do it all  then let him and see what he thinks when it all goes south NTA…  He’s barely even doing half of what most stay at home parents do and he has the gall to brag about how great he is   I got a suggestion  Stop helping out  Just make yourself coffee in the morning  go to work  And come back  sit down  and play around on your phone  Let him see just how hard it actually is I don t follow his logic  In your last paragraph he said that  no man would make a sacrifice  like he did  but yet he routinely talks about how easy it is  I mean  those are very contradictory thoughts    I also can t believe a person could be so smug and arrogant to talk down to another parent  your friend   I almost want to assume your husband has aspergers or something and the condescension is not intentional  but that s me just trying to make sense out it and not think he is an ass   Again  I feel like maybe I am giving him some benefit of the doubt that he doesn t deserve  but maybe he s so clueless that he doesn t realize how much you do  So stop doing it for a week or two and see what happens  perhaps NTA  Stop doing any chores  Seeing as your chores are “insignificant” it shouldn’t matter that you don’t do them Soooo    Time to let him feel the full weight of a SAHD  Let him do all of it and see what he thinks   The truth is  the division of household labor for most SAHM is about 90% on them  Few men lift more than a finger   obviously there are exceptions  and to those men  I salute you  on TOP of that  men actually contribute MORE work for stay at home moms than single mothers have to do   Extra dishes  extra laundry  extra cooking  etc    Maybe supply him some reading material  ie  studies that have proven this  There are many You make TWO of the three meals a day and prep the third   While working  And still do other chores around the house  He s not a stay at home dad  He s unemployed and watches your toddler while you re at work  I work from home and do more than he does    NTA Stop getting up and organising things in the morning  stop cooking tea at night  do what most men do whose wives are SAHM’s  My husband stayed home with the kids while I went back to work  he organised the kids breakfast  got them organised for school  did the washing and the majority of the housework and cooked dinner every night  I did the dishes  bathed the kids  spent quality time with them etc  Weekends  we shared the load NTA  but stop helping for a week   let him actually see how hard it is without your help Nta every time he says something rude respond with  you only think it is easy because I do so much of the work at home  if you really did everything a stay at home parent does you wouldn t think it was easy    I m not generally a fan of putting your partner down in front of others but if he is putting down others and denigrating your work I don t think it is wrong to set the record straight in the moment even if that s public Stop doing any of the chores you do for a month  Let him have the full over worked sahp experience  Then see what his tune sounds like  Otherwise nta opNTA   your husband sucks  He is blind to all the things you do for him and your family  and he also has no self awareness about his behaviour  He needs to get a reality check    Maby he s so arrogant because the tiktok likes and comments and sees his little social media world as reality Stop helping and let him figure it out NTA  Since your contribution is so minuscule  tell him you’re leaving those chores in his capable hands  Breakfast  baths  laundry  the whole shebang  Maybe he’ll start appreciating what he has because struggling moms would love to have husbands as supportive and hands on as you are Time to stop making breakfast and he can get his ass out of bed and start doing it   You tell him the cook has quit  since he is so good at the SAHD stuff  he can take on more responsibility Offer him a challenge  you get a list from Ashley of exactly everything her husband does for parenting  housework  and their marriage on an average day week  You follow that list to a T for one or two weeks NTA  You should make your actions fit his description  Don t lift a finger around the house for a couple of weeks  Start your own TikTok channel and film the mess while you comment on it  Send him the link NTA   Stop doing 40% and let him pick up the slack since he s a professional NTA but OP  FOR REAL  stop what you’re doing to “help him” and just allow everything to collapse around you  It’s the only way he’ll learn   This is the only wayPerhaps it s time OP goes on a  work  retreat or vacation or whatever  for say a week  I m sure that would be an eye opening experience for such a great SAHD   NTAHNTA  I read an article saying that according to studies SAHD have about 20 hrs of leisure time vs SAHM who have 7hr  Working mom s have 4hr and working dad s about 10  The reason SAHD s have so much free time is that working women still do A LOT of housework and kid raising vs working dad s  Those are facts not feelings so he can  Take his TikTok and shove it  Also my son never sits down and always wants to play vs step daughter who can entertain herself for hours  Kids are different so just cause y all s kids are easy doesn t mean other people have same kids    Edit to say  stop doing all the stuff he claims you aren t doing anyway and see how fun his TikTok will be then I think you need to go on strike  Opt out  Ask him to really do it all  See if it s still easy   If it s not  your contributions will be ackowledged and appreciated  If it is easy  let him do it all NTA but you need to back away and let him see how much work he ISN T doing  Give it a month  Act just like a 1950s dad and just come home  ask where is dinner then go to the den and watch TV  for a solid month  No bathing kids   No cooking  no cleaning  no folding laundry  no anything helpful  I know this will be uncomfortable for you but he is being patronizing to SAHMs everywhere and it s time he has a wake up call  Good luck NTA and he was super rude to Ashley    You should have spoken up about everything you do while Ashley was standing there    He mad her feel terrible and he’s an egotistical AH  Maybe if all SAHM had the same help from their partners as you give HIM as a SAHD had  it WOULD be easier  Sounds like if he would wake up about how much you do  it would be a pretty nice division of labor  Maybe you should act like a dude for a week  see if it changes his mind Let him do everything in tbe house for a few months and see if he complains   even the appoints  he should do them as well   You just get home from your work and relax NTA but you need to stop doing so much so he understands what being a SAHP actually means  You re working full time plus doing  by the sounds of it  a huge proportion of the household chores  that isn t fair  Part of being a SAHP is doing a larger chunk of the household chores OP is this your husband   https   www reddit com r TrueUnpopularOpinion comments 150t8pw being  a  stay  at  home  parent  is  easy NTA and maybe you should stop doing your 40% and let him be a TRUE SAHD and do 100% of the job so he can see what it s really like   No one likes a know it all and it really seems like that s what he is   Make him do the full job and see where he is then NTA  From what I read YOU do actually most of the chores  Stop immediately  because what would ne the problem for him if you stop with doing  insignificant thing  or  barely anything   Let him find out what SAHP really means to most others Leave him with the kids and go out of town for two full weeks  I think we can almost guarantee his attitude will change Most working parents don’t come home and help out the stay at home parent… stop doing it  When dinner isn’t on the table complain about it  If there are any messes  dishes in the sink  laundry not done  etc  ask why it’s not done  Don’t do bath time etc  see how easy he thinks it is in a week or soI second what everyone else has said  He doesn t think being a SAHD is hard  Then you do what a  typical traditional  working parent would do instead of what you have been  Tell him outright that is what you ll be doing    You don t help with breakfast  as typically the working parent does not help with that  He will be on his own for lunch  dinner  laundry  He will be expected to do ALL the household chores  as you are sooooo busy at work   Everything child related is his  including all appointments or anything else  🤷‍♀️  You get to come home from work  First  you relax  as most working parents with a stay at home  unwind  before doing anything child related   Play with the kids  Maybe help with homework  You don t help cook or clean up dinner  Bare minimum at bedtime    That is the unfortunate truth behind what a lot of SAHM are going through and he needs to understand that    Game ends when he admits your help and contribution is appreciated and enough   And maybe when apologizes to Ashley  if you re feeling petty     Or maybe he ends up fine with the new status quo and you get to relax more  Win win    NTANTA  But telling him is not going to do it  Tell him that because of what he said  you re going to let him do everything from now until he admits how much you are contributing  Tell him you re going to do what your father did  and let him do what your mother did  Then follow through   Feel free to go out for drinks with your friends after work  too  And  take over  for the kids only exactly how much you feel like it  to maintain your relationship with them and to have fun  See how long it takes for him to cry uncle NTA   you re enabling ur husband to be a POS   The moment that my partner starts to talk smack  I would easily stop helping for a week so they can have a good idea on what a stay at home dad wife really does    Then I would continue after a week to show the difference in workload    Please stop enabling ur husband to be a dumb shitStop helping for a week and see how it goes  Then when he actually understands what your contribution has been talk to him about it and divide the labor so it’s more equitable    NTAI ve been the working parent  and i ve been a full time single parent  I ve never been a SAHD     When I was a working parent  I did similar to what you have outlined  took care of breakfast and getting kids ready  handed off responsibility and went to work  took over when I got home  made dinner  did bath time and bed  picked up after   Hard but rewarding  but I never got any credit for what I did  I don t know what it is about it  but people seem to think the 10 hours you spend working are a vacation from it all and all the empathy is directed toward SAH parents     So  hubby needs empathy     NTAGreat for your husband being proud of being a SAHD  But what a crappy attitude  There is no reason to put down anyone s efforts as a stay at home parent  and certainly acting as if women just complain is petty and nasty of him  Treating Ashley with disregard for her situation is a huge flashing neon sign above your husband s head  and it is flashing  YTA    It sounds as if he might be trying to boost himself up by putting others down because there is something insecure in him   HTA Stop helping with chores  Perhaps continue with cooking  for the childrens  sake  but if  your chores  are so trivial  he should have no problem taking them on as well  Maintain that position until he stops being insufferable about being a SAHD I do the same in my household  I don’t understand why people think only one person is responsible for everything in the house hold  I get off work and do the nighttime routine   one because I haven’t seen my baby girl all day 2  I know my wife has been at home all day with a toddler  It’s my house too just because I work don’t mean I get to neglect my household responsibilities  If my wife feels I need to do more around the house I genuinely encourage her to say something to me  Stay at home parenting is a job within itself and a successful house hood need the parents to work in tandem to get things done  That’s just my opinion  Is she cooks I wash dishes  If she cleans the bathrooms I do laundry  Idk I just think a family is a team effort and and if one side thinks life is too easy then that person may not be doing enough   Then again speaking from my own personal experience in my household men and women seem to handle the same stress completely different  She gets overwhelmed way way way before I do    NTATell him for the next week you’re going to show him how much you do around the house by not doing it  Then don’t  NTA  He wants to be an ass about it  He can earn being an ass about itI retired a couple of years ago  and my wife was still working  I did about 90% of the housework   I cooked  cleaned  laundry  you name it  She ordered groceries  and I picked them up  She helped out some  but nothing like you are   Of course your husband says it is easy  you are doing 3 4ths of the work   Perhaps he should get up early and make breakfast for everyone  and then dinner in the evening   Then laundry and make sure the house is clean so when you come home you have time to relax with the children   Sorry  but your husband is lazy  and it is ridiculous for you to be doing so much Go on strike  Take a week  Work  go home  play with your kids  go to bed  Do NO chores  Won t be long and I GUARANTEE you his tune will change NTA  He finds being a SAHP easy because he has a  wife    For the next week  you should try being a husband  I e  do only what Ashley s husband does  When he complains  tell him he must be doing something wrong NTA  He sounds insecure af  He knows he couldn t make it in the labour market and wants to make himself feel better by downplaying other people s effortsWell  NTA for pointing it out  He was extremely rude    But YTA for allowing him to think it’s easy to be a stay at home parent  As a SAHM  I am really offended that you have created the impression in him that it’s just a walk in the park  He blogs  posts  and puts out TikToks on how easy it is  Do you realize the harm he is doing to SAH parents  especially moms   He’s now another voice of toxic masculinity    Your husband is still like your dad   both doing the bare minimum  You need to back off and let him experience what most SAHMs face  He needs to know the real experience  Ashley has the real experience  Your husband is play acting    You know  one day one  or both  of your children might be a SAHP  How do you think your husband is going to treat her him if s he should say how hard it is  The same way he treated Ashley NTA  I’m currently a SAHM who says that it isn’t a very hard job   Mentally draining  yes  sometimes   It’s not “easy ” but it’s not as hard as working outside the home   I’ve gotten my head bitten off many a time on Reddit for saying so     All of that is to say  even I think your husband is WRONG   It is much harder than HE thinks it is   He is not doing nearly all of the duties that a “typical” stay at home parent does   You are doing far more than most stay at home parents would expect from their partners  and still he says it’s not enough   If you stopped doing what you’re doing  your husband would be begging for mercy  guaranteed   He’s putting on a show for his fans online and they’re feeding his ego and it’s pathetic   Stop “helping” him for a week and see what happens   Or make your own online show that’s like a reaction video to his showing what actually goes on LOLStop feeding your family immediately  He isn t doing shit if he s not feeding all of you  You re doing too much  Make your labor visible and stop doing it immediately  I ve got some fun video games I can recommend  or you should go get drinks after work  Leave a mess and don t clean it up  Scroll through this and manifest the worst of our husbands  Punish your husband for all of the transgressions of ours  Destroy the pedestal he s placed himself on  for the love of all that is good and pure on God s pink earth Stop packing lunches and let him figure out the cooking  baths  and chores  and see how he fares  Make up a work happy hour  take a weekly class  shouldn t be a problem because he has it all under control right  Your husband sounds insufferable  and I would have been so embarrassed if my husband talked to my friends like that  Hopefully you ve conveyed to your friend you don t share his views on parenthood  He really owes her an apology NTA   Sacrifice like he did  ROTFLMAO  If it’s really as easy as he says  it was no sacrifice for him  He can’t have it both ways   You might want to stop doing any of the chores you’re doing for a week or so  Then he’ll see just how much of the slack you’re picking up for him   Furthermore  he’s being just plain obnoxious about it all Stop doing them for a week and see if he loses the blinders  NTA  I was a SAHM and would have killed for the amount of help you happily provide  he told me I am being ungrateful because no man would ever sacrifice like he did    woooooo what an asshole this guy is   A bunch of guys would pull their actual weight as SAHD and not dump shit on their breadwinning partners while mocking them online I m speechless  Why are you doing his job  He s so disrespectful  Stop helping him and let him know how a SAHD should be  I hate how he bragging and saying it s an easy job  such misogynistic  NTA if you stop doing half the chores  YTA if you keep enabling his behaviour He doesn’t know how easy it has been for him with YOUR help  Take some time off  like a week and that will teach him a lesson Just stop doing your chores because basically from the sound of it   You do more then a man woman who is working   So be the “man”  Take 40 minute shits four times a day Don’t meal prep Don’t do bathtime   Give him a real taste of majority of what women go throughNTA  Your husband’s behavior makes me think he’s very insecure about his role in your marriage   He is playing up how good he is at everything for attention  “Look at me  I’m better than all of you women complaining about how hard it is ”  It sounds like he needs therapy and to stop harassing people online and in person about their lives NTA  But if you are earning 100% of the money  and he is earning 0%  how does he make that math line up in terms of your contributions to parenting and house chores  when you re still doing 40 50% of all that     If he doesn t think it s  all that difficult  then he should be doing 100% of the meals and house chores  and you help with parenting as you can when you re off work   You re putting in almost the same chores and child rearing as he is  but every single bit of the breadwinning too     And he made  sacrifices    Which is it   Is it a sacrifice or is it super easy   Either way  he s a huge AH for invalidating other people based on just his own experiences  and he needs a huge reality check Sounds like a weird version of toxic masculinity   like  this is so easy  I don t know what all these stupid women are complaining about    In sure his followers and subscribers eat it up   The solution would be to stop meal prepping and cleaning and see how easy he thinks it is  maybe It is   easy   for him because he s only part timing it   OP is pitching in an awful lot for him to be complaining about anything   Definitely NTA NTA  I just heard the statistics on amount of household work men do in a relationship and the only group where men do 50% is stay at home dads  He is doing less household work than your friend nta  stop helping him  let him do it all on his own  let him learn how hard it is to truly be on his own  even if it s still easy for him  he didn t have to go through the hormone and body changes of having kids so ofc his mental state would be cleared than someone who pushed a x lb baby out Your husband is shitting on mothers to make himself feel superior  You re married to an asshole who doesn t appreciate or respect you  Stop doing chores and let him do it all for a change  NTANTA  Your husband is enjoying staying home and essentially playing all day while you scurry around doing stuff so he can convince himself how superior he is at this whole stay at home thing   From what you’ve described your doing way more than 40%   He’s got a great gig going   Stop enabling him Folding and putting away the laundry is 75% of doing laundry  It’s the worst part    Stop helping for a week  NTA   Editing to add Make him go grocery shopping and make dinner for a week  Men seems to be befuddled by grocery stores NTA  No offense  but he sounds more like a glorified babysitter than a stay at home dad  It s easy for him because you made it easy for him  Sacrificed  Sound like he didn t sacrifice shit  I promise if you switched roles  you d be doing a ton more as a SAHM than he does as a SAHDWow…  NTA  but your husband is  His misogynistic attitude sucks     Not only is he’s downplaying the work women do in general  but even more so   He is not honoring you   Your contributions are the  the reason his job is easy  You already know how hard the job is  You are making sure he doesn’t suffer from burn out  depression and the plethora of issues women face trying to manage their home lives  regardless of if they are SAHM’s or Working outside the home too   Not only is it unpaid work  it never effing ends  Zero days off    OP  let this man eat his words  please  If being a SAHP is half as easy as he says he is in his TikTok’s or blogs   he wouldn’t have time for either if he got a reality check You are NTA    Ive been a SAHH husband  two times in my life  The first with two kids at home under the age of 5  The second in our 50’s with no kids at home but living in a new country    Your husband is the AH  It is an incredibly hard job without a spouse helping out  I like the idea of telling your husband”I am not helping for two weeks ” Let him see how hard it really is   I will say my 2nd go around is not physically hard it is mentally and emotionally hard  😀If he rhinks it is so easy stop helping him and see how long he lasts  This is a ridiculous situation  Sounds like youre a single working mother to 3 hereGive him the list of what actually is required of him  just once  he is superior   s  then stand back in awe of his skills and energy  And then see how long his cocky attitude lasts   SAH means you do it all  so your partner can focus on  the tasks they have to perform   Good luck OPIf not be lifting a finger for the next month  He s the SAHD  he can do itI m a SAHM with 3 kids and 2 dogs and I would never tell somebody else  they re doing it wrong  because of my situation  Being a SAHM isn t easy and your husband doesn t realize that because you re carrying so much of the load FOR HIM    Stop doing that    He wants to claim its easy  Cool  Let him try and pack lunches  while making breakfast  while trying to get both kids dressed  while trying to calm the 2yo s tantrum because he can t put his socks over his shoes  while answering the 10th question in a row from the 6yo  while trying to drink his coffee while it s still hot AND find the keys to take the kids to school while thinking of a dinner menu  You know  normal SAHP things    Being a parent  even without staying home  is a juggling act and it s easier with a partner that carries their weight  In this situation  you re helping him more than he knows and he s taking all the credit  Not cool  Not a helpful partner  😒You should start acting like a man who has a job  You get up and you expect the breakfast to be ready on the table or least the coffee all ready for you    When you get home  go take off your work clothes and just head to the living room and sit  If a child approaches you then you play a little until you tell them  go bother you father for a little bit  I m really tired today     Then if you husband requests some help  just say that it was really hard today at work and you are really tired  Emphasize that you will help next time  but actually never do it   The other option is to tell him  in a little bit  but never get up to do it    Act like this for about a week and ask him again if being a SAHD is really easy and women just complain for now reason   NTANta  He sounds unemployed rather than a sahd He s not a SAHD  he s a glorified babysitter  Sounds to me like he needs to get a job and pull his weight because he s bumming off you and you re letting it happen  I speak from many unfortunate years of experience  Don t make my mistake  NTAStop what your doing tell him your job requires more of your time and let him take the reins see how he feels after thatDivorce his ass   Your husband literally has social media dedicated to demeaning women Nta  Stop helping out and let him handle everything  The house the kids  Cleaning  Cooking  I would plan a week vacation by yourself and just let him handle everything  Or be honest “according to you I don’t help out at home in anyway  So I’m going to stop helping  Child like such things for breakfast  Just a heads up I will be at home at this time so you know about what time to have dinner done ” Don’t prep don’t go food shopping  Get home and go straight to the room  Anything your kids need tell them to go tell dad  And just remind him  Don’t forget to shower little one  Maybe if he has to do what he has been doing plus everything you have to do he will see how lucky he is that you just do part of the chores and child caring without him ever having to ask  Being a stay at home parent isn’t easy it’s only easy because your making it easy  So stop making it easy NTA  stop helping him out and see how he likes it and think what you do is so easy 😊Why why why are you even with him   He’s so immature and rather a narc  it’s fucking ridiculous     I say this because my mother was EXACTLY like this and there was always more to it NTA from your telling   But I d like to hear his side of the story NTA and I would suggest you do the BARE MINIMUM for one  month then see if he sings a different tune   e g  help a little bit in the a m  when the kids are eating b’fast and if you are making your own lunch and it’s easy to make daughters go ahead  the rest is in him to provide a healthy nutritious dinner  make then take to dr appts     and if he continues to think it’s a breeze  great but  he needs to STFU around other sahm sahd and you NTA  Take a break from your chores for a bit and see if he’s still saying it’s super easyIt’s time for you to stop helping him with chores and act like your dad used to…and explain that is the reality of most stay at home parents  After he complains about the work he’s doing on his own  then you can go back o a normal balanced relationship   NTA NTA stop helping him for a week  He can cook dinner  He can do laundry fully and clean  Come home help with homework  baths and play with you kids  He is responsible for everything else  He needs to prep lunches  yours included at night or get up and do it  You can get your daughter dressed ready for school which is still helping a lot  Tell him what you will do since your contributions are meaningless  Also since it’s no big deal he can watch the hyper kid for a couple hours one day NTA  Make a list of all the chores that you are doing  which he has deemed as insignificant       Note the ones that you will keep  Ex if he is capable of cooking meals then your could consider doing dishes or vice versa     From now on as a SAHM dad with plenty of time on his hands as it so easy a job he can now add all of those you didn’t keep to his list which are all things most SAHMs do   Then leave him to it    If you do this please provide an update on how things go At first it just seemed like your husband had a slight misrepresentation of responsibilities between you guys  But as i kept reading i see he definitely has an inflated ego about it  Im glad he feels pride about being able to be with his children  but that pride should be about his joy over being of service and being involved with his children in a way he otherwise would not be able to   Id say he definitely needs a reality check  He should appreciate all the things you do because hes thankful that you are a caring provider  mother  and wife   In a non petty way  you should stop being as helpful around the house communicate this  so that he may come to an understanding that all those things you do to help add up  and take more time and effort than he thinks they do NTA   Stop doing those insignificant chores  that s all NTA your husband needs a lesson on empathy at the very least  I also think you should stop contributing and let him truly be a stay at home parent  He’s acting like a doosh NTA and I think it’s time for you to “do nothing” like he claims for about 2 weeks   If he doesn’t apologize  congrats  you get to be fun dad NTA    He’s a lot  huh    Stop helping and see how he deals STOP  HELPING  HIM   And then he ll know NTA  Inform him you will not be helping with the household chores  including breakfast  lunch prep and dinner for the next month so he can see just how much your normal contribution is worth    You are paying all the bills  Tell him you will happily continue your evening activities with the kids  that s parenting  beginning when you get home from work  so he can make dinner   At the end of the month  the two of you can re evaluate    Then do it NTA  I recommend you go on strike  dear     As your husband seems to have it so  easy   I suggest leaving all the household chores to your very competent husband   Let him make breakfast  do all the meal prep and cleanup  the laundry  getting the kids ready for school   all of it   You are the breadwinner and as such  you should dial back your contributions at home so that your husband will learn to appreciate the assistance you provide him in managing your household   I was a SAHM for awhile with our three kids before I went to college and began my long career  There was a time after I started working where I was putting in a bucketload of work managing our home and my job   I needed some cooperation at home and wasn t getting enough  so I just quit cooking and cleaning     Of course this upset my husband which was my intention   My husband likes order and I can be quite comfortable with clutter and a little mess   Three grade schoolers can use a lot of dishes  spill juice  slop jelly across a counter   and track in all kinds of stuff into the house  let alone leave their things where they don t belong   Legos in the livingroom carpet    If your husband enjoys bragging about how easy his work is then a    you re overworking yourself and b   you need to give him plenty more to brag about Give him the full social   mental load too  Buying for birthdays  Christmas  setting up Easter  all holidays too  Making the food  and handling the invites  Let him see how well he handles it NTA stop doing chores and helping out and see how easy he thinks it is thenNTA   he’s the AH not you  he sounds so self centered    You should really just stop doing whatever chores you do or anything house related and let him handle it alone at least for a week to shut him upStop doing anything at all in the house ASAP and reel him back into reality Time for a little out of town vacation on your own  OP Keep us updated after you decide to not help him and see if it’s still “the easiest job in the world”  Stop doing at the helpful things  for like a week or two  Let him see what it s really like  Fk him and his attitudeNTA   But    I am totally going to be keeping my eyes open for an update  Your husband seems really mean  and it sounds as if you are doing a ton of the work  I am curious to see what happens if you decide to let him do it all NTA  Stop doing anything for a week  Just take care of yourself  and obviously if the kids need something  but care minimum  no more If he doesn t notice what you have been doing he ll definitely notice when you don t do it   STRIKE   Stop helping him  so he gets quickly hit by the reality 😈I need an Update hereIf they re not significant and his job is so easy  then he should have no problem taking on the insignificant chores you do      Note the time and date be said that    And stop helping until he admits he was wrong NTA  Stop helping with anything  Let him do it all by himself for a week or so and see if he’s singing a different song Stop helping for a month  See what he says then Please show him this post so he has a wake up call  What an absolute moron I would just do what he says you are doing now and let him really do all the work  Or maybe you should go to marriage counseling because I have been divorced twice and shouldnt be handing out marital advice  Either way NTA NTA  stop doing anything to help him for a week   $10 he cracks and starts asking for help    I get very lucky that my husband helps as much as he does and works   Right now he’s away on a work trip and shit has hit the fan here at home and I can’t wait for him to be home so I can have some help   Being  Stay at home parent is not easy    He’s being a jerkSo   he thinks you don t lift a finger  Stop lifting a finger  Let stay at home dad figure it all out on his own while you just focus on your job and playing with the kids NTA tell him that he’s passed his probation and is now equipped to be a proper SAHD  And let him do everything  Only let up when he gives Ashley a formal apology  His ego is going to bite hard but don’t back down else you will be setting a bad example for your children  You never know he might still be awesome and then you both win  But his arrogance is unattractivePlease just actually let him do the work for a month or month and a half  All of it  breakfast  folding laundry  appointments  baths   then make a follow up post about how he experienced that lol  He sounds like a douchebag Why do you keep doing stuff   He says he can do it all   Let him Well since he thinks your 40% participation of chores   zero effort I vote you scale your chore actual chores effort down to zero  and focus your new time and energy into… sleep  a new hobby  a class  joining a gym class  a new book you’ve been waiting to read or anything you’ve been putting off to prioritize helping him since he’s apparently got this situation well in hand   Maybe he will end up missing your efforts after all and decide to apologize to you and your friend Stop helping him with chorea and lunches  That s part of the stahd job  So let him do everything that you have been doing and he ll see he s being a dick then leave himNTA If it s so easy he can do it all  Give him a real taste of what a lot of other stay at home spouses experience  Sit him down and say  right you ve said that my contribution is so insignificant that I am going to stop contributing to any house hold chores and will do no more than play with the kids when I get home for the next 30 days  This way you can experience what Ashley and a lot of other spouses experience  No discussion   See how long it takes him to realise  The only stuff I would do is stuff so that the kids aren t affected too much  I am petty so I also wouldn t stop until he puts out an apology posts Girl 40% is lowballing it 😅 with that chores list you’re doing 75% of the housework on a good day   Sit down with your husband and write out a list of all the household chores  Then give him at LEAST 75% of them  and leave it at that  Until then  he’s not a stay at home parent  he’s just a parent with no job STOP DOING ANY CHORES  Let him see what happens Wtf    Stop doing morning chores and making dinner  If he is the parent at home  tell him that that falls under his category    Your husband sounds like a sanctimonious  arrogant twatwaffle    Seriously  stop doing some things  When your daughter breaks up for summer hols and your husband has a breakdown  make sure to tell him  he s doing it wrong    Edit  you suck for letting him disrespect and put your friend down NTA  Check out the book Fair Play by Eve Rodsky Just stop what you are doing for a few weeks  See how he likes it then  This man is mean  Make him do the actual work then      x200B   NTA  Your husband needs a taste of his own medicine  If what you do is not really a contribution     stop contributing  He ll eat his words NTA  But start with letting him do all the work  He doesn t appreciate you and your contribution to the household  And he was extremely rude to your friend Stop helping him  That will be the easiest way for him to figure it out YTA for letting him run his mouth like diarrhea  Please for the sake of all sahms Stop all of your contributions except playtime  U must give him the full experience for at least one week  It s the only way STOP helping him immediately  even go away for a week or two  or a month if you have to  perhaps just leave him completely  As long as you keep picking up the slack he will never appreciate you   He is toxic  and a manchild with a severe lack of responsibility it seems So    stop doing the  insignificant  things you contribute and see how  easy  it is then    I d consider asking him what he thinks you do and if the list is less than what you ve detailed  do only what he says you do until he realises you do more  Or maybe just cut out everything and act like the  fun parent  for a while until he realises that you have been making his job so much easier than he thinks   You are NTA  Your husband certainly is NTA Wow  Just wow  He sounds like a piece of work  Please stop doing stuff for him  He wants to be a sahd  let him  Also having a kid who goes to school and one that stays home is much different than having two plus kids at home all day  My husband is a sahd and we have two energy sapping kids and he would definitely disagree with your husband  Especially since the kids have been with him non stop over the summer Sounds like a Stay At Home DoucheNTA  I’m a SAHD and it’s exhausting  My wife plans the meals  but I do all the cooking  cleaning  laundry  Dr appointments  ferrying the kids to activities  When she’s away on business trips it’s easier in that I just order pizza or make chicken tenders instead of actually cooking… but it’s more tiring because I’m directly involved with every little issue the kids have and one kid has ADHD  so I definitely empathize with your friend  I say take two days off from helping your husband and see how he does  He’s delusional and doesn’t appreciate you NTA except to yourself    As he already claims you do nearly nothing  do nothing for a month or so  Inform him upfront  that starting Monday you will jot lunch prep  prep breakfast    because it s anyway nothing   The warning is  so that the children don t suffer  He needs to eat dirt    You will only return to the former routine if he apologizes to you  your friend  and publicly on his tiktok I’m a petty person and would take on the role of “working father” for a week and let him feel the full weight of being a stay at home parent    It’s bloody hard and I would be pissed if someone said that stuff to me I’m pretty much a SAHD  I work a couple evenings a week for 4 5 hours or so just to bring in a little extra cash  But it can be pretty exhausting keeping up with the house and kids  Like your friend my children are extremely active  Both my children are on the spectrum and one also has ADHD  It’s draining trying to keep up with hyperactive 10 year olds all summer and keeping up with all the chores  Your husband shouldn’t be so cocky that he is blessed  Good on you for calling him out  start giving him a few more chores  He definitely thinks he could handle it  Then him bragging about how easy he has it then complaining about making sacrifices doesn’t make much sense  You’re definitely NTA You don t need to fight here  Just stop doing the work you do for like a week or 2 or maybe a month  He wouldn t say sorry ofcourse  But he sure would realise and you can start doing the chores again increasing from 0 to 40% eventuallyDad here  So I actually do do all the chores  My wife does genuinely not lift a finger around the house inside or out and I do the majority of the childcare 90 10     I grew up raising my siblings and doing chores  She only did chores if she needed extra pocket money   Last job I was working 45  hours a week and taking care of the house  3 dogs  our toddler  my wife I was getting up at 3 am going to bed at 11 pm  It was exhausting     Current job is a contracted part time job I pick my own hours for  I get up at 4 now  workout  then do chores and cook and depending on the day will be done 11am 2pm range   Weekends wife sleeps in til 11 and I hang out with our toddler take her to the store the park go outside have her help me with little things around the house  It’s not as bad as before  but still hard    NTA  Give him a heads up that you’re going to stop doing certain things  Pick a couple of the easiest for yourself  if you feel the need to   And let him do the rest  If you’re the sole provider  and your agreement is to have him do the chores and take care of the household  you’re not doing your end of the bargain if you’re still working  It’s not from a malicious place  it’s for your own mental health as well Stop assisting him  He is really taking it too far with a TikTok and a blog when he is not doing 100%  And I think you are doing far more than 40%  more like 75%    Food prep for lunches is a good place to start dropping tasks  If you enjoy breakfasts  keep doing that  Otherwise  get ready for work  leave early after kissing everyone goodbye and leave Mr  “This is so easy  women just like to complain” to fend for two meals  getting both kids fed and your oldest off to school with the lunch he prepared packed  Laundry  Your clothes only    I’m petty so I’d just stop but you could say something to him about how you need more time and are not able to do the things you usually do    Honestly your spouse needs a hardcore reality check  His attitude sounds insufferable There is a simple solution   you don’t do any chores or meal preps  If it’s so easy he has plenty of time during the day…  The only thing that should be 50 50 really is childcare after you are out of work    The majority of SAHMs get no help at all and he’s wrong for comparing  Just give him a taste of how difficult his life could be…NTA your husband is a smug jerk  Or does he feel the need to put down women in general and you in particular because he’s insecure in his role  Who knows but he’s definitely not a person I would want to be around  Ughsounds like he barely passes as a man  let alone a dad   NTA  you should show him what not lifting a finger looks like NTA   Stop doing what you’re doing and he can see just how much you do around the house   They’re not significant   You don’t lift a finger   Really don’t life a finger and have him do all the work   He’ll shut up real quick YTA for not standing up for your friend when he was putting her down  You re right that he was unacceptably rude  I would have pointed out  in public  all the ways in which he gets help in which he doesn t  And now I would help him have the real SAHM experience  where you expect him to actually do all the chores especially the  easy  ones you re supposedly in charge of He sounds like a very disrespectful person all around  maybe a narcissist  They think they’re better than everyone  and feel best when putting others down  You probably do have lovely  easy children  I did  and was very grateful  Most kids are a handful at least some of the time  I’d see those other families and shiver  Anyway  you should never throw stones at other people’s houses  he has no idea what’s going on in their lives  Maybe he sucks at keeping the home in order  Done properly it’s a huge pia  Why is he not doing his stuff plus half the things you are  It sounds like he is quite free  If that suits you as a family  rock on  but he probably isn’t that busy vacuuming and dusting and food shopping and making all the meals  etc  that’s not easy  it’s tedious and time consuming  I doubt you can fix someone who is so very rude  you’ve got to date carefully  Respect towards others is top of the list  Good luck with him  he sounds like quite a pill Time for a strike  Mama  If he thinks you don’t do much  then stop doing it  Tell him those responsibilities fall under the stay at home parent’s responsibilities and since it wasn’t that much of a lift anyways  you will let him handle it since you work outside the home  See how fast he gets overwhelmed  Your strike doesn’t have to be forever  Just until he gets his head out of his a    NTANTA  I see many SAHD’s do this  They do do most of the caregiving to the children  but still do fewer daily chores than SAHM’s do on top of the direct caregiving  Then they talk about how easy it is and that women are ridiculous for saying it can be overwhelming   But the appointments  the planning  the gift getting for other kids birthday presents  the cataloging that clothes are getting too small  the school supplies needed  etc  are still handled by mom  The oft mentioned “mental load ”Stop helping him out  and then he’ll see how hard it actually is  You work and bring in the money AND then do all the duties at home that actually help out your family    NTA but you will be if you keep letting your husband go off OP  I m honestly curious  if you d known ahead of time that your husband was such an entitled dick  would you still have married him had his kids  If you could have peered into a crystal ball  before you agreed to marry him  and seen the man he is right now   would you still choose him I think it s time you took a little break from your contribution and do what so many men think is acceptable  Come home from work  eat dinner and then   nothing  Perhaps say goodnight to the kids  But no chores  no helping out   he has all day  and it s  so easy   so he has no grounds to complain  right   To clarify  I DON T think it s acceptable  but it s what  literal generations  of women have done so perhaps he needs a lesson in why women aren t  complaining about nothing  and it should knock his bullshit on the head  Have a frank conversation with him before you do it  and let him know the experiment will end as soon as he feels overwhelmed and can t cope  apologises and asks to resume your former routine workload splut  Then sit back and watch him flounder  with the obvious caveat that the kids don t suffer and you ll step in if they do   but you don t have to tell  him  that   Let him fail and then humble himself  If he can t be respectful  it s time for the nuclear option 🤷‍♀️  Edit  also  100% NTA and perhaps you should let him see the responses to your post   hopefully it will shake him a little  If you re reading this  Mr OP  you re TA right now but you re not  quite  irredeemable  yet   but you need to make a change in your attitude and make it NOW NTA I understand you completely and you’re 100% right my advice is you should offer him the challenge to prove  his views of it being easy and your contributions not being of any significance to actually help him be a SAHD   He can give his lessons on how to do parenting better as a stay at home parent if he does it alone like Ashley and others do without any help from their spouse  Say a month but hopefully you won’t need a month to get the point across once you stop helping him    For a week you should drop the rope and let him be a sahp like most other mums where the partner only provides financially  He says the things you do are not important and not significant to the running of the household and kids so give him the full reigns to run the home as he sees fit without your input or help… let him do the bath time bedtime routine everyday alone  give him the childrens diary and make him responsible for any appointments and schooling scheduling needs the kids have  let him do the meal preps  make dinner and lunches  including yours just like other SAHPs  if he doesn’t do yours buy lunch and save the receipts  if he orders in lunch or dinner  that week get the receipts    Take overtime at work that week or go gym  get a drink or meet with friends after work that week so you come home later  Apart from playing with the kids be the SAHP most dads are just for that week   At the end of week on Sunday have a meeting with him once the kids are in bed to review how that week worked for you both  Use receipts as proof of help needed if you had to buy lunch or dinner two things you help with or do completely   He’s not appreciating your contributions or respecting what you do in the home to make both of your life’s easier and better for your children  Maybe after the week he will appreciate you if not go onto week two and add a night out with your friends on Saturday   Because he has created a social media presence to highlight himself as a SAHD and publicly set himself up as the perfect SAHP offering his opinions and advice he has to be challenged  He’s based his SM  and views off his highly inflated ego and lying that he does everything alone regarding the household chores and children yet he hasn’t taken on the majority of the mental loads regarding the children appointments… him saying it’s easy and others are doing things wrong and woman are using their gender and lying about how hard it is if they find any part of parenting difficult is not only wrong but mentally damaging for other parents both male and female that are doing most of the work alone or dealing with child that has special needs and need more support    Like you said Relationships needs two people putting in the work to make it successful  it also needs respect and consideration of each other’s needs and feelings  It seems like it’s expected or you and taken for granted but there very little consideration regarding you and little to no respect for what you do  He’s being very careless with you  It can’t only be you putting in the effort to be mindful of caring about his emotional and mental well being   I hope he figures things out and stops taking you for granted and overcompensating for his insecurities in being a SAHD and taking his issues regarding that out on others by belittling them and the your daily input at home  It should not take making others feel small or bad about themselves and their parenting for him to feel good about himself  I hope he finds real inner peace with being a SAHD just stop doing everything for him and see how he copes  when you do please update meStop helping  Full out  Just work and bring home the bacon  Your husband is a sexist ah  Sorry but he is  Let him see what a sahm really does  Then please let us know how it goes   Btw  definitely NTAI am a SAHM  and I have a husband who does nothing around the house at all  not even the typical husband chores like mowing the lawn  or the common adult things such as putting your trash in the trashcan  or dirty cloths in the hamper  I am pretty sure he doesn t even know how to open the dishwasher  This being said  he once had the nerve to tell me I am lazy  do nothing  and have it so easy as a SAHM  so I decided to do just that  I didn t lift a finger around the house  I didn t pay any of the bills in his name  I didn t reschedule any of his appointments or make the appointments he had asked for  I didn t have his lunch packed  or dinner ready for him when he got home  I did not go pick up things he likes needed from the store  I focused only on the kids and their homeschooling and did nothing else   Within the week  our house had gone from spotless to just plain nasty  Within 2 weeks  he was begging to start working again and apologizing  He has never since said anything of the like to me again  and if I do miss something or fall behind  he now asks what s wrong rather than getting angry with me  and he often tells me he appretiates everything that I do  I honestly think that your husband needs an eye opener  If not on how hard being a stay at home parent is for the majority  then on how much you do to help him out  You deserve respect and appreciation  too  and his attitude isn t showing that  I would seriously start doing what he thinks you do  nothing    let him see first hand both how being an actual sahd is and how much you do to help him out  Some people only realize what they have when it s gone He’s not a stay at home day  He’s a dad who does nothing but stay at home  You’re THE parent in the household  He’s just another kid you have to take care of  He seems like he’s selfish  arrogant and vastly overestimates both his abilities and worth    He seems like the type of person who likes to lord things over others’ heads  He made a whole website about how much of a better stay at home parent he is than everyone else for goodness sake   It seems like you’re marriage problems run incredibly deep  Deeper than just this  He’s not being your partner  He’s doing the bare minimum while creating a fantasy world where he’s your equalstand up for yourself  I would immediately stop doing anything around the house so he can quickly see what you contribute go the household   I would also quickly point out  after stopping all the extra help to him if it s so  easy  then he should get a job and allow is his wife to do all the easy task  Guarantee he sings a different tune Stop helping him for a minimum of a week so he can see how it feels for a majority of stay at home moms who do everything without help from their partners  Then maybe he won’t go acting like he’s better than everyone who “complains”Stop helping him  For a couple weeks act like you’re the husband and he’s a REAL sahm  Don’t do housework  don’t cook  drop your dirty laundry on the floor  leave your dishes in the sink  etc   let him figure out how much work you do so he can live in his little fantasy world  If that doesn’t wake him up  it may be time to reevaluate your situation  It’ll be much easier for you to be a single parent than it will be for him Welcome to reality   It rarely matters how much the person who works outside the home does at home  its never enough   Husband s complain that they work 50 hours a week  do all the yard work  all the home maintenance  all the auto maintenance  and help out a little in the house   They get eviscerated if they don t pitch in 50 50 on housework and give the stay at home parent time off at night and on the weekends   We ran the actual numbers with my partner who was stay at home   Turned out  I was putting in 30 more hours per week of  work  outside and inside the home   Try documenting both of your workloads fairly and see what the work equity comes out to be   It may not work out with cleaning or cooking  look at everything   If your husband is in a deficit  let him know I kinda want to punch your husband in the throat for his holier than thou attitude and need to put it out there in a way that shames mothers  What an ass  He thinks it’s easy because you make it that way  He thinks it’s easy but you’re carrying the mental load    I love that he is normalizing being a SAHD but he needs a perspective change and to be humble  He needs to recognize that he doesn’t have the stress of being a woman in our society as well as being a SAHParent    Of course you are not wrong for pointing out your contribution  Your husband is acting like a martyr and it’s exhausting  Good luck with that  NTAI’ll reserve judgement  but you do realize what you’re doing to help around the house is the same amount of effort SAHMs request from their husbands  right  SAHMs swear that their husbands should still do chores around the house regardless if the husband is the sole breadwinner  which I agree w    So  by your logic  being a SAHM would be the easiest job ever if husbands succumbed to their spouses’ requests NTA  Show him how hard it really is  Get very busy and show him how all those things you do that he thinks are insignificant add up show him what being a real SAHD looks likeNTA   if it’s so easy he can do it allNta dont help with anything he takes you for grantedI was a SAHD for a year   Easiest job I have had in my life   I did all the cleaning  cooking   everything and got to play with my kids all day     By far the most entitled  job  someone can have NTA  Tell him that his ego is going to make you resent him if he keeps it upESH  He is undermining the work you put it  And you sound a bit jealous  But I challenge this  if he s a TRUE SAHD  he should basically do what Ashley does and you do what Ashley s husband does and see what your husband thinks  He sounds like he needs to be knocked down a peg and made to be more humble  Have him ask other SAHPs to see what their choose split list is and challenge to do the roles    Tell him  this isn t to show you you don t do enough but it goes to show you that each SAHP has a different dynamic and you re truly taking ours for granted  I challenge you to do 1 full week as Ashley does and then we ll talk  We aren t going to go back on anything if you have realized you are very lucky for me   I grew up in a house where my dad didn t even lift a finger and my mom did literally everything around the house    So just like your current house expect your husband has no job and you not only do everything  but have a job too   Stop with all of the cooking  meal prep  everything  Doing the breakfast is good because he is getting the kid ready for school  but stop with all of the cooking  Everything goes to his head and he was rude to a mom Imagine genders being reversed in this story  Conclusion would be completely different YTA for letting your husband talk to your friend and  you  like that  You re also exposing your children to that  Let him take on the role as a SAHD to prove your point  Otherwise  he s just a dad that is unemployed and frankly  at that point  he needs to get a job or something and contribute more Everyone telling you to back off chores to teach him a lesson isn’t giving good advice  He likes his life and is likely giving a positive experience for your kids  and you seem to like him     He’s likely just a skilled concentrated person so the things he does are easy for him and he might just enjoy raising kids and spending time with them    I would just tell him the issue is his attitude towards others  Think of it like money  when you have it it’s great and you get to enjoy things more  But when you brag to your friends about how easy you have money it comes off as rude and shitty   Your contributions are likely helpful and making this easier on him in ways he doesn’t see  but that’s kinda the whole point of being a spouse  Meanwhile his contributions allow you to spend quality time with the kids without being stressed on chores    Women often minimize men’s roles in the home as well  they may not do a lot of house chores  but handle home improvement  yard work  auto maintenance  That’s not as zero effort as people make it out to be    So yes  he needs to fix this  but don’t try and teach him a lesson   If the money thing doesn’t work tell him to imagine he had a corporate job he was good at  would you walk by coworkers and tell them they are dumb and slow I mean  if no one is gonna say it will  why tf does this lady get a pass   Reddit absolutely loves to circlejerk about how STAH Moms have a right to demand breaks and labor from their overtime working husbands  because their “jOBs NeVEr StoP”   I’m sure you are doing a fair amount of work OP  it totally depends on the actually facts of the scenario  but Reddit loves to remind people that work FT that doing extra chores and helping your STAH partner is an absolute obligation    I would say it seems like your husband is being TA  but it honestly pisses me off to no end that people here are praising you when other stay home parents probably do less than your husband  bitch  and somehow earn sympathy that their overworked FT spouse should pick up slack deleted I actually think it s both YTA AND NTA   Where your nta is the fact that he is full of it and doesn t know what truly doing it all means    Where YTA is you didn t immediately rip him up while your  friend  was still there   Do you really think you were a good friend to wait till she left to quietly scold him   You should have blasted all those facts in his face  then told him you would spend the next week at her place helping her out while her lousy husband stayed with you   Or at least stop doing all the extra shit you are doing YTA if the shoe was on the other foot would you like itSounds like me ex wife  According to her  i never did anything either  Good luck with that UNPOPULAR OPINION   Not a parent  so I ll accept the scoffs  After the baby toddler years  being a stay at home parent seems VERY manageable  Again  I must stress that the first years must be hell   breast pumping  picky eaters  tantrums  bedtimes etc  but once kids are past 8 it seems easy enough  90% of it seems like things you would just do as an adult anyway  Is extra loads of laundry REALLY that draining  Is cooking a larger portion of food really that time consuming  Is driving to soccer practice really a huge hassle  Granted  I ve never had to deal with hardcore ADHD kids  But I ve taken care of multiple kids at once  for weeks on end  full 24 hours a day child care  Again  it really wasn t that hard  Maybe the kids I had were easy  What I found was that the KIDS personalities themselves were draining  but the chores  were not  Laundry and cooking the odd doctors appointment I do that stuff anyway  Honestly  big whoop   Info   this is realy a  AITA  post and not a relation ship advice post   or a self validation    Look at me I m the breadwiner and I also to chores at the house   YTA  Really…YTA  if a MAN said this to a woman everyone would be up in arms so I will treat you the same way  Do you want a cookie for doing your job as a parent  Do you want a cookie for helping around   It’s your job just as much as his NTA   and I’m going to sound like an absolute asshole for this  but boy is it a breath of fresh air hearing this coming from a woman  I think many men will attest “been there  done that” in this kinda of situation  no matter how much you do it will never be enough and you’ll never be seen or valuedYes  teach him a lesson and make him feel like crap  have him divorce you and you can pay alimony   ruin your kids life   Should make up for hurt feelings      Great advice   Or  you can talk to him  however  your reaction to lock yourself in the share bedroom says a lot    Seek councelling NTA  I think you should stop doing what you do to help out so he can appreciate the work you put inNTA but your husband is NTA   stop doing it ALL statAs others have said  stop doing anything  Clean up after yourself…but not anything else  Make only your lunch and quit cooking dinner  NTAWhy are you doing all these things NTA  I think you should take the training wheels off  Stop doing your share   Let s see how  easy  it remains for your darling SAHD  and how quickly he starts to bitch about it being too much work NTA you should let him handle everything with the kids and cleaning NTA  go on a vacation and leave him home with the kids alone for a week  It shouldn’t be an issue since “your contribution is minimal”  Then he can experience being a real stay at home dad Nta  I would stop doing the chores that you do for a while to let him see how hard it really is Stop helping him outI know you wouldn t want to add fire to the flame but dude  just stop helping him for the next few days and let him see how tough it actually is  Tell him    Since those chores are so easy to do and insignificant  I ll stop doing them and you can take over   Let him experience it Stop helping  I have adhd and a stay at home mom  My son is 6 months and my daughter is 10 and will be back in school in august  To me it’s the easiest thing in the world  I also have help  and when you do have help it is the easiest job in the world  He needs to be left to cooking and getting kids ready and all that fun jazznta  your husband sounds so irritating  i would demand couples counseling because the way he treats other people  including your FRIENDS is disgusting  he’s got this superior complex and needs to be knocked down a peg  what an asshole NTA  stop doing your part for a day week… that would probably teach him a lesson NTA   Your contributions are going to his over inflated self absorbed head  Stop  Just stop helping him and let him experience full on SAHPing  Until he realizes why he has it so easy  your husband is going to continue to be an ass about this NTA  Stop helping  It’s no easy  He can do it all His attitude makes him the AH but I can’t help but think if genders were reversed and the attitude and comments weren’t included  most comments would be bashing the husband for having OPs opinion Why don’t you quit doing all the chores you normally do  Your husband could see how it really is  NTANTA   Stop helping out with cleaning and house chores  excluding helping your kids  of course  and then see what he says Hmmm   If he actually believes it is extremely easy to be a stay at home parent  then you should let him be that exactly    Don t cook dinner  Don t give baths  Don t do laundry  Don t do breakfast  He is in fact the SAHD  Show him what countless women do every single day of their lives WHILE working full time jobs themselves    He will most likely get angry that he is now  magically  dealing with a lot more  He will confront you about it and probably ascuse you of not doing your fair share of the work  You can then say to him   what do you mean  You told Ashley it was easy  Why are you complaining     He will call you out on not helping  That is the time to tell him that the SAHD part he thinks is SO easy  is because you are helping a ton while being the breadwinner  His workload has gone up and he is complaining BECAUSE you are not helping and this is the wake up call that it s not actually easy  he just has a easier time because of your help    If he wants to be partners  he needs to stop being full of himself and start realizing he s not even doing everything himself I m not sure why on earth you ve allowed this jerk to spew this BS for this long to the point he s blogging and such  Really   Why are you okay with your kids around someone teaching them this mentality   Why are you okay receiving no respect for your contribution   Y T A to yourself for not shutting this down long ago  Why are you okay with being married to a jerk     Y T A to Ashley for not shutting him down in front of her and allowing her to be hurt and embarrassed by him  How awful to do that to a friend  Your husband was rude and insulting to your friend and didn t care about hurting her or upsetting you  In what world is that okay NTA sounds like he’s open to expanding his role so he can really be challenged and show off how great he is as a stay at home parent  Good on you for trying to check his condescension                            Post Title  AITA for supporting the UK when I was born in the USA content  I was born in the USA but have British grandparents so I am part british  A few of my buddies were talking and they were trashing the UK soccer team and saying that the USA will beat them in the world cup  I kind of lost it and told them ill be supporting the UK when the world cup comes to the US and they were shocked  I said id rather watch Harry Kane score hella good goals and be part of that for the UK than the USA team who play boring standard football imo  I also love beckham who used to live and work in the UK and played for manchester  Im a huge Crystal Palace fan but still respect the guy he was hella good back when he played for UK and destroyed Greece  I also think the UK have better chants when rooting for the team  the songs are more catchy and I prefer the Jerseys and have been practicing some of the chants to support the team I found online   I told my friends about it and they said that I should be supporting the USA but because im part british I feel I should be able to chose Comments  Do whatever you

 3  I  21F  just had my 21st birthday literally ended eight hours ago and some thoughts are laying on my mind wondering if I overreacted or maybe I should’ve given them a chance to explain themselves  I’m going to be changing everyone’s names and their personal info just a bit for private reasons   I planned a cute little 2000’s   Bratz themed birthday party for my 21st so we went ALLL OUT  A karaoke machine  my diy Bratz Photo Booth  photo props  I spent time on personalized cups for each girl that was coming  prize gift bags  personalized games  a makeup station  the food  the color scheme  saving up money for the pool and heading to the bar afterwards   the WHOLE big bang    Party planning is something I love to do because to me  birthday parties aren’t just about the birthday boy girl it’s also about the people who are there to help celebrate the big day  I made plans for 10 people to show up  One girl we will call Riley  19F     Riley and I have been off on again friends since high school but when I was a senior in High School she literally ditched me for an ex friend who literally was spreading rumors about me because I wouldn’t date her    So about a year after she graduated high school  she was two year under me  she texted me one day asking if I wanted to rekindle our friendship  I told her I wasn’t sure because of how she treated me during my senior year and it really hurt me  I told her I’d slowly give her a chance to prove herself  So about two months ago is when we started hanging out  Riley told me went I started planning my birthday two months prior to the night before she was coming to my birthday   Nora   20F  Nora and I graduated in the same class we knew each other since 7th grade but never became friends until after  We would Snapchat a little bit 3 4 times a week  Hang out on rare occasion  When she started dating her boyfriend she slowly stopped talking to everyone but promised me from June to the day before my birthday she would be there   From June to the day before  they both with send me texts saying their opinions on plans helping me with ideas suggestions  excited about their cups because I sent pictures before they were finalized  They loved them    So my knowledge they were coming to my party  In the group chat with the rest of the girls I sent out a little reminder a week before and the night before “Hey ladies please remember to be at my house before 12 to drop off your stuff because we’re leaving at 12pm sharp  🩷”   Everyone answered except Nora and Rachal  They read it but never responded so the following morning I text them while I’m at my family breakfast to see what time the ere coming     crickets   So I text Riley and Nora again      crickets     I check their social medias through the day and you know what I find  Nora is at her bf’s house two hours away at a his house  Riley’s at our towns mall with her boyfriend  No text  No call  They ghosted me  Posting on their stories and socials but won’t even answer my texts    It wasn’t too shocking from Riley  Riley had a strong history of doing stuff like this since middle school but Nora always would tell me how she hates people who would ghost people  So how could she do that to me  She knew how hard I worked on everything  It’s not that hard to text “Hey sorry I can’t come ” I would be sad but being ghosted ignored while you post about where you are when you said you’d be here   Watching my socials WHILE ignoring me  Nah that’s gonna piss me off   So after my birthday I made a small post on social media of the pictures the girls took  It was a great night  Thankfully not hungover haha    But the morning after I unadded them on everything because of how upset I felt  I asked one of my best friends what she thinks and she agrees with me that “just unadd them and ghost them like they ghosted you ”   Maybe I’m just in my feelings but I feel like I deserve an explanation instead of being ghosted  I feel disrespected  The time and energy I wasted on their cups  I don’t even know what to do with them now    Am I in the AITA Comments  NTA however  it depends on how important those friends are to you how you should proceed  Maybe I m just too old  but for people who really matter to me  I would try to have a conversation instead of ghosting them  Let them know that they hurt you by not showing up and ghosting you instead of doing the same thing by ghosting them  If they are good friends  maybe you can clear the air and move on                             Post Title  AITAH or telling my mom and aunt they

pay her  and they get their baked goods   Mom and Aunt have asked my wife to re create my grandma’s carrot cake recipe on many occasions   My wife has done this  down to perfect detail  and even my mom and aunt have said it might be better than my grandma’s     Now down to what caused me to blow up  My aunt was having a birthday party at her work and asked my wife to bake 2 dozen cupcakes  After the party  my aunt said  “They were a hit  and probably your best batch yet   But did you change something in the recipe  They were lighter  and even more moist than the last couple times you have made them for us ”  My wife responded  “Nope  Followed the recipe on my fridge as I always do ”  Aunt – “No   I know my mom’s cupcakes  and you have made them perfectly before   This time you had to have used a different recipe  or ingredient  Did you use cake flour this time ”  Wife – “No   This is even the same bag of flour I used the last time ” Aunt – “No   I know you did something this time  I know my mom’s recipe  and this is not her recipe ”   I told my wife to drop it  as it was going nowhere  and was starting to irritate her  My mom texted us later  “What did you do to the cupcakes  We want to know so that the next time we make them  we know what to do to make them taste just as good ” My wife responded with everything she had said before   I told my mother to drop it  that she just read the recipe and went with it  as she always does    A few days later  I caught my wife staring at the recipe on the fridge reading the recipe and asking out loud what she possibly could have done different this last go around   I could see she was upset  so I messaged my mom and aunt that they needed to apologize to her  because they ultimately were calling my wife a liar  My mom  “We didn’t say those words  That’s rude and upsetting you would think we’re calling her a liar  Apologize to us ” during this back and forth  my wife had made the comment to me that she would be okay if they weren t at the hospital during the birth    After a little bit of back and forth of me being  what I feel  gaslighted  by them saying they are not calling my wife a liar  I said  “Well  Until you can apologize to her for calling her a liar  don’t visit the hospital when she gives birth  We are not telling you the day we’re going in for delivery until you do ”  This has set a chain of events off in my family   My sisters agree with me  but my Mom  Aunt  and their friends have reached out saying I crossed a line  Even my wife has said that’s a little extreme   But when she s asked to talk to me about it  she says she respects the decision    So Reddit  AITAH  I keep being told it’s petty to have this much of a blowup over a cupcake recipe  but I feel that it’s disrespectful to my wife  she says she’s not  that  upset  but as I said above  I catch her reading the recipe on the fridge and talking to herself about it throughout the days  I don’t want my mom and aunts behaviors to continue through to our daughter  and I fear that they may do something similar to her down the line  This is how they’ve always been   Edit  hey Reddit  With all due respect  I appreciate the comments  but I know my wife better than anyone commenting  The comments of   making the decision without consulting her  are baseless  While we didn t have that exact conversation  and she didn t ask my family to not be there  I know what she was thinking because we communicate    It s like  how you don t ask someone to marry you unless you know the answer is yes  think along the same lines    My wife has also since then  told me she was ok with uninviting them from going to the hospital   Edit 2  I m getting a surprisingly high number of requests for the recipe  I asked the wife if I could share it  She said   Quit gossiping  Take a picture of the recipe  Apologize for misspellings as I had pregnancy brain  and please let them know that I add a tsp of vanilla extract to the cake batter as well  Oh  and let them know that they can use any combination of carrots  2 cups baby food  2 cups shredded baby carrots  or one of each    Here it is  https   ibb co rsKVFKk   Cook in a Bundt pan for 1 hour  Cupcakes are 23 24 minutes depending on gas or electric    She s curious what people think of the recipe  She added she s not responsible for any family fights it may cause   Edit 3  cupcake tax and a picture of the exact cupcakes in question  https   ibb co R6SDfkK  Final edit  this will be possibly my final edit  I have spent too much time on here today  I respect all of your answers  I definitely understand where my outbursts caused a problem  I m going to apologize to my mother and tell her that she just needs to respect my wife a little more  and while she may not feel she did wrong  my wife took it a certain way  and that you can t help how people feel  I agree that she s the innocent one in all this  and I appreciate all the positive words directed her way  even if there were not so kind words directed mine  I get it    My wife has felt kind of like a celebrity tonight  and we have joined together in laughing in some of the comments  She hopes that her carrot cake recipe doesn t result in any family feuds    I especially appreciate those that gave advice  I read through each and every one of them  and we had a great conversation surrounding some things you all said  I hope in some of my comments  I didn t come off as altruistic  I do kinda love her    If any of you make the carrot cake  please entertain a pregnant woman s wishes and send me a message about what you think   One more edit  Today was crazy  Wife approached me and thanked me because she was trying to find a way to approach the subject about wanting her privacy at the hospital  She said that  while this chain of events didn t go the way as planned  it ended with the result she wanted  She had thought maybe I wanted them there at the hospital  and was waiting for the right time to talk to me  But really  Who would want this family there     family had been told that decision is final  Brother in law accused me of   in 6k years of family bond  I am the one to break that tradition     Thank you all  I appreciate the ones who said I have first world problems  I m glad I m fortunate enough that this is my biggest problem    And thank you all so much for the baby well wishes  We re over the moon about this little girl   Have a great life  y all Comments  Wait  do you mean IN the delivery room  Hell no  you don’t need an audience for that intimate moment It could have been as simple as the freaking temperature or humidity that day  beat the mix an extra 30 seconds   Maybe the eggs were fresher than normal   There are so many variables when it comes to baking   For them to harp about   you must have done something   is ridiculous     They should apologize that they were perhaps rude    You are bringing a new life into the family don t let it be tainted by something this silly NTA  It’s not about the cake recipe  it’s about them disrespecting and bullying your wife  Since your mom and aunt have the recipe  tell them from now on they can make it themselves if they don’t want to believe your wife   I don’t want my mom and aunts behaviors to continue through to our daughter  and I fear that they may do something similar to her down the line  This is how they’ve always been     So  your reaction is to a pattern of gaslighting disrespect they have always exhibited   This is about a lot more than cupcakes   I think you should discuss this with your wife and both of you should decide on boundaries as a couple   I take it you have seen the pattern your whole life and she is new to it   NTA NTA  if what you wrote is true and the whole truth it looks like this situation could have snowballed   Cut it off now so your wife is not upset or reading the recipe over and over NTA    Now I’m craving carrot cake 😂NTA you know your family better than anyone else  I love that you are protecting your wife ❤️NTA    Because it isn t ABOUT the cupcakes  It s about a complete lack of respect for you and your wife    I agree with other comments here  Your mom and aunt can make those cupcakes on their own  I have to ask  is this the only time they ve done something like this  Picked up something stupid and small and turned it into a chance to bully your wife I still  think that there needs to be a PSA campaign  to inform  everyone  that giving birth IS NOT A SPECTATOR  SPORT   I wouldn’t want them at the hospital either way  After having two kids we will never go visit anyone with a new baby at the hospital again  deleted NTA This isn t the first time they ve been like this or you wouldn t be reacting so strongly  Your wife deserves peace and they are not peaceful people  You are protecting your wife  Well done NTA    “Nope  Followed the recipe on my fridge as I always do” should have been where the Aunt says “oh okay ” And then moves on  Constantly badgering your wife over cupcakes while shes pregnant is just rude and disrespectful    BUT your wife ultimately gets to decide who is there for the birth  ALSO  yall need to settle this dispute before the baby is born You’re sweet to defend your wife so passionately  I can tell you love her a lot  NTA because it’s not about the recipe it’s about respect  They aren’t respecting or trusting her and that’s infuriating to you obviously  And then they doubled down and demanded you apologize  So they need to understand your feelings also matter  Stand your ground NTA  It s not about cake  it s about respect  healthy communication and boundaries  They are really emotionally stressing her out  which has to stop or it will indeed continue to the next generation   Good for you sticking by your wife with all that pressure on you NTA  your wife  who I’m guessing is either non confrontational in general  or at least non confrontational to your family  said she wouldn’t be upset if they weren’t at the birth  I would take this as she doesn’t want them there but doesn’t know how to say that or want to say that directly to them   Yes it started over cupcakes but your mum and aunt have been incredibly rude and disrespectful by not dropping it when your wife has said nothing changed    Your wife should have whoever she feels comfortable  secure and safe with during the birth and your mum  and aunt for whatever reason she was going to be there too   have proven that they aren’t the right people NTA  This isn t about the cake  this is about your family disrespecting your wife and from the sounds of your comments being chronic gaslighters    It may be time to simply sit down with the family and draw some hard lines in the sand about what is and isn t ok  If they cannot agree then you can make a decision from there as a team with your wife  Maybe for now no more baking for the family  If they cannot accept that your wife didn t change anything about the recipe to the point it s been weeks and they have her questioning herself     They don t get anymore baked goods  They can also get their numbers blocked This is pretty bizarre but your wife has the right to have anyone there or not there NTAI m going to give a top level comment to address some questions on this topic    On the day of the cupcake war  the following things happened  The KitchenAid broke  Worm gear had broke apart  And we were going to my mother s house for dinner    My wife prepared the ingredients at home using a hand mixer  and we baked in my mom s whirlpool electric oven    An exact comment to my mom  and her response went like this   we re not lying  It was made the same way as the last few times  She didn t use her KitchenAid and used your oven  Could that be the difference   Mom    she said both are very good  but she knows it s not the same recipe   NTA   Cupcakes and cakes bake differently  There is less batter to climb and will end up being less dense  It’s also why the cooking times are different  They are harassing your pregnant wife  Maybe she made a happy mistake but it doesn’t matter    Thank you for protecting your wife  You are not blowing up over a recipe  You are projecting your very pregnant wife from being stressed about two older family members harassing her unnecessarily It’s kinda refreshing to see family drama about something so petty to be honest  I mean  you both get to decide what makes you comfortable and you know your family best    I imagine your mom and aunt weren’t trying to be rude but are just the typical overbearing type  It’s still annoying and if it upset you that it upset your wife  have her back    Hope your baby is healthy Honestly  giving birth isn’t a spectator sport   You  your wife and the delivery team are the only people who need to be in the room or hospital    You can send a group text with picture after the happy event and then let them know when you will be receiving visitors    I always suggest  and have told my kids the same thing   get home from the hospital  lock the doors and don’t let anyone in for two weeks    Mom and Dad need to learn about the new baby    Advice and suggestions and help can be great  but too many times one or more women are overbearing that THEIR WAY is the best way and it becomes stressful    You and wife need to learn to be parents  and baby needs to learn how to live in air     Congratulations on the new baby and may everything go smoothly and peacefully I don t understand this need to be at the hospital for anyone apart from mum and her  partner I m a grandmother and I can t think of anything worse than crowding in on my sons wives or my daughter when they ve just given birth let alone waste my time sitting at the hospital whilst she s in labourOkay  so funny enough I’ve actually been searching the web to find a good carrot cake recipe for my partners birthday next week  So Thankyou for this blessing OP and OP’s partner    One question  please  is the 350° in Fahrenheit  Or Celsius  I assume Fahrenheit but I don’t have much experience with baking NTA it’s really good to see someone standing up for his pregnant wife   It’s been a flurry  of those not doing that on here latelyDid your wife want them at the hospital to begin with  Or  was she just putting their wants ahead of her needs NTA They re bullying your wife  She needs to accept that they re not the greatest people and move on  but none of this is her fault    You re a bit of an AH for not defending your wife in the moment  You recognized that your aunt was bullying your wife  but it was still on your wife to end the conversation  You needed to cut her off and point out that she wasn t respecting your wife s honest answers Just tell them that she sneezed into it and since she is made of sugar and spice  she made everything nice This is seriously one the cutest stories  though family fights are serious  I m sorry your Mom and Aunt are acting this way  NTA btw  By cute I just mean you response and edits  And what your wife may have said  I can tell you care for her and obviously know her very well  Congrats on the baby NTA and please post that recipe NTA  If she whipped the sugar and butter any longer than usual  it would make for a lighter and fluffier cake  No change in ingredients necessaryI have a cupcake recipe I use all the time  sometimes if the butter is softer or I mix it for longer they get fluffier and moister  Anything can change a recipe slightly Tell her thank you for sharing with us  that’s so sweet 🩵Just had to come back here to tell your wife I tried the recipe for the carrot cake  My first ever made from scratch cake  Carrot cake is brother s favorite so I invited his family for dinner  We all LOVED IT  Thank you for a happy family moment  Blessings upon You  your home and your progeny If it was a woman complaining people here would say why isn’t the husband defending his wife and putting his family in their place  But it’s a guy here and people are telling him to chill and not to put words in his wife’s mouth  Reddit logic  NTA   Good on you man NTA   Could it have anything to do with them being cupcakes and not cake form like maybe they baked lighter  really no idea   Or Aunt was having such a wonderful party they tasted better with 23 people telling her how great they are     Either way NTA and im sorry they hurt your wife’s feelings  I wish you and your wife an amazing birth and child  WeCame for the story  left with a recipe  Winning  already left my rating opinion in another comment but just saw there was a recipe now  Thank you OP and OPs wife ❤️This is all a storm in a teacup and hopefully will blow over  I’m assuming you took this strong stance because of previous issues    I don’t see why your mother and aunt would be in the waiting room whilst your wife gives birth  It’s a waste of time  They can meet baby in due course  Ensure that anyone meeting your newborn is fully immunised against whooping cough  influenza and COVID  ANYONE   You have bigger things on your plate than a frigging recipe  Get over itOk so you and your wife are awesome  Carrot Cake is the ONLY cake my daughter and I like  I cannot wait to make this  Her 18th birthday is coming up so this is what we are making Thank you for supporting your wife  You both sound amazing  Baking is chemistry  That being said  maybe the carrots could have been at their peak of freshness  Maybe the stars just aligned just right in this one instance  Your mom and aunt need to apologize and let it go NTA  Let your wife know that the extra ingredient was mom love  Now that she’s officially a mom she will make everything this way now  But not for your aunt mom they’re psycho hose beasts   I’m going to make these because I love carrot cake with a burning white hot passion and it’s always terrible store bought  Also no one in my house likes carrot cake so they’re all MINE Eeeeek  Cupcake argument aside  I don’t think all those people should be at the hospital for your wife’s labor anyways  As the saying goes  if you wouldn’t feel comfortable with them watching you make love  then they shouldn’t be in the room with you giving birth  Birth is SUCH an intimate and vulnerable experience  In my opinion  best shared between the parents  Have people meet the baby after you’re home and had a few days  or weeks  to yourself my two cents I m gonna make it  Thank you for sharing   Will send a pic when Im done  Congratulations on the upcoming birth of your daughter  honestly the only person she needs at the time will be you  the more people the more drama  Been there  done that  When AITAH turns into a discussion on baking and commenters exchanging recipes   NTA   The whole notion of a bunch of relatives and inlaws having a right to be at the birth is ridiculous  Giving birth is dangerous  painful  exhausting and intimate  It s not a party    The person giving birth should be free to choose who will be the most supportive and helpful to her  and no other family or friends should be there    Labor pains are kind of like orgasms  in that they won t work so well if the woman s not feeling loved  cared for and completely safe  This is not a family get together  it s about protecting the woman while she goes through a dangerous and painful ordeal NTA Thanks for the story and recipe    And congratulations to all three of you Made these cupcakes tonight and had to say they’re phenomenal  Lol thanks for sharing NTA  I feel like OP has had experiences with gaslighting with the mom and the aunt and is seeing it happen to his wife  They ve got her doubting her reality  OP  you did good standing up and protecting your wife  Definitely not the AH NTA  It isn t about the recipe  It is about respect  Lack of respect shown to your wife and then you  They made it not a cake recipe when they couldn t accept a simple answer and kept pushing           Also any chance we could get your wife s lovely recipe  Sounds like they d be heavenly to throw at people given Thanksgiving is coming soon NTA  No one has the right to be in the delivery room or even at the hospital  not even the husband  without the wife’s permission  It doesn’t matter if there was an argument or not  it’s her choice  I’d recommend not telling them when she goes into labor so they don’t just show up NTA  It’s not about cupcakes cake  it’s about your mother and aunt thinking they can steamroll the two of you and show you who’s boss   If you don’t shut that shit down ASAP  as you have  then they continue to do so   They won’t admit they were wrong  and apologize  Cool  You don’t need to subject your family to people like that  I can think of so many better things to do than hang around people like this  I bet you can  too NTA  They 100% Are calling her a liar I don’t understand how they can possibly not understand that sometimes things can just taste different every time you make something  It could be that an ingredient is fresher or is not as fresh  Little tiny differences can change the taste of something  also things you have eaten or drank can also change the flavor in small ways  They are horrible for not understanding she has no idea on what caused the difference this time compared to other times  NTA  She should have people around her while giving birth that can support her and not cause stress  It honestly sounds like they would cause her stress should they be allowed at the birth NTA It’s 100% your job to wrangle your family and have your wife’s back  They are indeed calling your wife a liar and what’s worse  making her doubt herself NTA and you are not the one being   petty  over the cake recipe  Perhaps your wife  all unknowing  did something a bit different though it s unlikely as baking is a much more precise style of cooking than just regular cooking  It s why bakers rarely cook and cooks rarely bake  But ultimately Who cares  It s literally cake  Your family members are out of control and are indeed calling your wife a liar  Block all except your mom and aunt and let them know if they continue to harangue your wife over such a stupid thing they can wait till your kids are 18 before they can see them  I am a huge fan of going low to no contact with family members who have the mistaken impression they can talk to my spouse in such a manner Why would her MIL and Aunt IL be there for the birth of your child anyway  That’s weird  Is she close with her mother or other family members  Wouldn’t they be first on the list  I’m so confused  I told my husband  I’ll take visits at the hospital when and IF I feel like it  Other than that please don’t just show up NTA  but I hope to God that your wife never and I mean NEVER bakes for them again  They don t deserve it  Fuck them mean old biddies   Sorry to say this  you and your family sound over the top  😂Thank you for sharing the recipe    NTA  This isn’t about cake it’s about respectOMG  they are ridiculous  I’ve made cookies  same recipe and sometimes it comes out a bit different  Maybe I stirred them longer or the temp humidity is different   Your wife doesn’t need the stress of them   NTA  Thanks for the recipe  Will be trying them As someone whose husband did not stand up for me for the first 4 years of marriage until his sister made the mistake of FINALLY saying something shitty about me in front of him  THANK YOU for having your wife s back  Maybe if your mom and aunt actually understood baking were bakers themselves they would understand there are many reasons the same recipe could turn out differently each time   They are the ones being petty over a recipe they don t even make themselves  They have your wife make it  which she does happily   You are a good husband OP  You recognized the problematic behavior and addressed it  Keep up the good work  NTAYour mom and your aunt are not 2nd generation immigrants  That’s not a thing  They are  however  first generation American   assuming they were born here in the US  My father is the youngest among his siblings  He is the only one born in the US  He is also first generation  American  while his siblings are immigrants and naturalized Americans NTA thanks for the recipe Your wife sounds so cute  good luck you twoCake vs cupcakes can also make the bake different  Too many variables to determine  But glad you set a boundary  I don t think you acted out of turn  Too often parents forget that children become adults and should be treated like adults  Reminding them of that and standing up to family for your wife is admirable  in my opinion Mostly commenting so I can find the post again and let you know how the recipe went  my child loves to bake and we ve been looking for a good carrot cake recipe  Anyway it s not about the recipe it s about the disrespect towards your wife  They were calling her a liar without saying the word liar  You re nta   wife should be stressed as little as possible during delivery and you wouldn t want them slipping any snide comments in upsetting her What is a baby food carrot NTA they needed to just take her word and not harass a pregnant woman NTA at all  The two of them acted like immature bullies and your wife doesn t need that in her most vulnerable time   Your wife sounds amazing from what I saw in edit 2 and you sound like such a great advocate for her  I m so happy you have each other  I hope the pregnancy and birth go well and the three of you are in my thoughts  3  Definitely going to try out the recipe  Virtual hugs offered to your wife and a huge thank you The repeated asking after she’s already denied changing anything  does   imply that she’s lying   NTA I m making this recipe next time I have some spare time  in honor of your sweet wife  You two have other things to worry about   ♥️nta  do the both of them realize that cupcakes  or anything baked for the matter  aren t always going to come out the same every single time  something so simple as adding slightly more or less of a single ingredient can completely change everything  That being said this wasn t about cupcakes  it was them just straight up finding an excuse to bully your wife 1c veg oil  2 c All Purp FL  2 c sugar  4 eggs      it s all here   Carrot Cupcake  frosting   you re through Bake Nazi   NEXT From a woman who has given birth twice… and the first time it was rocky… I think it should be just you snd her  This is not a dinner party  This is a life event that will hopefully go off well  but we all know that there may be issues and there may be difficult decisions that you and she will have to make together  At some point  you might need to make them because she might not be clear headed enough  depending on how long and how hard the labor is  These do not sound like people with self control and good judgment  They may mean well but in the moment  you need a calm  clear head  Will the presence of these people contribute to that   You can invite them the moment you know all is well  No sooner I have no opinion on the original post   cause I don t need to have one  I see   but thank you for the updates   Your wife s comment about  quit gossiping and take a photo already  made me laugh this morning  She s a gem  take good care of her  and congrats on the new LO “I don’t know what to tell you  I followed the recipe  If they came out differently than you expect it wasn’t because of something I did consciously that I could re create or tell anyone else how to re create ”  I don’t know why this is so complicated to communicate or to accept People don t understand how much variation goes into measuring ingredients  The moisture in the air gets in the flour  The baking powder could be more or less potent  the carrots could have more or less moisture   She could have accidentally over or under measured something  The humidity in the air  the barometric pressure Well  they did call your wife a liar   And as an avid bakery  humidity in the air can drastically change a recipe  Putting the batter into a different position of the oven can change the finished product  Baking requires literal science  so it’s incredibly possible that ingredients had NOTHING to do with the ‘change’ in the cupcakes  NTACupcakes bake differently than regular cake so they come out lighter and fluffier plus more moist  so that s why they came out  different  all she did was use a different thing to bake in and it changed the way it baked NTA and tell your wife I will have to try this amazing creation NTA and holy crap I love that you stand up for your wife and refuse to allow your family to bully her    It honestly sounds like you two have an amazing marriage and idk what wild hair snuck up their butts  but neither Mom nor Aunt deserve to be around your wife or child until they apologize and cool it  The last thing you all want to deal with that day is their drama    Also  while I m not a fan of carrot cake  thank you and your wife for sharing the recipe  This entire post with all the edits  honestly made my day Nta  Bravo for backing your wife   Pregnancy is hard and I can imagine she is so grateful you have her back    I enjoyed this post The takeaway I got from this is that you had your wife s back and as someone with a narc mom and MIL this makes me proud  Good on you  You are NTA and I m glad you re there for your wife  If it were me  I would have just said  I m sorry you didn t like the cupcakes     and then never baked them a fucking thing again  But I tend to hold a grudge    This is the best AITAH   Carrot cake was our wedding cake  I’ll be make this for my love very soon    Thank your wife for sharing  and may she have a lovely delivery and you both have a healthy baby    NTAH   I m going to buy carrots to make this  When she says baby food carrots is that just steamed and mashed carrots Made the dessert today   Didn’t use baby food as I had lots of garden carrots  it was amazing  Thanks for sharing the recipe  Don’t know how to attach a pic otherwise I would  🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️Omggg I just heard this story on two hot takes podcast and I want the recipe so bad  The links don’t work for me 🥲Nta   Food always tastes better when cooked by someone else   Give your relatives the recipe   tell them to make it themselves  rip up your copy  and stop making it for them   Until they apologize for being lazy leeches  go low contact NTA  Though I would have given one last warning  “Drop this subject now or we will temporarily cut all contact until after the birth because you are upsetting my wife  If you don’t believe me FAFO ”ESH  It s a freaking recipe  It s really not that big of a deal  Figure out y all communication skills  no need for it to blow up to this big of a commotion Your mother and aunt aren t just crossing a boundary  they re throwing up on it  This relentless harassment over a recipe that was not altered has altered your wife s perception of them and rightly so    They seem to just have constant demand after demand of your wife and frankly even if they apologise I don t think they should be told when your wife goes into labour  They ll just step over her boundaries once again in the hospital and it s not something that she needs to deal with   Your poor wife   NTANTA and go you      You are a sweet caring hubby and protect your mama and baby bear papa ❤️NTA  The only people who need to be a the hospital are you and your wife   And you are actually optional    Hope your wife is done baking for them NTA Tell the aunt and your mom to make their own cupcakes from now on   If they persist  tell them that the day your wife made the cupcakes  she had a sudden urge to pee but decided not to stop in the middle of the recipe  so she just dribbled a bit in each cupcake   And that s what made them extra moist NTA  It has nothing to do with the recipe and everything to do with them hounding her and refusing to accept her answer as the truth  They were being pushy and disrespectful As a baker it could be a matter of f$@ ing humidity  Tell your wife I appreciate the recipe and your mom and aunt to look at the weather for that weekend 🤷‍♀️Your wife sounds like a sweetheart  Good for you for sticking up for her  We see on here all too often the complete opposite  I know it’s been said a lot but it wasn’t about the recipe  It was about them not listening to your wife and making her feel bad  They clearly didn’t believe her and weee being passive aggressive  Then when they were called out it wasn’t “you’re right we’re sorry” it was more of the same  NTANTA  It s not about a recipe  It s about the disrespect to your wife  Especially  while she pregnant   Stressing a pregnant woman is seriously bad for mom and babe   You did a good job  Keep them far away NTA a  you were standing up for your wife who is carrying your child  It’s not about the cake  it’s about how they treat your familyNTA  They may know their mother s recipe but they clearly know Jackall about baking NTA and I wanna be friends with your wifeNTA  You defended your wife  You protected her Even if the recipe stuff didn t happen your wife can change her mind at point about who she wants in the room  It s her fucking birth Here for the gossip  NTA  Secret hero  The real question is  what kind of pan do you bake in  A 9x13”  Bundt  Loaf NTA   But  keep everyone out of her hospital room for as long as possible   She needs to rest  not entertain people Thank you for the recipe NTA  it’s a medical procedure that your wife is having done  and just because it ends with a baby doesn’t mean there needs to be an audience    And thank you for the recipe because honestly the more I read about it the more I started craving carrot cake  FFS   Really  these women need something to do with their lives   Your wife doesn’t need this crap when she’s having her baby   Tell them to not show up at the hospital or your home without an invite for the foreseeable future   They’ll see the baby when you and your wife decide it’s ok   Stop letting your respective families have an opinion about this   It’s not their business It could be a change in humidity affecting the flour possibly…… or did they have champagne at the get together You re wife sounds like an absolute sweetheart  and kuddo s to you for having her back  Hope you have a healthy  happy baby Thanks for the recipe  I ve been looking for a good one    NTA  like others have said   it s not about the recipe  It s about the lack of respect  Your wife gave them an answer and they kept pushing as if they don t believe or trust her NTA   The age of the flour can affect the cake  btw You are the MVP coming in with that recipe   NTA  and especially NTA for linking the recipe   That’s great of you to make a stand for your wife  especially knowing she would likely never request you to stand up for her thanks for the recipe  i have a ton of carrot baby food jars unused The “secret” ingredient was love  something clearly lacking their lives  NTA OP NTA   They are just being rude and I think you are great for having your wife s back   Side note   temperature of the room and humidity can cause changes in cooking  Also  if the eggs are normally cold and this time they were room temperature   this could be the difference  If the eggs were fresh er   Even with the same recipe changes in the mixing can make a difference   Tell them to make the cake themselves from now on NTA but quick question  If a person used two cups of carrots instead of one baby food and one carrot does it effect the moisture levels  Or is there something i should do to make up for the moisture difference     Also please tell your wife how amazing she is  I m trying to recreate my grandmother s homemade marshmallow recipe and it s a nightmare   Especially since decades of history tell me that i really can t eat too many of them U both sound like really sweet ppl  U and ur wife  So sorry ur going through this  Family sure do know how to press our button s  I hope you can all come together  after the baby is born  and work something out  Family is family  We love them and we dislike them on and off through the year s  They are still family  And we should always try to forgive them  It takes a while but it s not impossible  Good luck  I will say a prayer for you and your wife she sounds amazing  Poor thing Bless you for sticking up for your wife   I wish my husband would do the same with his family more often I’ll make this on Sunday night  NTA thoIt sounds like you really lucked out with your wonderful wife  Please let her know I m wishing her an easy labor and recovery Your mother and aunt are exhausting  They are harassing your heavily pregnant wife over cupcakes they can’t even make themselves  Good for you for having firm boundaries with them  You need to protect your wife from their irritating none sense  NTANTA  Go to Genius  Leave your parents and cleave to your wife  Your wife  Your child  Your rules  It might be petty  but this is your family  If you break ties  be mature and forgive  but limit future contact  Let them know where you stand and stand there Good grief  can they think of nothing else but fussing NTA and tell your sweetheart or a wife thank you so much for sharing  I have never found a carrot cake recipe that tickled my fancy and this one looks really good 😊NTA your mom and aunt need taking down a notch and maybe this will do it if you stick to your guns  Don’t pull a weapon like this if you don’t intend to fire it Okay but am I going to have to adjust for high altitude NTA  Love when spouses stand up for their partners    I can see your shiny spine from here OPProbably just got some tasty carrots that day  NTANTA  You sound like a really great couple who does communicate well and respect each other  It’s nice to see a spouse stand up for their partner for once  Especially when it’s their own family making the fuss  I’m sure all will work itself out    Congrats on your soon to be born baby and thank you for the recipe Thank you for standing up for your wife and thank you for the recipe ☺️  NTA BTWESHIt’s not about the Iranian yogurt Just wanted to say thanks for having your wife’s back NTA ish  They should have let it go but maybe they feel they have to be the experts on this family recipe so they couldn’t let it go  I feel it’s a bit different than accusing her of lying  I think they’re jealous she’s better at baking this special recipe  I say this because I’m asked to bake stuff and some females get funny about it like this diminishes them  somehow  You flared up because they should have dropped it  It’d be nice if there was a peacemaker in the fam as this has gotten overblown at a bad time and she doesn’t need the stress  nor do you    No point in family fighting over this    I’d get a respected neutral to send a group text saying  “hey folks  life is short  we’re fighting about…  cupcakes when  we’ve got something more important to focus on  Can we all just agree this small thing blew up and let it go  Let’s have a nice gathering when baby is home and everyone is rested ” Or something similar as I doubt they’ll apologize and if they did  they’d be resentful  Btw  I get out of baking questions  by saying I only roughly follow recipes so who knows  Which is totally true of me but maybe not for her  She could say there’s a lot of things that can vary results so hard to say Fanfare   Fireworks   Kissing babies  don’t do this though  Anyone  Unless you pushed it out and or donated half of its DNA     NTA   NTA always stand up for your wife  They should’ve just accepted her answer THANK YOU    Making this for my husband s birthday on Halloween  This is the exact recipe we used in our family in the 70s  but no baby food carrots  a lovely idea though   NTA  So many people ask if they’re AH over something specific but it’s not about the thing but how the situation was handled  Them not taking the fact that she said she changed anything as an answer and continuously saying no no no is what makes them the AHs    Asking for your wife to bake them too when they’re perfectly capable too and doubting her is even more ludicrous  Tell them to apologize or enjoy baking their own damn cakes cupcakes from now on SMDHNTAH  This sounds like a Seinfeld episode  in the best way  Congrats on your baby NTA even if it wasn’t over a cake recipe  Other people have weird expectations of being present for births  It’s a vulnerable time  and there’s no need and should be no expectation  for an audience    As an aside…I know I’m going to get beat up for this  but…do the mother and aunt know about the vanilla wife adds   I know it’s on the recipe shown   just not sure if they are aware  I may have missed where you may have mentioned it    Still NTA  but just throwing that in to the ring to consider what they may be tasting that may not have been done by the grandmother NTA you are awesome to stand up for her  It’d be one thing if they asked if she changed something  When she said she didn’t  they should’ve just said  it tasted extra good  Instead they’re relentless about it  You did the right thing Did she use a different brand of baby carrots or oil  Like I buy Wesson  but I noticed a taste difference between the small and large bottle  I am wondering if that could be it  Also  I notice when I use the large ballon whisk I get different results from the small whisk  Mazel tov on your impending birth Carrot cake is my favorite so tell your wife thanks  Also  while I don’t think you’re you’re an AH  because you’re an expectant parent and probably on edge  but after losing my mom  sister  MIL and BIL in the last two years  please every one make up  You all seem really nice  Congratulations on the baby  🥳NTA  I’m so proud of you for standing up for her  This is what she needed from her husband whether she knows it or not I think OP was right to tell them to keep away from the delivery room  His wife will have enough to be doing besides worrying about a couple of silly women squabbling over a cake recipe  I would have had KITTENS  never mind a baby  if I’d had that needless drama to deal with Nta  It’s not the recipe  it’s the pettinessNTA  If you feel a line is crossed and set the boundaries  then you have the right to your feelings The fewer people at the birth  the better anyway  There s a reason many mammals hide to have their babies Nope not the arsehole  The wife and baby trump everything You are not the a       with this situation your mother and your aunt are cuz they could have just dropped it and left it alone they kept persisting that she changed the recipe  Where they upset because it tastes so much better than before  And that they will not be able to copy it  The recipe sounds delicious  I bake very often  Carrot cake is one of my favorites  I think the baby food carrots contribute to the moisture  I’m going to try this soon NTA OP  Good on you for having your wife’s back  Giving birth is very intimate  Your mom and aunt shouldn’t be there at all  You are all she needs   ETA  Congratulations  Once the baby is born you two are going to feel a love you never knew existed  I’m really happy for you both Recipe tax    LOLBirth  marriage  funerals  etc should be more important than any family issue  I am all about trying to protect your wife from unnecessary stress like your wife telling you it’s ok to uninvite them so you will let it go  but you still won’t  YTA That good of a cup cake  take the changes to your grave   BTW  Congrats on new bundle of joy NTA thank you so much for the recipe ❤️Nta  but I am laughing because at the very end you go   And she did say to  I also add a little vanilla to the cake batter         lmao possible ah ha moment lmaoI would just tell them I whipped the room temp eggs for 6 mins before adding other ingredients   that I double sifted the sugar   Tell your wife I saved the recipe   will be making it  because  carrot cake is an absolute favorite in my house  Also  they are being rude  only made worse by her pregnancy  My daughter just had her son last week  no way did I try to bother her with anything other than good cheer NTA You’re doing your job    This South African man is about to bake these sonsbitches for my little girlNTA  Honestly  differences in texture   moistness come about from such minor things  A marginally larger egg  the length of time mixed  how much air goes into the batter  how long they take to cook   even by seconds   I make cupcakes with my kids to the same recipe my mum has used since she was given it at 16   I m always amazed at the variances in the outcome of each batch   each batch is always slightly different   I honestly thought everyone who baked knew this from experience     But you should all apologise to each other and set some serious ground rules for the future     And seriously  why would you want to share the birth of YOUR child with anyone but your wife  It s personal between the two of you and a real bonding moment for you  as a couple  with your child   Mom and aunt should see baby when you know both mum and baby are fine and have rested for a few hours   they re likely to be tired  exhausted  and emotional  Give them a few hours sleep before visitors and use that time to just hold your child or get some shut eye yourself as it will take a toll on you too   Good luck with your journey xxSo    did she add the secret ingredient to this recipe or is she holding out on us too I mean carrots are a natural product and can vary in moisture and sweetness  Maybe the carrots were just extra sweet or moist that day  Maybe the eggs were bigger or newer  Maybe the baking powder was old  Maybe it was mixed a minute longer   Expecting a baked good to be exactly the same or knowing why it isn’t is unreasonableI think you were just fine  One of my biggest pet peeves with family is their entitlement  No one is entitled to your new family’s special day OMG  I love a good carrot cake   NTA  Maybe a little overprotective  but I am grateful that you are  She is probably kind enough to just let it pass  even though she is confused and deeply hurt  It could be something really uncontrollable  like the relative humidity that day    Give her hugs from an old grandma  ❤️no offence but tell them the next time they ask your wife to make them to do them there selves as they have the recipe  and at the same time why are they getting a pregnant woman to do all this baking she is pregnant don t they have any compassion to let her rest while she is  also thanx for the recipe for carrot cake i will try it in next few daysThis made my blood boil a little bit  The reason they were lighter and fluffier is BECAUSE they were cupcakes  When you bake in a larger pan  it has to cook longer to cook through and will be a denser heavier cake  Shallow fill pans and cupcakes will always be fluffier because it takes less time to cook evenly  That s it  No recipe change  just the chemical reaction that happens inside the oven Wait  I was at that birthday party and this CANT be the recipe  What did she use instead of carrots   s  Both of you enjoy the new addition to your family  Don’t blink  It goes fast Cupcakes aside  your wife gets to decide who comes in the room and everyone else needs to accept it  NTA End of Story came here for AITA and got a carrot cake recipe  i say this is a win    NTA  especially bc you shared the recipe Have you heard of the water experiment   Where what you speak into at the water manifest when frozen    Love looks like a beautiful snowflake underneath a microscope when frozen and hate looks like shattered glass   This women you have described sounds like an angel and probably baked this cake cupcakes with love   They probably are just experiencing the love she puts into everything she does    That’s just my take on it I don’t know why the plan would ever include them in the hospital room  but to each their own    I think you went a little far and so did they  You’ll probably all laugh about it later NTA   Great that you stuck up for your wife  weirdly enough not many sons do that  especially against their mother    Also I m from the UK but what is baby food carrots  As in actual baby food It could ve been milion reasons  different mixing times  temp of the ingredients etc etc they should not obsess Your poor wife  I hate when you ask people to fucking drop something  and they just hold it tighter and start licking it   I’d be like “it’s clear to my wife and I  that you are having a hard time understanding her and it’s causing undue stress  until you can figure your behavior out   you’ll have to stay away ”If this is the biggest issue you have right now  consider yourself lucky  No sense letting cupcakes and a backhanded insult about those cupcakes take up so much room in your head  Just move on  Wife is going to be too busy and too tired to even care about cupcakes  You can bake any recipe a dozen times and get different results  Enjoy your new little one and let the cupcake debacle go  So not worth the energy ESH  Your mom and aunt are pushy obnoxious  You and your wife are being incredibly thin skinned  As your wife is very very pregnant  she has an excuse for it  You do not  You re picking a fight over something that is very unimportant    I would recommend reading this channel regularly for a few weeks to gain some perspective I’m a baker  I’m betting the difference was the carrots  One batch of carrots is not the same as another  Some are sweeter  some are crunchier  When you bake with fresh fruits and veggies  there will always be variation depending on the quality of the produce It looks like other commenters  beat  me to it  but baking is such a temperamental process that literally anything could have changed the final product  If it’s a matter of the product being lighter than usual  maybe your wife creamed the butter sugar longer or beat the eggs a bit more than usual without realizing it  This would mean she  did  do something different  but she is correct in that she didn’t intentionally change the recipe  It’s such a silly disagreement  but I agree that your mom and aunt should have taken your wife at her word that she didn’t alter the recipe  It’s refreshing to see a husband stand up for his wife like this  but it does feel like a bit of a over reaction  However  you know your family and the nuance of the situation best  I’m gonna go with NTA NTA  They should have let it go  When you told them you were upset by it  any normal person would have apologized Thank you for the recipe    NTA your baby you get to decide who is there  Congrats NTA  anyone who has gotten into baking at all knows there are so many variables aside from ingredients  their proportions  and the steps taken    If they were so concerned about the recipe itself  they would’ve taken your wife’s word and investigated into which variables may have affected the outcome  if there even was any difference instead of one deciding there was and the other convincing themselves into agreement   As it is  they chose to place your wife in a defensive position and effectively call her a liar  and pestering her while she’s very pregnant    I’m glad you were able to spot the disrespect  It wasn’t about the recipe for them NTA and well done for being there for your very pregnant wife  Watch out for other similar shenanigans once baby comes  My spidey senses are tingling on this one  Anyone that can t just say sorry to a very pregnant lady for basically calling her a liar    yeah  Might be more bad things to come  Keep firm on your boundaries  You don t want a new born baby being held  and snide comments coming out about cup cakes  Take care Bakery owner here  Ingredients being measured by volume rather than weight can result in drastically different products even if you follow the recipe exactly  For example  a cup of flour just scooped vs packed down have very different weights I love the idea of baby food  I love the taste of carrot cake but not the texture  that may fix it NTA  I really appreciate how OP has his wife’s back   You are an awesome partner  OPI just want to applaud you for having your wife s back like this  Your wife sounds charming NTA and please teach a class on how to support your wife  This is the very definition of setting a boundary about how your wife is to be treated There was just a light change that caused for the Cupcakes to taste better than before  The new ingredient that she added was her pregnancy   I don t know what s with us pregnant ladies  but our hands become magical when baking  At first  I thought that it was just a made up story from the old wife s tales  But during my pregnancy  baking cakes  cupcakes  or donuts have become so tasteful and so different from before being pregnant  My older sister has her own bakery in San Diego  CA  and the times she was pregnant  her cakes came out tasting differently and so good  So tell your wife that you found out what she did differently  It s not that you added something differently  but it s her pregnancy that made the cupcakes taste so different and good NTA and you have the best and most fun answers on Reddit that I have seen   NTA and So excited about the cupcake recipe I’m saving this recipe   calling it Reddit Carrot Cake  Will keep you postedThey took it to a weird place by failing to believe your wife or understanding that baking isn’t an EXACT science  The dew point outside can mess with the overall consistency between batches  as well as a myriad of other things like the age of the ingredients    She’s got enough going on with seriousness of the birth of y’alls baby than to deal with silly nonsense of none immediate family members at the hospital    Would I have told my mother “we’re not telling you the date until you apologize”  No…that part wasn’t really necessary  I just wouldn’t have told them the date at all and if they asked  just state that you weren’t having extra visitors during the hospital stayNTA Passive Aggressive people get seriously disconcerted when you call them on it  Repeatedly asking the same question and refusing to believe the answer is calling the responder a liar baking is so touchy  Chilling something for a few minutes or leaving it room temp while you multitask can change the turnout completely  Nothing she did    Secondly  if your sisters were on your side just over a cake recipe… I’m sure it ultimately goes deeper than that  Definitely don’t have them at the hospital  I hope your wife’s deliver goes smoothly   your baby is healthy   My delivery was absolutely horrible   primarily due to someone I had present for the birth  Your birth team can make or break the experience NTA   They went too far  and need to apologize Yummy  Making cupcakes this weekend for my dads 81 birthday  Thanks for recipe 😊Honestly anyone that wasn t at the conception shouldn t be there at the birth  An exception would be if the father has passed away or has to be out of the country for some reason  Unless your mother  aunt  sister  mother in law  or best friend is your doctor they are just in the way  They are an intrusion  Giving birth is messy and exhausting and should be private not a spectator event I didn t get along with my mother in law for a very long time   she did a lot of things to me that could be considered bullying  I was 15 when I met my husband he was 18  We dated for 6 yrs before getting married and have been married for 26 yrs now  I wish my husband would have stood up to his mom more in my defense  So I don t feel that you are being petty  Your mom and aunt should have just dropped it your wife is pregnant and pregnancy causes all kinds of hormones  I was relieved when my MIL was in Hawaii when I gave birth to our first son but she acted terrible when she got home tried to run over to our house from the airport at like 10 pm the night the got back   Sorry but we were always in bed by 9 or at the very least relaxing so it was a big deal  The best thing that a husband can do is support his wife   So with said your wife will look back yrs later and realize that you supported her when she really needed it  As a baker  what may have had an impact on the level of moisture on the cupcakes could have been the level of moisture in the air  or if the carrots were specially juicy for example I absolutely love how you had her back l  I don’t think you over reacted    You  the husband should get a gold star for taking up for your wife  That’s very important in a marriage  that you believe in her and respect her  There comes a time when a mother  and Aunt  should learn to respect your wife  If your wife makes you happy  they need to step back and respect your relationship and be happy for you  I am a mother and a mother in law  And I try to respect both my kids  their spouse and choices  because it was my and my husbands responsibility to raise our kids  now it’s time for them to take the reins  I will give them guidance when I am ask   I am very careful to not to push my ideas on them after they begin their adult life  I want my kids to respect us as their parents also  They know we are here if they need us In my area humidity factors into bakery items  I know when I make divinity the humidity needs to be extremely low or nonexistent Omg baby food instead of shredding carrots is genius  Carrot cake is my favorite  but I have Ehlers Danlos  with that extremely flexible fingers that tend to dislocate in the shredding process 😫  Thank s OP s wife  best wishes for baby and Momma s health Tell them the secret ingredient was Love this whole situation is pretty wack  I think it was something that blew up over something small but seems like you and your family have unresolved issues that maybe family therapy would be good for   on the other note I made the carrot cake and it is the best carrot cake I have ever had  I am an avid baker and have been for most of my life  not a professional baker by any means but it’s a hobby if mine similar to your wife I do it in the side  I think i might even add these carrot cupcakes to my list for my wedding  everyone should make these   Like people said you can make the same recipe every time the same and it will be slightly different  your family needs to chill out or bake their own desserts  With all do respect  At the risk of being  that  person  the phrase is  With all due respect  You’re having this big of a blowout over a cake recipe  Christ  what a stupid thing to get upset over  You all could have said  “maybe it was the humidity in the air” or “maybe it was the hand of God on this batch”  You have to know when it’s more important to keep a relationship and when it’s more important to be right ESH  Honestly  everyone keeps escalating this until now it’s a family feud over a stupid bunch of cupcakes  Everyone should apologize to each other for letting it get out of control and chalk up the taste difference to humidity or something YTA for turning an annoyance into a major family drama  You could have communicated more effectively without going to the threatening dramatics  Geez   I get major ego need to prove you re a knight in shining armor to feed it kind of vibes here  Yikes  😬This whole thing is silly  If you had not inserted yourself in this  it would have gone away  Now you are telling your family they won’t be told when your wife goes into labor  IMO you owe your family an apology for blowing this up  And maybe you could have told your wife not to worry about the recipe I bake also  Are you guys aware that temperature and humidity affect baked goods  I use the exact same recipes and they have different textures depending on the air they bake and cool in “I know what she was thinking because we communicate”   This is the AH move  I adore my partner and he is often right about my thoughts and actions but NOT ALWAYS  The law of averages says at some point  there will be a swing and a miss    Even if you nail the mind reading for the next 5 years straight   actually  especially the longer you nail the mind reading   the higher the chances you’ll slip up    She may not want her mind read all the time  She may want time to process and act on her own  And you guys are going to have a lot less time to make quick decisions with an infant around    Just be sure you are honoring HER voice    Sounds like this time you were in sync with her but it won’t always be that way  Is there REALLY space for her to speak on her own  in her own time    Just slow down a tick  papa bear  But otherwise you’re all good  Those ladies need good  strong  tall  wide boundariesYTA only because you and the phrase “with all due respect” have some catching up to due Any baker will tell you daytime humidity and temps in the room can change how baked goods come out  Pro bakers adjust water amounts and ingredients accordingly   You re all being idiots Life in adult kindergartenFor me it’s always bizarre that people feel entitled to be at a birth in the first place  It’s not a spectator sport and my MIL  let alone her sister  certainly wouldn’t be on my invite list    That said  I think dangling threats of this magnitude in order to win a generally petty argument seems a bit extreme  I wouldn’t get in the habit of casually weaponizing access to your child as a bargaining chip whenever your mother upsets you  It’s just not a healthy dynamic  I understand some people need to cut off access to their kids in extreme scenarios but this ain’t it   I also think putting yourself in the middle of this argument made it bigger than it was  And they’re right  they didn’t call her a liar  they simply insisted on repeating their experience of it tasting different which infers your wife may have done something different  Were they annoying and should have shut up about it  Sure  But that kind of pushy old lady repeating themselves thing is common and not the same as labeling someone as dishonest  It’s more a passive aggressive way of saying “are you sure  Think really hard  Couldn’t there be something you’re forgetting ” Yes it’s annoying but there’s far more productive ways to shut that shit down than calling them liars and demanding apologies   But now your wife has little choice but to have your back or she’ll make it even messier if she calls you out for being a drama queen  In the future I wouldn’t get in the habit of demanding apologies for other people when they didn’t even ask for one    All around it feels like no one won here and you did a great job of making thing a good deal messier than they needed to be    It’s totally fine for your wife to not want them at the birth but that should have been an entirely separate conversation from this cake debate  Muddling the two was not the mature move here NTA  Your aunt took it an extreme  Your mom should never have been involved  she should have stayed completely out of it  Does your wife have obsessive compulsive disorder  Since she keeps going back to recipe and rereading it  She may need to see a therapist to learn how to handle these situations easier  With a child it may become more extreme if your mom or aunt says she should be doing something different than she is  You may have to go LC with mom and aunt if they don t back off while your wife learns how to handle people like them YTA  They didn t call her a liar  The cupcakes were different  They liked them  They complimented her  They want to know what she did differently  even if only the eggs were at room temperature or something  Something WAS different  If your wife was so certain  she wouldn t have questioned herself  I mean what do you expect  for them to pretend the cupcakes were the same as always so they don t get excommunicated from the baby  It sounds like North Korea at your house    Your wife could have responded the way many of the redditors did  that something could have been different  but she didn t  It was just a flat no  which to be honest with you sir  sounds passive aggressive on her part  I think your wife may be one of those sugar sweet passive aggressive types that are so common  particularly in the South  Anytime someone challenges her she clutches her pearls and acts  hurt  and claims ignorance  And here you come in and get to play big man  You both sound annoying I m sorry  Families are complicated  Try to mend fences even if it means you build the fences higher  It is not a bad idea to have it just be the two of you at the hospital especially with all this extra drama going on  Good luck with the birth and congratulations It always fascinates me how families do this to themselves over the stupidest Fucking shit   I don’t understand why you would wants MIL’s and Aunts IL at the hospital for the birth anyway   NTA  Childbirth is hard and intense  No one should be anywhere near the birthing mother if their presence brings her anxiety or tension  This is important for her process of laboring  delivering  and then bonding with the baby  You are right to protect her space and energy I d say soft YTA but not for why you may think  If they re saying your wife must have done something differently  they re not accusing her of lying  it s 100% possible your wife accidentally changed something and doesn t recall  This whole assuming she s a liar thing is a bit baseless  all they re saying is it doesn t taste the same  Could be a ton of reasons   Maybe she put the wrong amount of sugar or some ingredient without realizing  They even said they preferred it and just wanted to know to recreate it   It seems blown put of proportion                             Post Title  AITAH for being mad at autistic step daughter for not helping in any way with family chores content  First of all let me point out that I love my whole family and my step daughter  14  and step son  13  are a part of this family just as much as my biological daughter  My girlfriend  41  has since then gotten our own daughter 1  together and she is a little beacon of happiness shining and brightening everyones day   most of the time  I know that getting a newborn into the family has taken a lot out of me and my girlfriend s time that can no longer be used on the big kids  and we have solved this in the best way we possibly can by splitting us up  One does something with the big kids while the other one gets to be with our youngest daughter    Last year our oldest got diagnosed with autism   mind you that we have known this for a long time  She is incredibly booksmart  but lacks severely in social interaction skills  Her mind just works in a different way than ours  and that s totally okay  When her way of viewing the world doesn t fit how the world actually works she can have a bit of a melt down  and now that she is in her teenage years things have gotten quite hard for her  Finding oneself in that age is hard enough as it is  but with a diagnosis of autism on top of that  it must be extremely tough  While she is extremely booksmart she has a pretty high learning curve  and is not self sufficient in any way  Not because she couldn t but because she has her head in the clouds as one might say  Her mind is going 200MP H thinking of something else than whatever she is told to do  This makes it frustrating for everyone as she forgets what she is doing  and is extremely slow in doing the things she is told    Now the problem has started recently with me starting full time work  I don’t have the same time to clean the house as I did before  and both my girlfriend and I are working full time and when we get home we are caring for a small child while we need to clean up the house  and prepare meals  Me and my girlfriend agree that it should and will never be the teenager s issue that we decide to get another child  that is for me and my girlfriend to bear   When all of this is said the problem is cleaning up after oneself and helping when it is needed  Not because I tell you too  but because you re a part of this household  An example could be my step daughter making a cup of hot chocolate  She grabs a cup  pour in the milk  adds cocoa powder  puts it in the microwave  takes the cup and leaves for her room  Now this sounds fine  but the only steps in this process that doesn t make a mess that I have to clean up is literally finding the cup and milk  When she adds the cocoa powder she spills the powder  When she stirs the chocolate drink she spills on the countertable  When she puts it in the microwave she spills on the way over there because she fills it to the brim  When she microwaves it spills inside because it s filled to the brim and boils over  Then she takes it to the room and I m left with the cleaning  sometimes even putting the milk back in the fridge   So  As one might figure out from my description above this annoys me  When you confront her with the typical you forget to clean up after yourself  she either freaks out or just flat out ignores you  She doesn t even move her head away from her screen  No matter the time and space you try to talk with her she gets mad  and I m losing my patience with her  I know that she is in her teens and that is part of the explanation  but our step son moans and kicks  but he does it   she doesn t    I feel like an asshole because she has autism and has a lot on her plate  but it’s starting to feel like she just ignores you on purpose because she knows she can get away with it and manipulates you this way  Because sometimes she can do everything  and behaves like a completely normal teen  She bakes cookies for her friends and cleans up after herself and we come home to a house that looks exactly like we left it  So you re left with a feeling that you know she can clean up after herself but chooses not to   Now before I got shot down for her autism  We have been in constant dialog with psychologists and read countless books  We love our daughter and we want the best for her   but it’s hard sometimes  I know sometimes she is just done for the day and her battery is used for the day  but there is indication for when that happens   So reddit  Am I an asshole Comments  Hiding behind autism is just going to damage her in the long run  it s a convenient out for her  I understand autism is a spectrum  but my buddy has three kids  two of which are on the spectrum  one is high functioning the other isn t  Oddly enough they both have no issue cleaning up after themselves     Aside from one that won t interact with anything that has a Styrofoam like feel  he hates it and it deeply upsets him    To me the fact that she s capable and willing  without being told  to clean up after herself when her friends are there shows she understands the negative connotations of being a slob and doesn t want them to know see her that way  When she s by herself she hides behind autism  seems like she s just lazy and the autism  excuse has given her a powerful get out of jail free card   She s a moody teen  we ve all been that at one point  and we ve all dealt with them to  what s important is reinforcing cleaning up after yourself  Does your partner have your back in this NTA  It seens that this is just emotional overload of your teenage child not picking up after themselves and you don t have a lot of emotinal bandwidth left because you have a smaller child too  and we can t control our feelings only what we do with them  It s ok to be upset in a situation you feel like you can t control    I was diginosed with high functioning autism as an older teen adult  I was a senior in high school  And one thing that my mother really focused on was to not allow it to be an excuss for me to not act in a  precentable  fashion  I m from the south  so image is everything    Anyway  I m not going to lie it was a strugle and still is but you want to raise a functioning human being that can live on her own and be a productive memver of society without you and you know what  That is a hard thing to do harder because of the autism but not impossible NAH  My DH is not ND and HE can t clean up after himself  But I don t know how to get her to do it NAH  It might also be that she’s blind to the mess if it’s part of her routine vs something unusual  cookies for friends   It took me moving out and living on my own for a while to actually register messes I made without a reminder because my brain is very bad at noticing it if there’s a distraction    She definitely needs to learn how to clean up after herself and do chores  Is there any way you can help her “loop” it into the task  Clean up while the hot chocolate is microwaving  or something is cooking  etc  She might be also reacting negatively to being interrupted in the middle of different tasks more than the reminder to clean itself  You could try having a scheduled time for regular chores  so it becomes an externally enforced habit to clean after dinner homework some other stable point in the day NTA  It is vital that people  especially those with disabilities  learn how to become and remain independent  If she is capable of cleaning  then she should be expected to do so  I wouldn t bully her about it  but I wouldn t allow her diagnosis to be used as an excuse for her behavior  Continue counseling Nta   be clear with expectations   Aka you wipe the bench after making your drink  And if they don t they get reminded  Good luck NAH It must be so frustrating nta  not in any way   I would start taking electronics away  I am autistic as well  when I was her age I went to school  came home  cooked and then did laundry cleaned because I had an ailing parent   autism is not an excuse and autistics need punishment just like others  I d make a list of things you want to do and tell her if xyz isn t done then you take her   screen   I d also tell her to not ignore you when you speak to her  this is not a good habit to indulge                            Post Title  AITA for NOT being upset that my wife  cheated  content  So  a bit of background   I was raised by hippy parents I guess and I think that really rubbed off on my when I was then dating  So I had a very  free love  attitude to dating and sex  I slept around a bit  had a few one night stands  Was involved in polyarmorous and open relation ships   I think I ve described myself as  aggressively pansexual  in my idea of a perfect world  having sex would be as socially acceptable as hand shakes  I d happily have sex with pretty much anyone I d know   BUT I know this isn t the norm  I m well adjusted socially and I have a high degree of empathy  I think  and I understand that most people aren t like that  So I am happy being platonic friends with people  And even if I m very sexually attracted to someone  if they re not interested in me like that I m still happy to be friends   Then in 2015 I met my now wife  She wasn t like that  She was purely monogomous and felt that sex was very personal and intimate  We met each other through friends of friends and we vibed really well and enjoyed hanging out with each other  and then when we were chilling at her house one day watching an Avengers movie  and her housemate had to leave and it was just us on the couch  one thing lead to another and we slept together   After talking about where we were at we decided to stay as friends  but we just liked hanging out with each other too much and then it happened again  And we had another talk but I really liked her and I figured if I could do monogomy with anyone  it would be her  So I made the decision  Monogamy it was  And  well  We grew together and apart from the odd  you know  craving for diversity I was super happy  and I feel like I was falling in love  so I proposed because I realised that I would choose spending the rest of my life with her over polyamory   Got married last year  living our happily ever after  Until last weekend   So My wife went to a work function  originally she planned to be home no later than 10  but then just before 10 she messaged me saying she was staying out and will crash at a friend s house  I didn t think it was a big deal and said  Ok see you tomorrow love you    She got back the next day and she was acting a bit  I dunno  noticeably a bit reserved and withdrawn  Figured she might ve been hung over  made her a cup of tea and asked if she needed anything  she shook her head and said that she just wanted some alone time  I thought something might have happened and said  Ok  I ll be here if you need to talk   She didn t look at me and I was really worried that something awful might have happened   She kept being withdrawn over the weekend and I was really worried that something awful might have happened  and kept running through horrific scenarios in my head like maybe she was assaulted or maybe like a work friend had died horrifically and she witnessed it   On the monday she went to work  I work from home  without a word and came home and was still not talking to me  that was when I started putting my foot down  I wanted to respect her need for space but I was also extremely worried about her  and it wasn t characteristic for her to push me away  we always felt like a unit  like no matter what we were always on each others side   So I said to her  I need to know what s going on  Please  this isn t like you to shut me out   And that s when she burst into tears and told me that they went clubbing and she met some younger guy who was really hot and they danced for a while and she got really drunk and she ended up going back to his place and having sex   At this point I laughed and was like  Oh honey  I was worried that something horrible had happened   and then she looked at me like I had just shot her dog and said  You don t care   I said  It s not that I don t care I just don t think of these things the same way you do    She claims that I have never cared about our relationship and asks me if I ever cheated on her and I said that I didn t but she s being so hard on herself and upset  Like if she made a mistake she s punished herself more than I would ever want to about it  and also she was incredibly drunk and decision making when you re drinking isn t that bad   I don t want to share this with friends and family to get their perspectives because it s quite a private thing  She says I m an asshole for not caring  But like  she s just punishing herself and I still love her  Am I really the asshole here  It just strikes me as incredibly possessive to be angry at her about it when I ve always had this kind of  free love  mentality Comments  You re NTA  but it bothers me that she thought this was a huge betrayal and still went through with it To be honest I think you should be mad  but not so much because she cheated but because of how she views cheating   You’re a free love polyamorous person who chose to be monogamous because of a specific person  But she’s not  She believes sex is intimate  She believes you’re supposed to remain faithful and despite that she cheated  She took something that might make her end her relationship if it happened to her and she did it to you NTA   I had a similar issue with an ex girlfriend  She was upset that I didn t get upset more  For some reason  if I wasn t pissed off she talked to another guy she thought I didn t care    This sounds like your wife has some self esteem issues and jealousy issues  She also doesn t seem as upset that she broke HER most sacred vow  she s upset with YOU that YOU aren t upset at her  You may want to wait until she has calmed down some and sit down with her to talk  Ask her straight up  If I had cheated  what would you do  If you would kick me out and demand divorce then I m expecting you will leave now and sign the papers when I send them  If you would be willing to work things out we can start from there     If she is so invested in you two only having sex with each other that nothing else matters then she won t let this go  She won t be able to move past it I think you’re missing an important part  You might not value monogamy as much  but she does  And she totally disregarded that to sleep around  Obviously NTA  but I don’t think you’re looking at this right  She’s done something really bad  from her POV  and you shouldn’t be so relaxed about it What I love about OP is that I have heard multiple guys say the have this attitude towards sex and they want open relationships etc  But when their partner has sex with other guys they get offended  OP kudos for being honest with your feelings  Of course NTA  And it is really fortunate that you can move past this  She kind of sounds like an asshole though  Because if monogamy is such a big deal for her  why did she betray your trust  I don’t understand what she wished to happen  She should consider herself lucky  Most people wouldn’t tolerate what OP seems to be ok withNTA  She seems upset to find out that you have the exact attitude to sex you always claimed to have  I am assuming you were always upfront about that with her   My first instinct was to have a little empathy for her realisation you don t view sex as important and personal as she does  and that I could see why she would then be thinking  the reason he doesn t care that I ve slept with someone else is because he never saw our sexual relationship as personal and special  and he s also slept with other people since we started dating     But then I realised  your perspective isn t a secret  It would be like a vegetarian getting upset that their partner they knew full well eats meat  wasn t upset that the vegetarian slipped up and ate meat   I would say if you did want to keep this relationship  you could approach this from the angle that you know from her perspective that she betrayed you and risked your entire relationship  and it hurts that she did that  For example if I knew someone I loved believed in curses  I would be upset they put a curse on me even though I know curses aren t real and nothing will happen  The fact they believe it and were willing to do that to me would be hurtful   She also may be thinking you will use her cheating as a reason to sleep with other people yourself  I don t have any idea how to deal with that one Of course you are NTA  Maybe you’ll get upset later  Who knows     I think most people fear affairs because there’s a chance that the person will leave you or bring home a STD or even have an accidental pregnancy   Your perspective is unique   I guess you should just continue to talk to her and tell her that you absolutely care but you just happen to understand the circumstances  Reassure her that you expect that this wouldn’t happen again and have no plans to cheat NTA  because that s just how you were raised  and those are your values    I will add  though  that she didn t  just meet a guy and accidentally sleep with him   her cheating was premeditated  She texted you and told you she was going to stay out  She already knew she was going to go home with someone else  For her to be  strictly monogamous   she crossed a lot of her own boundaries to cheat   She s not projecting her guilt onto you  She s trying to make you the bad guy for her cheating  and it s upsetting her more that you re not upset about it  I would seriously contemplate the value of your marriage because I think this is a slippery dynamic that is liable to change in the future  She ll probably continue to  cheat  and when you don t care  she ll try to do something that will make you care  Edit  She IS projecting her guilt onto you  sorry bad typoNTA   She feels guilty  because she betrayed the person she loves and   more severe for her   her own values  People don t like the feeling of not living up to their own standards  It sounds like she needs some kind of retribution redemption to handle her fault  By not making a fuss you didn t give her any retribution feeling so she can t feel redeemed  So she lashes out   There are two options  1  Make a fuss so she can eventually feel like she made up for her fault by  suffering  your anger or distance or whatever  2  Talk to her about your boundaries  When would you feel cheated  Although you have a Laissez faire view of sex you sure can think of scenarios where you would feel cheated  Maybe if she got pregnant or a STD  Maybe if she told you years later about her cheating  Maybe if it was a regular thing  Maybe it isn t sex but if she would share here feelings with another person  Make her understand that you care for the relationship with her  that you love her  that have boundaries in this relationship  they re just not at the same spot as hers   I think option 2 is far superior und more adult  but it s your choice  It could be that she still needs that redemption feeling after that talk She is the cheater  but has twisted that around to be mad at you  When she comes in tonight   tell her to she is a disgusting  sorry example of a wife  and promptly kick her out  Maybe that will cheer her up The audacity to cheat and then blame YOU for not caring about the relationship  NTA  I d be considering divorce if I was you  maybe not because of the cheating itself  but how she s trying to make you the bad guy You re NTA for actually believing what you believe  but you should take her betrayal more seriously  Not because you care if she sleeps with someone else  but because SHE cares if she sleeps with someone else  Her betraying her own moral code is a real problem  and a sign that something is wrong  Her blaming you for not holding her accountable to a morality that you don t share  but agreed to abide by for her sake  is an even bigger red flag  Time for couples counseling NTA  but bro  I don’t think you and your girlfriend are compatible    And besides that  what happens if when she sneaks around and lies and betrays you in a way that doesn’t involve sex Well well  it seems your wife isn’t “purely monogamous” after all  Maybe discuss opening the relationship  then she can bone young hot dudes guilt free  Her directing her anger at you instead of herself for cheating is a cheap move to not have to deal with her own feelings  NTA NTA  The absolute audacity NTA  so lemme get this straight  she s the one that wants monogamy and values the sanctity of sex between 2 ppl  pretty much force that belief onto you  then cheats on you and gets mad you don t get mad by it  the gaslighting is insane to me lmao  huuge red flag  remember you didn t ask this of her  she asked this of you and couldn t even remain faithful for a couple of years  tread carefully OP My parents raised me similarly but I prefer monogamy but I can understand the way you re thinking about sex  But what I can t understand is why you aren t upset that she  cheated   Not because of the sex but because in polyamory honesty and trust are really important  And she lied to you  broke your arrangements and now is pissed at you  That to me is really disrespectful and I don t know if I would want to stay with a hypocrite that blames me for their actions even more so when they then tell me I don t love them  Because the same way you see sex as casual she does not  which means for her it was betraying you in a huge way and she knew that and she did it anyway  NTAYou have a pretty unusual perspective  but it works for you  I was touched about how you would care more about her being assaulted than cheating  maybe a low bar perhaps    I would reassure her that you’re not leaving her and that this doesn’t mean you want to open up the relationship in response  as long as that’s true    She is perhaps worried this is the end of the road or that you will cheat on her   I would advise she see a therapist to work through what happened  her guilt  her feelings toward you “not caring” etc I think the bigger problem here is that she is turning this into something she can blame OP for  not caring  That s a huge red flag  and she s trying to shift her guilt  NTA @OP NTA but bro  you need to consider this with more seriousness  She cheated on you  You viewing it as ok or not ok doesn t matter  To her  sex is intimate part of relationship and she shared tha intimacy with someone else just because they were hot    I know you are a free loving kind of guy but you gotta understand the gravity of this situation   Even poly marriages have rules of intimacy that you don t cross  If crossed  it s considered cheating    Would your wife let you share intimacy with other women NTA  because you have the views that you have re sex  so it isn’t upsetting you currently    You probably shouldn’t have been as good natured as you seem to have been  as your wife is right  it does seem like you don’t care about it  and by extension about your relationship with her   And while I think you are right in your attitude towards sex  your attitude towards the breach of trust  you trusted her to behave responsibly  to act in the manner she always has  and in the manner to which you have changed your lifestyle into   that of somebody in a monogamous relationship  and the disrespect she showed your relationship by acting how she did  are problematic and will likely be as much the cause of the end of your relationship as her behaviour  Think back to your open and poly relationships   there were rules to be followed so that everyone knows that they are loved  cared for  trusted and respected  and when they were broken the relationship suffered and in most cases probably ended  Oh man  that feels messed up  She’s mad at you  she “cheated on you” but your polyamory kind of shields you from feeling bad  And you were glad she wasn’t hurt    You are not the ass  she is  NTA  I can’t believe some people think you are the problem  This would drive me crazy  you were just glad she wasn’t attacked  I’d be happy to be poly  my wife would fill unwell if we really tried it  she’d say she’d not be able to live with herself Sounds like she wants a divorce and you ruined her plans by not being mad Fake  Too much narrative  direct quotes  dramatic twists  These events didn’t occurMan  this is such a rollercoaster  She  should  feel awful  You  should  feel angry or upset  Seems like you’re both a bit…different NTA  This feels like  probably subconscious  deflection on her part   i e  she cheats  you have an atypical reaction   aren t mad  she redirects her negative emotions into being angry at you instead of being angry upset disgusted with herself for cheating   Side note   you should fix your headline  Your wife didn t  cheat  on you  implying it wasn t real cheating   She cheated  no inverted commas  The fact that you re ok with it because you re polyamorous doesn t change that   she made a promise to you to be monogamous   she broke that promise  You should be mad  She didn t give you the respect of coming to you   saying  hey OP  I ve been thinking that maybe I am willing to explore an open polyamorous relationship  I love you but I have a person in mind I d like to start a sexual relationship with   can we discuss this   She just cheated  And didn t come clean of her own volition either   only when you told her you knew something had happened   demanded an answer  Her lying is also incredibly disrespectful of you as her spouse  Again  you    should    be mad I think people are glossing over an aspect of your wife’s behavior here  She didn’t just cheat with a guy she met at the club  At 10pm  she knew she wasn’t coming home for the night and lied about it  This isn’t “oops  I hooked up with a guy at the bar”  this was premeditated cheatingSounds like maybe she is the one who doesn’t care about you  Since she’s the one hung up on sex being intimate between two people bla bla and was still able to cheat  Fyi just cause your drunk doesn’t mean your not yourself all alcohol does is lower your inhibition it doesn’t change who you are as a person  Idk in this case it would be the lying that bothered me  I told my husband I’d be up for an open marriage if he ever wanted someone other than me I’d rather know about it I hate lies  Sex is sex it can mean different thing between different people love is something different all together  NTAWeirdThis reads like total fiction     NTA  I myself live happily in a non monigamus relationship for 10 years without myself having  had outside sexual relationships with the exception of a few trials with threesomes  they are simply not my cup of tea and I did not have the urge for anything more than playful discussions or appreciation of beauty from a distance   In contrast to most comments I saw I do not think the wife is  a piece of shit   I think the problem is that she learned something about herself she can at the moment not  yet  integrate into her   self image  She did something she never thought of having the inclination to do  alcohol may have lowered the barriers but in essence she has to face the reality that  she is not fully monogamous   OPs reaction was also against the societal script she expected  in addition to all the tropes of sexual fidelity to be the top priority  and the realisation that sexual jealousy may not be universal and not a measure for strength of a relationship   Nothing is sure at this point but I do not think all hope is lost for the relationshipNTA for not being mad  but a bit TA for laughing when she told you  I totally get that it was a laugh of relief that it wasn t something YOU find serious  but it clearly means a lot to her  I think it s a good idea to sit down with her and fully explain your reaction  and talk about the decisions you ve both made within the relationship  so she can hopefully have a more clear understanding of your perspective  and she can feel like you re taking her  confession  seriously  And this way  you will gain a better understanding of why she feels she cheated    It could be as simple as getting caught up in the biology of attraction and her fears are just based around how society views sex in general  OR it could be that there is something underlying that needs to be addressed  If it s biology  you ll need to talk about how you handle yourself when you ve come across people you re attracted to  don t give specific examples  this is DANGEROUS TERRITORY   so she can understand that you have a way to handle yourself and understand WHY she doesn t need to fear you cheating    Your second paragraph could have been written by me  but I ve also been in the position of your wife  I m open to a poly lifestyle now that I understand it and have a better sense of how to be in a plural relationship with safe boundaries  but my initial introduction to it was through an ex who put me through hell  emotionally cheating all over the place  Make it very clear that that s not how you would operate even if one day she decided she wanted to try it officially   I know it s a lot  but ultimately  she s looking for reassurance  She wants to know that you care about her as deeply as she cares about you  and it can be tricky when the exchange rate isn t clearly defined  Good luck  I hope it all works out so you re both happyOh  she s an emotional child and you need to go be with an adult NTA  but it s extremely assholish of her to not only cheat on you  but then also get mad at you for not being mad at her betrayal of your trust    She claims that I have never cared about our relationship  that s rich coming from a cheater lol  have you asked her the same thing recently  ask her why she can accuse you of not caring about the relationship when she s the one who started this whole incident with her actions  she herself said that being monogamous is very important  that sex is intimate  and then she s the one who broke her commitment   even if you aren t mad that she slept with someone else  you should be mad that she betrayed your trust  you both need marriage counseling I think the reason your wife is upset is that you never actually became invested in monogamy despite agreeing to it  This implies you and your wife have fundamentally different views on relationships and she now realizes the extent of this incompatibility  As you wife sees things   she lied to you  she went against her promise  and she betrayed you  She doesn t understand why you don t care  Assuming you want to try to save your relationship  you need to tell her why you still love her and want to stay with her  because she cannot understand why you don t care    it s incompatible with her view of what romantic love is and it doesn t seem like you made an active effort to help her understand    I also wonder why you aren t annoyed at all  By agreeing to be monogamous  you scarified a part of yourself for you wife  She couldn t honor that agreement and yet  you don t seem to care about her hypocrisy  I think you should ask yourself why OP  how do you feel about being lied to about “crashing at a friend’s house” She violated her own standards  not yours  She has no right to demand that you react like she would  and it takes some HUGE balls to both cheat on you and then get all pissy and act like the victim here  She s a huge   She really cheated and is the mad one cuz ur not mad what kinda shit is this 🤣🤣I don t think you re an asshole according to your beliefs  My question to you is   What now   Don t you think your wife should have a pregnancy test as well as STD testing  Seeing how you are okay with her cheating on you  does that mean you re now in an open marriage  Good for the goose  Good for the gander she cheated on you  and thinks YOU are the AH   she s a real keeper No you should only be upset if you are held to a different standardNTA  I think it’s totally possible that your relaxed attitude about sex has  ahem  rubbed off on her over the years knowing you  and maybe that upsets her  Perhaps what she’s actually upset about is that she’s coming to the realization that sex isn’t necessarily this magical  sacred thing between two people that she was taught to believe it is  It sounds like this is more about what she’s going through than anything you did  Couples therapy with an open minded therapist would probably be a good idea Maybe she really feels like she fucked up  And she kept blaming herself for ruining the relationship for the last days  She started to hate herself and what she did  She was alone with this feelings  And now you laugh into her face  after she did something that she feels terrible about  Yeah  I am pretty sure she is confused and hurt  She feels already like shit and you laughed it off   So not get emotional brain gets all confused and she thinks  Did he cheat on me  Doesn’t he care  Does he even love me  Will he ask for an open relationship now  Do I have to live with him fucking with other people  Is it over now  Will my life with him be like ever before    NTA   But people react different  She is the AH for cheating  but not for her emotions after her confession  I am glad you are not hurt  but for her the world is spinning and she feels like she is losing everything NTA  But it definitely sounds like you guys gotta have a serious talk about how your relationship will function moving forward cause she’s probably feeling really confused about your reactionNTA  my thought is to tell her clearly that sex for you is not a defining factor of love and commitment  You truly feared something horrible had happened and that you were worried sick  You re open to helping her explore deep commitment that doesn t require exclusive sex  And that you re not angry because you d feel the same if she had dinner or sex with someone else  She comes home to you and you come home to her  you share the ups and downs of daily life  pain and sorrow  joy and laughter  Far too many people think of sex in a puritanical way  Here is an opportunity to broaden her thinking  She expected holy hell and is getting love and acceptance and doesn t know what to do with that  This is a real opportunity for growth and increased dimension in your relationship All I can say is that this is the first instance and you not reacting to it to preserve your self respect is only going to make this a repeat occurrence  Someone who says they value monogamy and all the associated jazz does not break their own moral code  And blaming alcohol is so stupid  Your wife is an adult  She could have chosen to not drink  She could’ve chosen to not cheat  But she did  And instead of looking inwards  she’s blamed you for not caring and the alcohol for her own lack of control  This is what you need to address  It’s wonderful that you’re being a supportive husband  but that doesn’t mean you get yourself steamrolled  You just need to look at similar stories and see what happens in the future  Usually ends in a divorce with you being blamed for not caring and then you start wondering where it went wrong  Being supportive is fine but to condone cheating is not Nta but she is  She disrespected you and your marriage  Even if you are ok with it  she thought it was a huge earth shattering betrayal  and still did it Aside from what others have said about her just having a different perspective on sex  consider this  You both vowed agreed to be faithful to each other  You don t care about sleeping around at all  but you SHOULD care that the vows you made to each other were broken  She lied to you and broke the promises of the relationship  Then she was punishing you with a silent treatment  then got mad at YOU for not being upset about it  Honestly it doesn t sound like EITHER of you take your vows all that seriously and should probably sit down and talk about it  You view sex as a normal  casual thing but I am willing to bet trusting your wife is something you DO take seriously You dont have as high of an empathy as you think you do lolNTA  but your outlook on sex is destructive at the very least NTA but you should still be upset because even if sex isn’t a big deal to you  she still broke a foundational agreement in your relationship and one that for her  would be catastrophic  It’s worth understanding that this was a betrayal of your relationship  even if you personally don’t feel that way about sex  Your relationship is still currently built on a mutual agreement and trust NTA  I do feel like there s more going on for her though  She s strictly monogamous and finds sex a very personal and intimate act  but then she sleeps with a random guy     She wanted a bigger reaction out of you for a reason  Maybe it s projection and she thinks a huge angry reaction is a way to show you care  or she was intentionally trying to hurt youWith 700 ish comments already I doubt you re going to see this  but just in case  definitely NTA   I think your wife s reaction may be a coping mechanism  From your description it sounds like she was feeling very guilty and having difficulty dealing with the implication of her actions    Your response probably caught her off guard  and then before she was even aware of it her brain whipped up an interpretation to let her avoid dealing with her feelings of guilt and personal failure  She grabbed onto that with both arms  metaphorically speaking  and is holding onto it in a desperate attempt to stay emotionally afloat   I don t think this was in any way a conscious decision on her part  but she ll probably hold on to it for a while just to avoid coming to terms with her behaviour and the massive mistake she made  relative to her own sense of morality     If you can find a somewhat gentle way to shift her focus back to herself and her own actions  while ensuring her emotional safety and security at the same time  you might be able to de escalate things Dawg  you can  not  be angry and somehow people will still try to crucify you for it  The fact that you didn t respond the way the majority of this commonly placed  pathetic society would and just shrugged it off because it s not that big of a deal  then you got punished for it     Not gonna echo the whole  leave now  sentiment that most of Reddit does  but I would give your wife some serious choices to review and one of them would be Cognitive Behavioral Therapy  because she clearly has a problem   Additionally  you re right in that it is very possessive to be angry as it doesn t pertain to any sensible notion of actions we  as humans  take  But people will go off on you for saying it because they don t have healthy perspectives of what boundaries really are  think your actions dictate their emotions  and will use anything you do as ammunition to filter into their funnel of  you did this  for you  but think about me  mentality  Evident by your wife being angry with you    for not being angry with her    that she  emphasis on this  cheated   NTA  Not the Asshole  Nowhere near being the asshole   Good luck man 🌌 Am I really the asshole here   ESH  Let me explain   Your wife sucks for obvious reasons  monogamy was very important to her  you changed your entire lifestyle to accommodate that  and then she cheated on you    You suck because of this    So I said to her  I need to know what s going on  Please  this isn t like you to shut me out   And that s when she burst into tears and told me that they went clubbing and she met some younger guy who was really hot and they danced for a while and she got really drunk and she ended up going back to his place and having sex    At this point I laughed and was like  Oh honey  I was worried that something horrible had happened   and then she looked at me like I had just shot her dog and said  You don t care   I said  It s not that I don t care I just don t think of these things the same way you do    This is the dumbest possible response you could have had  no matter what your personal feelings on the subject are  Even though you have told her with your   actions   over the last 8 years that you have made monogamy an important part of your life with her  what you just told her with your   words   right now was  I don t give a shit about monogamy   She was attempting to confess a serious breach of her own personal ethics to you and you treated it like it was nothing  Do you have any idea how jarring that had to be for her  Right now it doesn t matter how YOU feel about monogamy  the point of this confession was how SHE feels about monogamy  and you blew it off  Any sane person would assume that you are fine with yourself cheating as well at this point  for starters   Secondly if someone comes to you and is very very upset about a thing they did that you don t personally consider a big deal  the proper response isn t  who cares   it s  I see  we should talk about this     She claims that I have never cared about our relationship  You see how your response led her directly to that conclusion  right     She says I m an asshole for not caring   Yeah  you kind of are  Look  here s the thing  I am not going to tell you that you need to get angry about a thing you are not angry about  because you feel how you feel  I am also not here to tell you that your wife who cheated on you is the victim in this situation  because she sure as hell isn t   What I   am   here to tell you is that if something is a huge giant traumatic deal to your spouse the proper response to it is not  I don t care   Even if you don t care you should still at least discuss the giant thing that s been eating her up for days  She clearly cares about it a great deal and clearly equates monogamy with love  You don t  that s fine  you do you  But knowing that monogamy is a huge deal to her and she broke it means you need to acknowledge that this is a big deal to her  not laugh it off and go back to watching tv  I m a little gobsmacked I need to explain that   Then there s the drinking component to this  She herself says she was very drunk  Maybe she felt like she wasn t fully in control of the situation  Maybe she felt like this guy got her liquored up enough to where she wasn t able to make an informed decision about consent  Maybe the reason I keep having to say  maybe  is because you asked her exactly zero followup questions and blew the whole thing off despite how clearly upset she was  Are you starting to get the big picture here  yet   Bottom line your partner wanted to talk about something that really upset them   The fact that the thing that really upset her was largely her own doing  unless someone plied her with drinks until she was blacking out  is not directly relevant at this time   She was upset  she wanted to talk  you blew it off NTA  She wanted you to attack her so that you d show your jealousy or that she won t be the only bad person here by her standards   You should reiterate that she can feel bad about it because she broke her own hard boundary and you re slightly disappointed not by the sex but by her behaviour afterwards  because you were concerned that she might have been a victim or witnessed something disturbing as you wrote So    you agreed to a rule for your relationship  monogamy   not because it was important to you but because it was important to her  She then broke her own rule and you didn t particularly care because honestly you never cared about it in the first place  And somehow she s claiming you re the asshole here      This conflict is purely internal to her  On the one hand  she thinks she wants monogamy  but on the other hand  apparently she actually doesn t  You re basically an innocent bystander  Her anger at you is misplaced Did he creampie her     Aren t you worried about STIs now You are not the asshole but you are missing the important point here  Why did she cheat  Since she believes in monogamy  there should be an explanation  She is mad because you are not trying to find the reason behind this act  Do you have any problems at your relationship  Does she feel neglected  Not sexually pleased  Is she bored  I am sensing there are issues she cant admit to her self and believes you should care more to dig them up  I know we are weird creatures   NTA    you re fine     To make a long story short  the harmful betrayal of infidelity is not the physical actions  but the deception   She worked through it and as long as she wasn t trying to hide it from you or find a way to keep her cake and have it eat her out too     I think you guys have a good relationship foundation   She sounds like a good person who made a bad decision  not a bad person making bad decisions all the time Nta  You have an incredibly healthy attitude  and the world would be a better place with more people like you in it  The fact that everybody isn t just poly is the source of Ludicrous amounts of drama I think she wants out op and expected you to start it offI think her reaction is understandable IF you never told her about your polyamorous past   If that is the case  then she doesn’t know you’d be pretty much ok with it  and that is a shock to most people   If you have told her about your polyamorous past  then that gives her a bit of advanced warning that it might not be a terrible thing for her to do   If she did it anyway and is now mad that you’re not mad  it’s almost like she did it because she wants out of the relationship but doesn’t want to do it herself   In her mind 1   you’re mad and want a divorce   2   you’re not mad and don’t care about her and she wants a divorce   It’s kind of brilliant in her part   Going forward  she broke trust in a big way   Given the way she reacted herself  I doubt being polyamorous is in her wheelhouse  and if she’s going to cheat  she’ll probably do it again  especially if you don’t care   So you’re left with being a poly guy in a monogamous relationship with a cheater  who is probably not going to allow you to be poly with her   I think it’s the beginning of the end of your marriage  unfortunately Sounds like she may have been hoping to hurt you  That’s not good  but if you stay  chances are she will stoop even lower looking for where you draw the line NTA but she s probably looking for a way out of the relationship where she is the victim to everyone else which is why she shifted to this stance She cheated to get you to react  She’s more upset you’re not crushed or angry than she is about any supposed betrayal   Put another way  she betrayed you and is upset you don’t feel it enough Problem isn t that she slept with someone else  Problem is that SHE thought that was hard boundary and violated it anyway  She sucks  NTA just cos she s an asshole for wilfully betraying you  or at elast thinking she was and doing it anyway  NTA Your wife cheated  and she is angry because you are not upset   That is the most ridiculous thing I ve ever heard   Did she cheat just to make you upset to prove you care for her   It certainly sounds like it   Pretzel logic   Lie and tell her you are extremely upset  Then kick her out of the house forever   That should prove you really care  and she will be happy NTA your wife s on some BS  She betrayed you  you are entitled to react how you see fit she doesn t get to play victim and make out you did something because you aren t reacting how she expects you to Lol reverse psychology  not giving the cheater the gratification of the cheat  what a revelation  your breaking new ground here OP  The issue tho is you were betrayed  she thought it would hurt you and still did itNTA  Don t listen to all the bullshit about cheating and respect  You love her  for once  on Reddit  in a healthy way  She must forgive herself and can t blame you for being a mature human being  Talk a lot to her  whenever she will be ready  She has to understand that comprehension is not disinterest and that you really love her as she is  with all the load of errors and contradictions a human being carries with him her NTA  Buddy  she s trying to project her guilt on to you to releive the guilt she s feeling  and she doesn t even realize that she s doing it  Don t fall for that bullshit  It s her guilt to feel and she needs to own it NTA  obviously Reminds me of another post i read a while ago where the woman  unintentionally  cheated with her husband by having sex with the man she met at the club  The woman was remorseful of what happened and tried to win back the husband but to no avail  I am glad that yours didn t end up bad and you were so forgiving of your wife  she s fortunate to have you  NTA for me NTA but damn   you re built different   no punNTA  You don’t have to have the “norm” reaction  I think it’s beautiful you have a free love perspective   I wonder what’s behind her feeling like you should be mad  Like was she hoping you would be and want out  not assuming anything but it’s odd she’s pressed NTA but your wife is a piece of work  She violated an important value of her own  and then has the audacity to be mad at you for giving her grace 🥴NTA  Some women have a compelling need for their partner to be jealous and possessive or they think they don’t care about them  It’s usually a reflection of how they feel about you  THEY would be furious so you should be too  I’ve ended a few relationships when they exhibited those traits You are not  she is  After all  she was “very monogamous”… veryNTA she cheats on you and you re the asshole for not being upset  Of course  she d tell you you re an asshole if you were upset too  This is about her being a trashbag of a human beingYour perspective is fascinating and don t let anyone talk you out of your own ways  they are far more evolved than most of us  You re NTA  communicate with her openly and clearly  put all the cards on the table  your wife knew who she was marrying and you ve done nothing wrong  she clearly has some insecurity issues that will be a major issue if you don t work on them  Just so it s clear  what she did is a major betrayal in her view Nta as you have always been upfront about your point of view NTA and I’d add that she doesn’t deserve you  at all NTA you do care you just care about her more than her infidelity  You saying you were raised by hippie parents makes even more sense to your reaction  For you cheating isn’t the end of the world but for her it is  I think this is more of a sit down and talk about her feelings and yours because what she wants is you to react how she would  Angry and crying but you can just explain that’s not who you are  that you care about her overall  Also she’s the one who cheated she doesn’t get to be pissy with youFuck that  NTA  Your wife is fucking horrible NTA  She s upset that SHE broke her vow but was hoping YOU would  punish  her rather than her owning up to her wrongdoing  Plus she s probably confused because now she s got a glimpse as to your view of  free love So I don’t like getting into debates like this anymore as crazy tends to follow  As their is some crazy comments already making you the bad guy or her not the bad girl  I want to give you three theories as to why she is angry and is acting like this   Theory 1  like the crazy comments suggest she was testing you to see if you cared enough about the relationship by cheating  She most likely knew your past so she cheated to see if you would react and prove you care about her and the relationship  Completely crazy as I said due to if you had “her values” for monogamy then the relationship would have ended  The reason she would be upset is due to you not reacting the way she wanted   Theory 2  she wanted a divorce and didn’t want to talk about it like adults should  This theory is the most likely  The reason she would be upset is due to you not divorcing her   Theory 3  she wanted to cheat and make you the villain  The way she would accomplish this is by you getting angry at her cheating and probably throw her out of the house  After she is thrown out she runs to friends and family and tells them your an abuser  They immediately sympathize with her and say what she did wasn’t her fault and blame you instead  This then could lead to cops being called and you falsely arrested  Not super likely this is correct  but it has happened before   Thought I’m sure she wouldn’t tell you the real reason as she has lied already  All in all your NTA  The weirdo’s who are trying to justify her actions in the comments are not helpful NTA  You have a healthier perspective on it all than most and you sound very loving with her   She’s going through a major growth and maturing in her understanding right now and it doesn’t come without a lot of big mess emotion as we let go of who we thought we were  Remember her identity was largely built around monogamy  But she doesn’t understand yet that meaning is constructed   She’s constructed her identity around monogamy  and so when she transgresses that there is also “real” meaning to it    There’s an also an ego trip going on within lower self functioning where you want your partner to be jealous of you as if that signifies and conveys meaning    Alternatively  she could use this to destruct your whole relationship  People who think this way use cheating as a way to end things when they don’t have the courage to do so otherwise  Because it transgresses a widely accepted convention it forces the other person to break up with them when they don’t want to do that dirty work themselves in the traditional approach to cheating    If it is really about her looking for signifiers of how you feel toward her  you can reframe this for her  There’s so much love in how you treat her just by what I read  Making her a cup of tea  really caring enough to know why she’s distant to the point that you push for the uncomfortable conversation  accepting whatever her answer is with love and teaching her to laugh off something so overly heavily serious brooding over her by showing her a different perspective on it…you’ve been extremely loving to her over this and the signifiers of that are right there for the seeing  or in her case the pointing out   If you can help her see that you will help her grow    If on the other hand she’s using it to emotionally shut things down between you  even if her story becomes “it was too good so I had to ruin it in self sabotage” as an excuse to change your relationship terms  i e  the beginning of her path out  I would confront her head on on with that   do you want this to change this  Do you want out   If no great  if yes let’s get a really good therapist where the best we can do is work through it clearly and cleanly if you really don’t want to be in this relationship  Hopefully that’s not the case and she’s just confused and coming face to face with her deep seated beliefs about what really is “moral ” And what love really is    It’s important for you to realize that even though you don’t see it as a transgression she sees it as a transgression so it’s important that you acknowledge and address that  She feels like she had a choice and she betrayed you  You can turn it around by helping her see that the choice was that she let her self get  drunk enough and put herself in a position where she made these decisions  and if she wants to avoid that in the future  she prevents it earlier down the chain    This is part of growing up   we think we have this highly idealistic value  and then life happens and then we have to figure out how to process that  Hopefully this helps seasons her and makes her ultimately a less judgmental and more compassionate being towards others  especially around this whole topic  It should be quite eye opening for her  And your love should be quite healing   and who knows maybe you’ll both end up realizing polygamy or moral nonmonogomy is both a fun and meaningful path for you both together    But in order to get there  she’s going to have to let go of some really deep beliefs and all of the trappings around that holding them up and that’s some deep work for her to do  This could be a very good thing on the path towards that  And in a way  this was bound to happen because whenever someone puts so much importance and emphasis on something like that we can almost predict that it is going to become challenged and fail as a loudly  asked for and much needed life lesson  The best thing you can do is hold the space for her and be non reactive while helping her to process and reframe things in a new healthier way Lol how did she find a way to be the victim in all this NTA  My man is the same way and even encourages me to be sexual with other men because he works a lot and can’t always be there with me  It took a minute for me to understand that he does that because he loves me not because he doesn’t care about me I find it infinitely funny that the fucking cheater is claiming that the person they cheated on never cared about the relationship and is worried the person they cheated on has cheated  The absolute audacity   NTA  But seriously  unhitch your wagon from this one Wow you married a pos not only cheating on you but calling you the asshole  Tell your wife she s a cunt pleaseNTA  Imagine OP is an atheist and the wife is Muslim  The wife is quite religious and wants to follow the teachings  She goes and eats some bacon  She feels super guilty about it and tells OP  OP doesn’t care about it because his beliefs allow the eating of pork  The wife is upset that OP is not upset about her breaking religious rules that he doesn’t follow   Sounds like it is her problem  OP can try to help her through it but she needs to work through her issues or change her beliefs to something that is realistic  Many people pride themselves on how “strong” they are at something  She can either make progress on self improvement or accept a more open lifestyle The OP entered a monogamous marriage with his wife  He s not fucking anyone else   It s the wife who cheated  granted that OP has a differing view on sex  but that would matter if it was a polyamorous marriage  The wife  cheated in a monogamous relationship  and is now displacing guilt and anger ontop OP  because she betrayed her own belief in what marriage should be  Its disingenuous to take OPs view on sex as a by because he personally doesn t place that big a deal on sex as a by foe letting her break marriage vows they both made where they vowed to be monogamous  Can t believe people aren t just calling out the act of cheating just because OP has differing views on sex  He changed his behaviour to suit the woman he married  He s not doing anyone  else and was genuinely concerned for his wife until the truth came out You re NTA  but I d get therapy for your wife and see what it is she wants now  To stay married or call it a day  Maybe she can recover from this and your marriage will be stronger  but without communication between the two of you it could be the end NTA but I ve been there  so I asked for some  time to think things through  one week no contact to let him stew in his own juices and then come back with  I want to fight for this relationship  I forgive you  and that s itNTA  But you need to have a real discussion with her about all this and establish your boundaries   A few things to think about     She feels terrible and thought she was betraying you  Yet she still did it   What does that say about her feelings towards you and your relationship    You are basically telling her it is fine for her to do it again   And she almost certainly will   Be careful about her forming an emotional bond and relationship with one of her future partners    When it happens again are there any sort of boundaries for both you and her  For example  how many dates with one person is too many  what happens if she gets pregnant  etc    Be careful if you have kids   If you play with fire just make sure they don t get burned She wants you to be mad and sad and fight for her NTA but I am concerned for you  The issue here isn’t sex it’s breaking a promise  She’s thinking two things  which don’t matter since she’s the one who cheated  but they are if he doesn’t care is he cheating  And if he doesn’t care about me breaking a promise does he even care about the relationship  Again those aren’t on you to make her feel better about  she is the one who cheated  However that is why she is acting the way she is and I’m sure part of it is that she knows she fucked up so she’s deflectingYour wife is an asshole  You sound derpy as shit  She almost sounds like she’s not getting something out of this relationship she needs and wants to strike back at you with this  Mean while… your just like free love baby… lmao  Get your shit together  Can’t imagine this relationship is solid NTA  you don t have to feel bad if you don t want to  I think the issue you re really running into here is that she see s this act as some huge betrayal  but if you don t then she is just going to be paranoid that you are going to cheat on her in the future because you don t think anything of it and she won t have any moral high ground So she values monogamy and still cheated  That’s the real problemAt least you could discuss the monogamy thing if she cant even stick to her own values allegedly  this doesnt seem healthy for youIt’s a bit weird that she’s married to you but doesn’t actually seem to know you honestly  came to this thread thinking you were a cuck from the title     now just gonna call you baller    However  unfortunately once she gets over this  if she does    this isn t going to be the last time this happens as she is just gonna view this as a free pass whenever she see a young hot guy cause fuck it  you don t give a shit NTA  You wife is TA though  She cheated  even though she holds monogamy on a pedestal for her own reasons  She feels as though she did something terrible  but she did it anyway  It s kind of beside the point that you aren t bothered by it You re NTA but find a better wife maybe  You are a non monogamous and still upheld your end of the bargain  Your wife on the other hand showed a complete desecration of her own values and morals   Not to mention  I can understand a drunken kiss in the moment  But when you re literally leaving the club to go have sex at someone s place  That s a lot of time to think  And she can t even say  I didn t think you would care because of your upbringing and views   She ASSUMED you would care  She s mad at you re NOT mad  She disrespected you whether you care about the event happening or not The twist of logic your wife needs to turn this back on you makes me think there is more to this  Like she needs someone to be the bad guy  Staying with incompatibility leads to resentment  I never cared about cheating either  but this is not about that  There are deep seated beliefs that you will keep bumping up against with her  Please seriously re evaluate this relationship Definitely not the asshole  You guys just have different views on sex and casual sex  But sounds like you guys could use more talking about the way you perceive sex vs her and try to reach some common ground So you re poly   But your wife feels monogamous    YOU commit to the relationship and keep it between you two   SHE cheats   YOU haven t done anything wrong yet   And now she wants to pin the blame on HER cheating     For HER monogamy     and you re like okay sort you feel bad it s okay   And now SHE S upset because you don t feel bad about HER actions    M guy you re not the asshole    Neither is your wife I think  oddly enough  but she needs to screw her head properly onto her shouldersEveryone s comments are accurate  But the other man  could be a person  in this situation  don t they care that they ve potential enabled considerable drama in someone else s life  I guess it goes out the window when drinking  but some folks seem to casually fuck around with other people s lives It may be a handshake to you  but to her it s a 400 ton oil spill  Then factor in she is the one who did it  she is making you out to be the bad guy so she doesn t have to face the consequences of her actions    You should  talk again and get to the root of how its a betrayal and when those crocodile tears peak and she s got a snot bubble take a picture  then frame that picture and tell her you still love her every day Why would you be the asshole for not being angry at an asshole  She didn t respect you and she wants you to be sad  The fuck INFO  Why did you bother getting married and signing up for monogamy  When she got married  she knew what she was signing up for but she went back on  her  marriage vows  She destroyed the marriage by social standards  If this doesn t hurt you then it doesn t hurt us   You both need to communicate what you want out of this  What does she want  What do you want  Should you bother being married to each other  Why did it hurt her so much to sleep with someone else  since she knew it was bad  You told her your upbringing was poly  so she can t be surprised by how you re handling things  If anyone is wrong it s her actions and her actions on how she thinks you should feel    But playing into her mindset  does she want you to lash out  get a divorce  or open up the relationship  I think this is where conversation should start and end  Every marriage is unique  But if both people aren t happy or on the same page then what s the point  Good luck to you both Not being upset is generally not asshole behavior  but this speaks to a major miscommunication in your marriage  She s upset because she knows what a commitment marriage is  and she betrayed your loyalty  The fact that she feels this way is a pretty good sign  It means she s probably not looking for a way out of the marriage  She wants you to be angry at her   to show you care about it as much as she does  If you think this is nothing  then you might see other infidelity as nothing  in which case you might as well not be monogamous  and might as well not be married  She needs to know you share this value  In fact   with her infidelity   she likely wants to be comforted with the knowledge that you re stronger than her in this regard  She doesn t want this used as an excuse for you to go out and have sex with other people  Like   she did it  and you were totally fine with it  Then  if you do it  she should have no right to be mad about it    but she will be mad about it  And she will be jealous of whomever that affair is with  As if she wasn t good enough to satisfy you and you had to go elsewhere to have your needs met  If you re so casual about it  that makes this hypothetical situation in her head possible  And if it s possible   it may even be likely    Marital counseling is likely needed  It s going to be really difficult if you re in completely different places on this  What if she finds out she s pregnant soon   and you have no idea if it s your kid  or some other dudes kid  Even if nothing comes of this   this will always sit in her mind  She s never going to feel like you re equal because she s constantly going to be trying to make up for this  Even with dumb things     Oh  I can t be too forceful with my opinion on which house we buy  I did a bad thing  so my judgment can t be trusted     Or it might come up in arguments later  if either of you loses your temper    This has to be discussed thoroughly  and if I were you  I d be concerned about the infidelity   Studies have shown that GENERALLY men cheat because they re bored   and women cheat because they re unhappy  Men can still love their wife  have a happy life  and just want to get their rocks off with someone different  Male brain chemistry tends to urge them to propagate as much as possible to further the human race  Women tend to form tighter emotional bonds to people they have sex with  It s in their brain chemistry  Women are wired to connect themselves to the male that might father their child  because they re generally helpless for at least a few weeks while recovering from childbirth  and traditionally are the ones raising children  while the male finds the food and supports them  If they re forming those bonds with someone else  it s because they re not feeling those bonds with their husband    If you want your marriage to last   yall need to get on the same page NTA  It sounds like she can t comprehend that a man can love her without feeling possessive in regard to her  Your lack of jealousy translates to apathy in her mind  It s actually very understandable given the way you describe her attitude towards relationships in general  I would even assume that she cheated on you just to provoke a jealous reaction out of you  I think it s difficult for 2 people to be in a relationship when they have such strongly opposing views on what constitutes love and commitment but I guess with enough open conversation and empathy you can resolve the issue She’s projecting her feelings about herself on to you  NTA  but she needs to do some introspection work to figure out why she was okay doing something to you SHE sees as such a disgusting and huge betrayal  and she needs to work through her anger at herself instead of placing that anger on you for not being angry at her I you two need a long conversation about this because she’s probably regretting the decision she made and is hurting because of it because she views sex differently then you and saw this as a act of betrayal and thought it would hurt you  This is a Situation that should help you set new boundaries if you wish to keep your relationship monogamous  Always keep in mind that not everyone views sex and relationships like you do You re NTA  She s projecting onto you   no one here can speak for her but I think she s likely betrayed her own sense of self by doing this  There s an incongruence with your reaction and how she s feeling  She thinks she violated your agreement   which to an extent she did   but it seems like for you the betrayal is like her eating your takeout leftovers without asking   that is to say  not a big deal    I d be sensitive though   she feels like this a big deal even if you don t  She needs to unpack this which goes well beyond your reaction  Best of luck I m with you but we are a very non vocal minority on reddit holy crap imagine betraying someone and getting mad that the person I betrayed isn t mad at me for betraying them  that s the craziest scenario ever  NTA  and also  FWIW my take on what actually happened  she thinks you’ve cheated   because she has low self esteem  and can’t believe you wouldn’t   so she retaliated   Now that you’re not upset  She’s inclined to take that as more evidence   NTA  but FWIW  she doesn’t sound like a stable partner  Sounds like she has been keeping too much to herself YNTAH   your wife needs to get some therapy She values monogamy  which means cheating is a deal breaker  You decided  quote     I figured if I could do monogomy with anyone  it would be her     Your wife married you under the premise of mutual monogamy  and unless you had previously come to a specific agreement otherwise    the implied consequence of either one of you cheating should be the same    cheating is a deal breaker   She had every right to expect you to view her cheating as a breach of trust  He actions leading up to her confession illustrate how important the topic of infidelity is to her  Since you clearly have the same opinion you had pre marriage  and reinforced that to her after confession  she now questions how you could marry her and if you were possibly deceitful of your opinion of monogamy  She s likely trying to figure out how you can place any value in marriage  She s likely also questioning whether she can trust you  period   This is now about more than her cheating    it s about you willingly  or unwillingly  deceiving her the meaning of marriage       to you    You definitely aren t the AH  She cheated    You also likely aren t meant to be with someone who covets monogamy Dude  she s gaslighting you Here is something you can possibly do to make her understand    Ask her if she loves the guy  When she says no  you explain to her that you dont see having sex with someone else as cheating  You dont do it because of your love and respect for her    If she doesn t love him  it doesn t bother you  She is already punishing herself because of how bad she feels  and it s easy to forgive her because she clearly loves you more  If she didn t  she would not have felt bad You re glomming onto the sex and missing the bigger picture  She doesn t respect boundaries and doesn t respect your emotional autonomy  i e  the betrayer gets ZERO input on how the betrayed chooses to react    You don t care if she fucks other people  she needs jealousy to feel loved  This a mismatch on a core tenet of your relationship  and this doesn t end here  She ll find other ways to cross your boundaries and get the reaction that she NEEDS to feel loved She cheated and YOU RE the asshole I mean now is the opportunity to be like  “well my turn” If you re fine with it  you re fine with it  you shouldn t have to fake outrage NTA Also not to be a armchair therapist but is it possible she  subconsciously   wanted the affair to end the marriage and is mad that you didn’t care for that reason Dude she looked at it like it was cheating  She knew it was wrong  She did it anyway  I am wondering if she had the intention of cheating before going out  Like she brought up to her friends how your husband doesn’t care about sexual monogamy and her friends probably told her that he would actually care if she got with someone else and it probably ate at her  Would he even care about relationship enough that he would be upset I was sexually intimate with another man  Then low and behold they probably bugged her about it while they were out and when she was drunk she probably thought “I’ll show them and him  he WILL care if I cheat” and then you literally proved her friends right  You’re not an asshole but it’s not normal to be that open sexually  Like where does the intimacy happen if not then  She probably really regretted it when she sobered up and thought “he WILL care and it will break up our relationship” and then you literally told her you didn’t care she slept with someone else  I could never be with someone like you though fr NTA   You are ok with an open relationship  but she seems to have cheated and is blaming you for not passing her test to prove that you ll be wildly jealous    That s really outrageous of her   Remind her that if cheating is wrong  she s the one to blame  not you   She s being totally ridiculous She also blatantly lied to you about where she was going and why  for the record NTA  She knew who you were when you married her  You’ve been devoted and monogamous because that’s her requirement  You don’t have to be the jealous type  HOWEVER  if a few months or years go by and this happens a few more times you may need to have a talk  If this was a one time thing for her fine  you can live with it  But if she’s expecting you to play by rules she doesn’t want to follow that’s another story NTA  She s being kind of a freak imo  but I know the type  Since you re not insanely jealous they assume that you don t really care  because in their mind men are supposed to be possessive  Or  maybe she s upset about something else and just sucks at communicating revisit this thread in two months when you find out she s pregnant  attitudes will be different Not an asshole  Maybe your parents conceived while tripping   NTA but just because you are chill about sex and monogamy  your partner isn t and was still fully willing to betray you  I d reexamine any faith I had in her despite having a similar view on polyamory as you do  Trust and willingness to step over such lines are not simply related to sex  For her part  she is lashing out at you because she rightfully feels bad and wants to project the fault onto you  It s well within your right to forgive her but I can t help but feel you are oversimplifying the issue  Do you have conflict avoidance issues from childhood trauma because that can be confused for a laid back attitude about how people treat you my comment will probably get drowned  but op i have similar  not exact same  views that you do  you’re obviously NTA for not having a big reaction  but i implore you to look at this situation from a different light    you   your partner agreed to a set of boundaries when you agreed to be monogamous and you agreed to do it specifically for her  she broke the boundaries of that relationship structure and for that you should be mad at her  it was completely disrespectful on her part and frankly it’s disgusting that she’s trying to paint you as the villain    she knew your views when getting into the relationship  she’s the one who cheated  not in air quotes because she broke the boundaries of a monogamous relationship  and now you’re the one asking if you’re the bad guy    please reevaluate this person   the relationship She s being very manipulative  She was the person who did something wrong  and when you didn t react in the way she wanted you to react  she called you an asshole even though she cheated  NTA NTA  However  there s some underlying issue here that needs to be addressed This is a rough thread  I want a woman loyal as my dearly departed golden retriever Creative writing   This isn’t about sex  it’s about trust and commitment  I get OP not caring about casual sex  but the following should bother him    A  they agreed to be monogamous  and she betrayed that agreement  no discussion of opening the relationship   B  She thought it was a an awful awful thing to do and decided to do it anyways  C  OP has  willingly  sacrificed his open relationship ideals to be with her  The monogamy was her need  So he’s had to make compromises to meet her need  and she turned around and did the very thing she required him not to do Definitely NTA  My experience in poly and mono relationships is that people can have VERY different beliefs surrounding sex     Unless OP went totally berserk  I don t think there are many situations where the reaction to the wife cheating makes the OP the AH I think she did it and wanted it to upset you  because she needs to feel like being in a monogamous relationship has changed you from the way you were    She can t feel secure with you with this difference of outlook because maybe it makes her not trust you  or not feel the love which monogamous people derive from jealousy   You re NTA  but this relationship might not be sustainable Even if you don’t care for monogamy  you have to recognize that she does and still made a decision to lie to you and go sleep with someone knowing she was betraying you Funny situation  Really  unexpected    NTA  You have a very open view on sex and intimacy that many do not have  in fact I would say you are a small percent that thinks like this   I would be concerned that your wife drank so much that her inhibitions were not only lost but that she ignored her moral compass so to speak and chose to have sex with someone younger than herself    She was purely monogamous and felt that sex was very personal and intimate   OP consider having a good sit down conversation and state that communication is open for you both to be honest and straight forward   Let her talk about what and why this happened and her reasons for being so upset and freaked out after  she did break her marriage vows but  I feel there is something more here      Listen and hear what she says      Speak your part and hope that she listens and hears what you say   Know that generally speaking many relationships break apart after cheating and she might have expected you to rage and freak out  your calm demeanor might have shocked her more   Hoping for an update  Wishing you the best OP I think OP might be in denialAsk her to get testedESH   She sucks for cheating  you suck for essentially to reverting to  polyamory is fine   despite being in a monogamous relationship for years  as son as the relationship hits a speed bump   I get why she is upset with you  but she is also a massive AH I know I am probably going to get down voted her but hopefully people will read my words first   YTA  Not because you didn’t get upset about the sex  if you had that would make you a hypocrite    But  what about the lying   She told you she was going to “crash at a friends house” LIE   Did she call you and tell you “honey I’ve met this young hot guy and I want to bone him ”  If she had  I would agree that was within your boundaries  but she didn’t do that   She HID that information   Then she LIED by omission EVERY time you asked her about it until several days later    You stayed true to your beliefs but she VIOLATED hers and then lied about it afterward   Being a hippy and free love was about openness and honesty   Your wife showed the opposite of that   She is an AH   But for you to ignore the lies  you are too Polyamory is not cheating  Rules  boundaries  etc are absolutely necessary  You can cheat in a poly relationship just like a monogamous one  I would be concerned that she was so out of control that something this big occurred  You don t have to care about the sex  but you should care that she lied to you and violated trust ESH     You shouldnt be upset about the cheating  Or rather  it is absolutely fine not to be  if that is how your mind works     But about the lying  the huge breach of trust  the secretiveness       You let her walk all over you by just ignoring those aspects of the cheating        And honestly  I myself am somewhat promiscuous  but I still hate cheating  Not because my partner touched someone else  but because if he did it without my consent  it means he broke my trust Our wifeI d question that timeline   If she lucid enough to send you a text about staying at a friends house and then slept with this guy  that was more premeditated than she is letting on Wait  she fucked a guy  but you are the one that does not care  HahahahabahaI’m poly as well so I get it 🤷🏻‍♀️ monogamy is construct based on ownership  originally and hasn’t changed much  society has been conditioned     Poly has always seemed and felt more natural to me  I guess it’s just like did she use protection and maybe get a test just in case once every three months for the next 6 to 9 months just in case cos oral and kissing can spread STDs too 🤷🏻‍♀️NTAH  she has no idea how lucky she is wrt to your open minded approach   Yeap  she is unhappy that you aren t possessive enough about her  Most guys would have divorced her You are a keeper  I m well adjusted socially and I have a high degree of empathy  People who are well adjusted and with a high degree of empathy know that it is not something you announceIf only there was a word for guys who where ok with the wife cheating 🤔Jesus Christ  I don’t want to sound sexist  but sometimes women don’t use common sense  She admitted to cheating  you took it better than 99 99% of other men  then she’s mad at you  Bro  you know you’re NTA  I’m sorry this happened to youNTA wtf  She literally cheated on you and now she’s trying to guilt trip and manipulate you  Why on earth are you still with her  She did not care about you when she had some other person inside of her   You deserve so much better and it is so sad that you do not see that  I get that you were raised differently  but she was raised to know that you do not cheat on someone you say that you love NTA BUT  People who are monogamous tend to expect anger   upset at this situation    when you don’t express that  she is feeling like you don’t care about the monogamy  which means you won’t care about respecting it  In her mind  that puts you in a position to freely cheat   not even consider it cheating  or a big deal worth mentioning    I think you should gently talk to her about it again but try not to downplay the cheating  You don’t have to lie or pretend you’re upset  but just reassure her that you DO respect the monogamy of your relationship   you aren’t going to use this as an excuse to cheat later YTA  A cuckold can never be NTA NTA  Maybe she was acting out… sex is an important intimate act to her  so if she believes you don’t really care about her  maybe she cheated at least subconsciously as a way to get back at you and to test your love  And you not caring is perhaps the worst response in her mind   I’m not sure what you can do to convince her  but good luckNTA  she is purely mono but cheated  odd almost as if i can sense some kind of pattern over these reddit posts🤔Is this a movie plot  Fake as fuck YTA  What she did was a big deal and a betrayal of your marriage and commitment to each other  Pretending it’s not does nothing for her  If you want to help her  get appropriately angry and let her make amends You are both emotional cripples Sometimes  women act out because they want a man to reinforce some kind of structure they feel is lacking  It can look like this  Your style is lackadaisical  from this post  and it may not be a good fit for the type of discipline the wayward inner child is seeking   That s just my intuition  Especially as I suspect she had an authoritarian kind of parenting NTA  She s definitely more mad at herself than at you  and she s projecting that  But rather than the cheating  since  to you  it s just sex and not related to love or romantic intimacy  I d be more upset about the fact that you gave up that sort of lifestyle because SHE values monogamy and then she pretty much threw it away for no reason  I m of the mind that cheating while drunk is of no excuse  it s a lot harder to have sex with someone at a club than to literally just not As an answer to your specific question  I would have to say NAH   She is an AH for cheating in a monogamous relationship  but that s not really your question   You both just view sex differently   You are not an asshole for not being upset   But at the same time  she is not an asshole for expecting you to be upset   To her  sex is an intensely personal act to be shared with someone she loves   Right now  she feels like absolute shit for cheating on you  honestly  as she should    She confessed what happened and was expecting to get an angry reaction  which is how most people would react   She spent all this time agonizing over it and when she did tell you  you just swept it under the rug like it wasn t a big deal   It is a big deal to her   The fact that it is not a big deal to you shows her that how you view your relationship is different from how she views it NAH  It s a tough pill to swallow when you don t uphold your own standards  and have to face the fact that you are actually capable of doing certain things  She accidentally pulled the rug from under her own feet and discovered the ground beneath wasn t what she thought it was  It s not about you  but her own confusion and anger  And maybe she d always thought of herself as morally superior somehow  like if someone in this relationship were to cheat  it d be you  with your sexually liberal past and mindset   not her  who places great importance on monogamy and intimacy    Just because we re adults  it doesn t mean we stop learning about life and about ourselves  She just hadn t come across this particular lesson until now  and to be honest  she s getting it for cheap  She s learned that alcohol greatly impairs her judgement  She s learned that impaired judgement can lead her to do things she considers morally wrong  She s learned how it feels to betray the person she thought she was  and to have her world turn upside down  And she s learning all of this without paying the price of her whole relationship like many others do   I think she s lashing out and doesn t mean her accusations  but I think you might want to approach the conversation in a different way to make her more receptive to your forgiveness  This is something you can work past if she can see it as a learning opportunity to avoid pitfalls next time   ETA  It s not great that it took a few days to get the truth from her  but I can still chalk it up to her being unable to come to terms with what she d done  I don t know whether she would ve kept it secret if left to her own devices  but at least she did come clean pretty easily She is feeling very badly of herself because she did a forbidden thing  Maybe try to explain to her your hippie thing as you wrote here  maybe ask her if she did it because there is an issue in your couple life  not accusating  and if maybe it is the right moment to consider swinging a little  No enforcement obviously   But  I was drunk  is NEVER a valid excuse It’s because she wanted to try and hurt him  She has something mentally wrong with her and doesn’t have self control  She sounds crazy and as soon as identified that  I would cut her off There s more going on here than you realize I m afraid  If I had to guess  she did it because she already thought you wouldn t care based on your own admission   Which is a childish and AH thing to do  obviously  but your the AH for not getting upset at the fact that it was an obvious sign of disrespect  even with your open stance  Once you lose a woman s respect  it s over for you  dude ESHYou got married last year and you’ve known each other for 8 years  Zero chance your wife didn’t understand your thoughts on sex  She believes marriage vows are sacred  but knows you don’t    Alcohol doesn’t change a person  it lowers inhibitions  She went out that night with the intent to cheat to see your reaction   test whether your views matched your words  They apparently did  so she’s pissed  your vows don’t mean as much to you as her did to her  It’s a twisted way to look at it  but that’s how she was thinking    I don’t really want to say YTA  but I will say that the two of you created this situation by not having a mutual understanding about what marriage vows mean  Until your wife believes you’re on the same page as her  she’s never going to be content in your marriage because she’s not going to believe you’re committed to it  She also needs some therapy to be able to learn how to talk through issues rather than take actions to confront issues that might lead to irreversible damage in the relationship Let’s cut the BS and get to the meat  basics  You’re not upset because deep down you really don’t love her or care about your relationship  Blame your parents all ya want to but you’re the type that really will never truly be in a relationship  Own it my guyYTA  You entered into a contract with specific parameters  To be clear  marriage the most legally and emotionally significant thing that you can do  You entered into a monogamous relationship with a person who clearly stated that monogamy was important to her  Her views on the matter are probably more common than your views   Theennnnnnnn……  basically told her that the rules of the relationship are not important to you   Probably in the most insensitive way you possibly could  Reading this bummed me out man  I can’t imagine if my wife did that to me  Just a diff mindset  I hope you can work it out Get a grip man  Your wife lied to you and broke her vow  Your personal opinion on the matter isn’t the point  find some self respect You’re a cuckYTA She was sober enough to text you and lie   She’s still lying   It’s not transactional and OK for HER  She did something INTENSELY against her moral compass  Lazily shrugging it off is not helpful for this relationship  If you had one ounce of self awareness  you’d want to sit down and ask her how she got to that place   Her perception that you don’t care is not far off You’re NTA but I can see from her side that it could seem like you’re not fighting for the relationship  Not saying you are but if you look at sex differently it could seem like that  Maybe having an open relationship isn’t a bad thing for either of you but if you put some ground rules down it would at least look like you do so care enough to keep your relationship together more special The biggest reason people cheat comes from insecurity and low self esteem  It s completely possible that she cheated  because  she wanted you to react with jealousy  proving that you care about your relationship and that you want her and nobody else  NTA  I think you two need to talk about what s really bothering herThis world is fucked  your wife is an asshole and you are dementedyoure good man  your wife seems incredibly toxic tho 😬YTAH  You chose monogamy for her instead of your polyamorous roots and you’re not even the slightest bit upset  You sacrificed your sexuality and intimacy to comply with your wife and she betrayed you by doing something she claimed was against her morales  At the very least be mad at that  not so much the act you re just a spineless jellyfish but as long you re ok with this  its ok   definitely NTA You may not be an asshole but you are a cuckA group of friends recently had a conversation about swinging  purely as a hypothetical conversation and not as an invitation to swing in any way   I saw two key trends in  the conversation   Most of the guys could not get over the fact that another guy was having sex with their wife  especially while they watched   They came from a place of jealousy and “ownership”  i e  “my woman”   All of the women were more angry at men who swing  not so much that they were having sex with another woman  but rather  from the perspective that “you don’t love me enough because you would permit another man to have sex with me”   Take that anecdote as you will   ETA  I’m not sure why I got downvoted   I’m not advocating any position about swinging   Rather  I’m just posting an anecdotal observation of my experience discussing swinging with a group of men and women  and how their views differed between genders  which I found interesting NTA  I m the same way  I don t value fidelity  If my spouse cheated on me  I likely wouldn t care You re NTA and I had to burst out loud laughing at your response  She s gonna be fine  it was just sex  not loveObviously NTA   It s kind of funny that you have to help her in this situation but oh well     It s probably a very hard thing for her to digest and accept  Be patient  talk to her  try your best to explain to her how you see things and If it doesn t get better look for help if she is ok with it  I hope she can forgive herself and everything goes well You’re just the best  Love thisI don’t believe alcohol makes people cheat and I’ll say there is some underlying issue that isn’t being addressed  I think the I got drunk and slept with a hot guy is a cover story for what’s really wrong  I’m not saying it’s acceptable but it does  should   be addressed  Or I think you’ll see yourselves parting ways I am someone who views sex and relationships the same way and you are NTA from my perspective  However  she went through with it with the feeling that it is very much a betrayal towards her partner  While the action itself isn t an issue for you  her willingness to go against her own morals is concerning and something you might want to consider getting to the bottom of ESH  You for not setting boundaries and allowing her to go clubbing without you  Also for not seeing this as a big deal   Her for being unfaithful Tell us you re a cuck simp without telling us you re a cuck simp nothing about any of this is healthy or normal  If you can accept that she spent a night with someone else  you do not  truly love her   She isn t your world  you don t want to cherish that special bond that ONLY you too have   There is 0 point in this relationship Youre   A very confusing person but sometimes I wish I could see what you do   NTA you gave a fuck about the relationship  shes the one who didnt care  idk what to say about this   Like   Ofc I don t think you need lawyers    Maybe just talk to her about how she s the one seeking outside the relationship when she was monogamous You shouldn t be married   Neither should your wife   You give it no value   But yntahGo fuck someone  Hall pass CuckYTA  You’re a cuckNTA   Our perspective is uncommon but valid  I don’t think it’s a big deal either   She’s a hypocrite for pursuing physical gratification while pretending it means something other than that    I think that women in general view sex as a bartering tool to achieve their partnership goals  and men see it as a claim of “ownership” over a women    Perhaps the reason she’s devastated is that on some basic level she realizes she cannot use sex as a form of power or leverage over you   I’m not sure why so many people put emotional stock into sex  For me  it’s like eating chocolate  or getting a massage    Loving someone unconditionally has little to do with sex in my experience I grew up near a commune in the 70s  They were still abbhorent even then  I understand it though and you set the tone for your marriage  if you are ok with it  Why post  For me cheating is the deal breaker  It is a character flaw  I was convinced when I saw my generation X  running around no supervision becoming kids on a milk carton   If you are ok  then carry on  This is a sub for people who don t think it is ok  and want support   She will be a nightmare in todays internet  sex on an app culture  One year in  Ok buddy enjoy  She is a cheater  and they are liars too   So good luck with that Your wrong and she is right  but only you get to make a decision that’s right for you  Two things here   First  you said yourself it’s a committed  monogamous marriage   You and her both were operating under that premise   No conversations had happened around an open relationship and you don’t do that after   Second  the whole drunk thing is no excuse what so ever   She had enough of her faculties to give consent and even said so  She wasn’t assaulted or coerced  She left the club presumably in a car and went to his place and also had the awareness to text you and tell you she wasn’t coming home so she had already planned it by then  Both of those things means she purposely lied to you and also willingly broke her vow of monogamy to you   Now you can have whatever view you want about monogamy but when your SO makes a vow to you that is that important and willingly breaks it for someone she supposedly just met that’s terrible  Like I said you do you but the fact that she is now upset with you because you don’t care that she broke your marriage tells you that she knows what she did not only disrespected you but also your relationship  Now she is mad because your response tells her that the relationship has never been the same life long commitment to you she thought it was   She should be groveling at your feet snd instead she is the one that is mad Oh  I wish everyone were like you  You re great  don t change a bit If you want to be a cuckold more power to you I guess  But your wife is going to think much less of you and your relationship as you’ve already witnessed NAHNTANAH  I’d point out to her there’s also context  You thought she was assaulted or someone died   having sex with a rando kid is hardly freaking you out in comparison   But yea people find it weird  I let guys I date cheat so I know rather than be over protective and be let down  Just set the tone    I find the humiliation of being cheated on behind our back is worse than the sex itself  It’s good your wife told you right away  and you saw her remorse   I think context is everything  Maybe you’d have felt different if she covered it well and you found out in a year she’s been doing this all the time while you flipped to monogamy for her   Assure her you don’t want an open relationship or anything and will talk with her about what this means  At first I’d say you’re probably relieved she’s not traumatized  Yet you jumped to your worldview which is broader than this situation  Context  and limit the scope  NTA but you are kind of a fucking loser though NTA YTA  NTA for having feelings  No one is ever the asshole for having feelings and emotions  It does sound like you laughed at her when she was upset  and greatly minimized HER feelings and emotions because they don’t align with yours  YTA for that You’re weird  You’re not the asshole  but you’re weird  I’d still divorce because she’s already thinking about itESH  Your wife by being a literal piece of shit  w ho r e and cheating on you with some rando  while she values monogamy more than anything  and you by not realizing this is not about freedom of sex and that she betrayed your trust and her ideals just to get boned by some young guy  dump that bitch She is  painfully obviously  attempting to end your relationshipLeave her imo NTA  But If I were you  I would be pretty pissed that you changed a huge part of who you are for her and her standards and she cheated on you anyway  She is Very hypocrite   Women  She feels you don’t love her enough because her slip up  betrayal  didn’t make you sufficiently upset  NTA I guess you’re implying that she’s projecting her own guilt on you…  Too many psychological issues here to parse out lolhomie ik u don’t care  but if you have some self respect  you wouldn’t stay in a one sided monogamous relationship  burn the bridge  it’s over  maybe not for you  but for her it is“It strikes me as really possessive to be angry at her”  Yes monogamous relationships are extremely possessive  Trying not to be possessive is the basis of platonic love  Marrying someone is the opposite of that  Marrying someone is saying “I choose you  I claim you  you are mine and I am yours”She slept with a guy so you would break it off with her so she didn’t have to  Just end it like she wants You re NTA  but y all need to talk this out  probably with help  It d be one thing if you d done it  given your background  but  I suspect it s quite something else coming from her Ur NTA for being ok with poly   That isn’t the real issue here   It’s that she thought it wasn’t ok  But did it anyways   Meaning she didn’t really care if it was ok or not    That’s the real issue Well since you see it differently  just open it up  because she ll be doing it again  She s hardly punishing herself  she fucked another dude because she wanted to  not because she was drunk  and she lied to you and you  lacking some serious self respect aren t even bothered by that    You married a loser  who you shouldn t trust  but then again  you don t care who gets in her pants  so just open up your relationship  Which will be in your update post for us   The fact that she is also making this about you                says all you need to know about the type of person she is  Now you ve really seen her as her true self OP s got a hall pass then  maybe two  one to even up  and one as a penalty Nta she is putting her shame on youNTA but maybe need to turn your swag onWell she did  cheat   but you re a doormat so it s fine I guess Idk what kind of man could find out their wife betrayed them and say “I thought something horrible happened” like holy fuckShe cheated AND she’s gonna end up leaving you cause you don’t care    A man who doesn’t care if a woman sleeps with someone else is weak  Most women want to feel wanted and don’t like that kind of weakness  It’s over dudeI haven t seen anyone mention this yet  though maybe I just missed it   but is it possible that because she was incredibly drunk  the sex wasn t entirely consensual  and she s twisting up her feelings about that and turning it into anger aimed at you  I could see  you don t care  being a warped version of someone who feels that a non consensual encounter was their fault projecting that blame elsewhere because there s so much internalizing going on already   People have suggested she must have had the hots for this other guy previously  but you said she only met him at the club  You also didn t mention if  he  was drink   I m not saying I m for sure right  but there could be a lot more to this than just her feeling like your easygoing attitude with regard to sex means you don t care  She could potentially be lashing out because she doesn t know what else to do with what she s feeling  She may not even know for sure if it was totally consensual NTA but definable the CUCK  Your wife is not loyal to you  No purpose in being married anymore Now you’re officially a cuck  Maybe that will work for you twoif you like being a cuck you do you NTA  but also think OP needs to be more considerate of his spouse  He needs to think about how to punish this woman within the context of what she believes is acceptable  as proof of his anger and forgiveness   “Oh no  slaps walls  just so mad  falls down into a Walmart brat inspired manic limb flailing tantrum for a few minutes ”  Nailed it  believable NTA  Good luck with your gf OP lol This is funny    Get her tested and then have sex  Won t that assure her I guess    I wouldn t be able to forgive her  but you think different    nta but there is an argument that you should be more upset if you actually did care about monogamy like you promised when you got married  Which means YTA for lying that you wanted monogamy when you don t really care NTA but you don t value the bond between you as reverently as she does  She s blown away by the realization that you don t view sex as a significant exchange when to her it s one of the most important parts of your relationship  It s just so alien I can t relate  it s almost worse than cheating  You don t feel a special bond she takes for granted  Marriage just doesn t mean as much to you  I want to call you an asshole just because she s been fooling herself this entire time and I feel like  by the way the relationship is open  is something that should have come up at some point before the marriage  I think you re making me feel bad for a cheater YTA to yourself for having these insane ideas on what sex is and how that s gonna affect this marriage and your future ones  Basically the only thing keeping you from cheating is a mild interest in your wife and the fact you haven t had the opportunity to cheat with someone hotter                             Post Title  AITAH for breaking up with my boyfriend on his birthday content  I posted previously about not meeting his family here  so we decided to spend the day together for his birthday  The day started out just bad  He started insulting me over a soccer game fifa world cup france vs argentina  Then we got to the restaurant and started nagging me and yelling over Argentina winning the cup again  i told him to stop  I requested a cake with a happy birthday there and because of his nagging he didn t even notice   We got to the nar afterwards  I was asking the nanny if I could pick my daughter up and she took my daughter to a christmas party with her family obviously we were upset  He started yelling at me again and saying how I preferred my friend who baby sat my daughter over him  Then my best friend came over to celebrate his birthday he kept kissing her hand and everything when I asked him if he could stop kissing her hand  he got upset and started yelling at me again  it got to the point where we got kicked out of the bar for his yelling and him pulling my hair  In the car I was with my daughter in my arms he kept trying to kiss me I said no we were over he forced me a bit my lip  My lip is swollen for the bite   I told him we were over and to not touch me  He kept trying to kiss me  I kept saying no  until I pushed him myself from the neck  Anyways he says IATAH for breaking up with him on his birthday   In the original post I guess a couple of people were right about not being able to meet his family being a red flag    Update  thank you everyone for the comments  I feel now less guilty  and I am standing by with my decision  He has been trying to reach out but I have blocked him out of everything Comments  NTA  He is abusive  and you need to keep you and your daughter out of that environment   The fact that he kept trying to force himself on you while you were holding your daughter is creepy So you were at the restaurant and he was yelling at you about FIFA and then you called your nanny who essentially kidnapped your kid  then you called your friend bestfriend and then when you were in the car you had your kid and then he bit you while you were holding your kid in the car   the same kid who was at your nanny s family s xmas party    I m so confused You ll be the asshole if you get back with him NTA dude acted like a complete jerk Def NTA  This guy is clearly an abuser  He yells  use physical force upon you  and cross multiple boundaries and try to  assumed  shame you when you ask him not to  Not to mention  he have no self control  To think hed do such thing in front of a CHILD   Im only saying this once  RUN LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT  This is only an assumption but he seems like one of those crazy exes  So please be careful  And whatever you do  do NOT go back to him  Not only for your safety  its for your daughter as well Nta but he is TA    He screamed for it to happen    What an HEmotional dude    You are better of without him   You and you re child deserve better   Sending lot s of positive vibes and lot s of strenght and also lot s of love  NTA he is lucky he is not in jail on his birthday   You are much better off without him   The sooner the better NTA   He was physically and verbally abusive NTA NTA NTA  What an assholeNTA  He is abusiveNTA 100%   I can t even believe you have enough doubts to ask  This guy is a walking blood red flag  RUN AWAY from him hell no NTA he s a piece of shit he should be in jailNTA  I m glad you broke up with him on his birthday after the way he treated you all day  Fuck him NTA  he sounds like a total swineNTA and if he can t control himself over a World Cup like that  disrespct you the way he did and then being physical with you when you were caring your child well he deserve the break up NTA and this guy is abusive  Dump him ASAP and block him  He should be nowhere near you or your daughter NTA run  run far far away  Controlling like crazy NTA   But he s a terrible man and you should NEVER allow someone like that around your daughter NTA  save that you took this long to break up with this abusive asshole and put your daughter in a situation where she had to be around him NTA   Please tell me you got away from him and will never go backHe’s a women beater  Why are you even there NtaNTANTA  I would also press charges against the lunatic for domestic violence He physically assaulted you  He bit your lip   Press charges  That actually could  be considered sexual assault   Get a restraining order   This dude is BAD NEWSIt seems he thought being abusive for his birthday was not an AH move  He showed you his true colors  Believe that is who he is   You need to keep him far  far away for the safety of you and your daughter  if it s his daughter too  report the bite to the police so you have a record of abuse  Eventually  you may need supervised visits   Good riddance to bad rubbish   It wasn t the day it was his behavior  You did what you had to do  Good luck to you and your daughter as you move forward and put this creep far behind you                             Post Title  AITA for ignoring my brothercontent  my brother  23m  and I  24f  started to ignore each other since my last birthday  December 2nd 2022         Background         Last year I started to live  for a while  at my mum s place for safety reasons  My ex was finally called in by police for interrogations and I didn t want him to pay me a visit afterwards  since he can be a bit violent         I have been honest about the upcoming police report to my ex since the beginning  I told him not to try to get in contact with me after telling him the truth  Since then he has been spreading rumours about me at school  work and around my friends to get his revenge  This left me with a very small social circle  I had to move to another place  quit my job  and stop attending school for my own safety   recently been trying to get things going again         My brother decided not to support me in this period  I have been always the one trying to reach out to him and ask him how he is doing  He has never returned the favour unless he needed something         Back to the issue         For my birthday I wanted to organise something small with the people still around me  My brother didn t respond to any of my messages  This was a bit weird even for him  He normally responds in a couple of days  but this time he just ghosted me  I decided to give up and go for a weekend to London instead with my best friend  I had a very nice birthday and lots of fun         I received a message from my mum the day we would get back  She told me my brother was very sick and had to stay in my room  which made me have to get back to my own apartment  My mum even picked us up from the airport and brought my best friend home         Back at her place my brother was watching the World Cup and wasn t sick whatsoever  My mum eventually told me he would go back the next day and that he only wanted to stay one more day for the world cup         I got a bit angry  since they both knew that I was staying over for safety reasons  I packed my stuff and gave my brother the silent treatment  since I didn t know how to deal with the situation at the moment         I did sent my mum a message the moment I arrived at my place  I told her how this treatment was unfair and felt not supported during the hard times  My mum told me to cut contact if I felt like the treatment wasn t fair         I decided to block my brother for a while  because I didn t want to deal with him while I was still struggling to get my old life back  I even cut contact with my mum for a while as well         My mum and I recently had a conversation about him  His birthday is today and I actually don t know whether to wish him a happy birthday or just to let it be  Last year I helped out planning his birthday dinner and had some nice gifts for him  but since everything that has happened  I don t really feel like putting effort into it  She told me he was angry with me since he had to attend his siblings day at his fraternity alone and he has been going to a therapist because I blocked him  I feel like he should first be part of my life to even call himsef a brother  before he is going to show off about it at his fraternity         So  AITA for ignoring my brother and should I wish him a happy birthday Comments  Your brother acted like a selfish twat during a time when you were going through hell  prioritizing a fucking football match over your safety and well being  The fact he s salty because he had to attend some bullshit fraternity thing alone  Cry me a fucking river  This isn t about birthdays or fraternity shit  it s about being a decent human being and supporting family during hard times  That said  maybe he’s got his own issues  but that doesn t excuse his behavior  If you feel like wishing him a birthday  do it  if not  don t  But do it for you  not him  And no  you re not the asshole here Keep ignoring him  If he really cared about getting in touch with you  he would call you not cry to mommy and have her tell you how sad and lonely he was NTA   He s a piece of shit and  silverest of linings  you found that out early   Now you don t have to ever deal with him again   Hope everything works out and you don t need to seek their help in the future  “When someone shows you who they are believe them the first time ”   ― Maya AngelouI get why you were upset  but cutting all contact with him over it seems a bit excessive    I also think that it was unfair to continue to ignore him  but let your mom back into your life  She’s the one who lied to you about your brother being sick just so he could watch tv in your room  She’s equally  if not more  at fault    I think you should give your brother a chance to apologize for his carelessness in the first place  and in turn apologize for completely alienating him over it    ESHNTA  Go back to LC with your family and concentrate on your own mental health  They do not support you and have no added value to your life  You absolutely should not be dealing with the drama they bring with all the bs going on with the ex   You seem to have good friends  Surround yourself with their positivity  have fun  and take care of yourself  Good luck  Sis                             Post Title  AITA for selling bikinis content  I m writing this because I feel a little crazy for not being able to see the wrong in my actions  I need to know what others think   I ll start this off by mentioning that my  m20  family is currently going through a very rough financial crisis  my dad is currently serving time in jail over debt  and my mom can t work due to being medically retired  Due to this I have put it upon myself to bring in income for my family  I searched online and decided to start a football  soccer  merch store on etsy  Now here s the issue  one of 45 products on my store is an argentina bikini i listed after they won the world cup  it has been selling quite a bit  However  my girlfriend  f19  says that it s weird for me to be selling bikini and to be profiting off it  she has threatened to break up with me if I don t take my listing down even though it has been helping out my store a lot with the sales it brings in  Again I explained to her the income I make from this store isn t even going to me  it s to help my family s financial situation  she says I still have to take it down   TLDR  I m selling bikinis on etsy to make money in order to help out family who s in a ton of debt and my girlfriend is threatening to break up with me if I don t take the listing down   So  am I the asshole for selling bikinis online Comments  No  you are not the asshole  that’s quite a weird hill for her to choose to die on and it seems she may have some insecurities that are coming out  I’d sit down and talk with as an adult and explain that you are just selling the bikinis  You are not getting pictures of the women or sizing it or anything like that you are with her and only her just reassure her that you’re not doing it to be a perv NTA  You can t understand your girlfriend s point of view because you are thinking rationally and she s being ludicrous  Good luck with your family and finances Lol NTA does she not know how many fashion designers are men  If she’d break up with you over having a career she doesn’t approve of she’s not the one  You’re not doing anything wrong NTA  Your girlfriend is controlling  That s a red flag you need to take notice to  Continue what you re doing to help out your family  You are doing absolutely nothing wrong  If she breaks up with you over something so petty that doesn t affect her in any way  shape or form  say good riddance to her  She s ridiculous Did she ever buy anything from Victorias Secret     A dude own Ed s it NTA  I can t even begin to understand why she has a problem with it  It s not like the customers are coming in and you re personally measuring them  Good for you for finding away to help your family She is overreacting to the situation based on her own insecurities  These topics are always worth a conversation  an honest one  if she will have it  I would be prepared for her to continue having a hard time accepting your truth compared to her fears  I wouldn t jeopardize a job  a family security  or a personal stance you feel good about just because she tells you to stop  though  At that point it would be manipulation on her part  and I just believe that leads to tougher problems between you down the road  I d really try to find the root of her feelings  and hopefully Identify and sooth them without a cost to you  I hope she recognizes she is being unreasonable  To me  it becomes weird on her to be fixating on women buying something she would possibly buy herself  She doesn t fixate on this when she shops  does she  Is she super worried men are selling her bikinis  also Break up with her immediately  NTANTA    Another good way to save money quick is to lose the girlfriendNTA  If she wants to break up over you selling bikinis to strangers online  you should let her Nta  Wtf does she think  You will see everyone that buys one online  NTA     Your gf is making this weird  You re helping support your family  There s nothing wrong with that Either your girlfriend is being childish or she is hiding something from you  NTA  My guess from what I have read is that she finds it weird only because you re male  Whatever the case  if you stay in this relationship take in mind she might throw more ultimatums at you 🚩  Good luck with your business NOPE    PLAIN AND SIMPLE Definitely NTA and I really don’t get her weird stance on this either  It’s a bathing suit   If she really wants to break up for it  then you’re dodging a bullet  She’s sounds controlling and ridiculousNTA  Your gf is being completely ridiculous NTA   Are you personally measuring each customer before she buys the bikini   If not  there s nothing wrong with making extra money that way NTA  You shouldn t probably let her break up with you because you don t need her controlling your actions  You are not doing anything wrongNTA   Your gf sounds exceedingly insecure Break up with her   You are trying to take care of your family   It s not like you are helping them try them on  FFS  it s an online sale NTA   it’s weird she has an issue with this as it is just swim wear NTA  Id let her break up with you  You have every right to do what your doing  its not weird and your trying to help your family  Good for you  You can just tell her that your not going to remove the item from the shop  if she wants to leave you  she can  But TBH  her insecurities will just keep coming up like this and she either needs emotional help or you need to exit the relationship  She is upset of something small and is threatening to leave  I can not imagine what she will do when shes upset over something big  Get out while you can NTA   as a woman I can see she is manipulating you already  🚩🚩NTA your selling them not collecting pics of women in them  I m racking my brain trying to figure out why she s got a problem but I got nothing  If she s that controlling you need to reevaluate your relationship Your dad is In prison for debt  What country  What century NTA  you feeding your family and not using the money for yourself   She sounds immature with no empathy  Move on Ask her how many times she’s bought a bikini from a man owned site You’re kinda TAH for thinking you might be  Dump the ingrate and soldier onNTANta nothing even remotely weird about it  hell I’d start selling way more of them if it’s popular and if it’s what the people wantNTA  Let her break up  Your good  for trying to make the money for your family  If she doesnt like it  she can try to make money  But else  selling bikinis isnt something bad NTA   It s more important to feed your family than to have a girlfriend   If she chooses to leave  so be it                             Post Title  AITAH for telling my husband he was feeding our baby wrong content  My  24f  husband  35m  and I have a one year old  15mo  daughter  He works full time and is trying to go back to school  I m the one who does most of the baby care and cooking and cleaning  Before we got married I told him I wanted to be the stay at home mom when we had kids because I knew that he would have liked to be a stay at home dad if I was willing to work instead  He does help with baby care like feeding  bathing  and changing her diaper but I usually am the one to do most of it  especially feeding her   In the last few 2 or 3 months I have been struggling because I don t feel like he is listening when I tell him what I normally feed her  I will give some examples  Several weeks ago he got up early on a Saturday and did her normal morning routine  got her dressed and changed her diaper ect  The only problem was I normally feed her breakfast and then put her in her room to play with a small snack like Cheerios and her sippy cup with water  He didn t feed her breakfast  he just gave her milk and put her in her room to play  I woke up and found out that he got her up for me and thought that was nice and asked what he fed her for breakfast  He said he didn t  he just gave her milk  I was annoyed but I reminded him that she shouldn t just be having milk for a meal anymore  Cow s milk isn t like formula and even if it was formula  she s old enough that she s supposed to be eating real food  I think that should have been enough of a conversation for him to at least not do that specific thing anymore  I was wrong  the very next Saturday he did the exact same thing  No breakfast  just milk  Once she has the milk I can t feed her breakfast anymore because she s no longer hungry  so when he snapped at me and said  if you don t like the way I do things  you can do it yourself   I couldn t really correct it that morning because she wouldn t eat  He hasn t gotten her up in the morning since   Fast forward to yesterday  He came home from work and will often times go play with the baby for a bit before he does homework or other things  This time I asked him to get her up from her nap and  give her some chex and fill up her water   I assumed he did this so when we went in to play with her and then get her some dinner I was confused  Normally I give her plain rice chex or plain cheerios  I don t want her eating too much sugar at this point in her life unless it comes from fruit  He knows this and yet when I walked into her room I smelled the blueberry chex that he had given her  I also noticed that he gave her milk  Recently I have told him that I ve only been giving her milk before nap and bedtime because if I don t she chugs it and won t eat anything else  So he did two things that I know I have told him previously not to do  When I asked him about the chex he said I didn t specify which ones  which is true but I thought that he would have remembered about the sugar thing  Then I asked why he gave her milk when he knows that we only do that before she sleeps and he said to our baby  I m ignoring her    I said  I feel like you don t listen to a word I say   and I promptly grabbed the dishes in her room and left  I went outside to walk our dog in the backyard so I could cool off   After I came in I kinda just ignored him and did some dishes while he gave the baby carrots  I got her a few other things to eat and finished doing dishes  Then we put her to bed and by the next 30 minutes I was talking to him again   The point is am I being too controlling with her food and or a jerk for getting mad at him for seemingly not listening to me   ETA  It seems that many people agree that I am being a wee bit crazy  I will have another discussion with my husband and work out some compromises  I know that he loves our daughter and he is also trying to do what s best for her  She is happy and healthy and that is what is important  I am going to work on relaxing about this because I see that it is not necessary for me to be so uptight about it  Thank you for all the advice   ETA2  since people were asking about my husband wanting to be a stay at home dad  Here was my comment  What I meant by that was if he had married a career woman who wanted kids but was okay with her husband being a stay at home dad  he would have liked that  Or if we lived in a world where anyone and everyone could work at home and he could spend infinitely more time with his children he would have liked that too  I too dreamed about being a mom whose job it was to take care of her children  He decided to allow me to be the stay at home mom because he knows I would be happier doing that than any job I d work  He also knows that he has many interests that he enjoys getting paid to do and I don t   I just felt like that was very long and slightly irrelevant to add to my post but I shall add it because people were wondering about it   ETA3  I have had a discussion with my husband and we got all our feelings out on both sides and both apologized to eachother  We were able to come up with a plan to help us both be happier while managing our baby s food  Thank you for everyone s perspectives  they were helpful to see Comments  You know how you can slow your roll with these things    Ask yourself if whatever it is you’re worrying about that he does  ask yourself if it will be a problem six months from now    If your husband gives your kid milk instead of breakfast once a week while you sleep in  is it going to be a problem in six months  Probably not  because your kid is going to demand breakfast    It’s okay if a parent does something “wrong” once in a while  and that’s a good thing  because it’ll be you sometime  There are lots of ways to be a good parent I understand  but if she’s got a full belly from her milk  she’s ok  She’ll let you know if she’s hungry for more The first baby and everything is organic  all natural and if they hiccup you run to the doctor  The second baby and you re happy to sit down long enough to drink an entire cup of coffee while it s hot and you use whatever is closest to wipe a runny nose  With child number three you take away sharp objects  With child number four you just shrug if they start juggling knives and warn them not to cry when they cut themselves after you ve told them knives are sharp  Chill out  Mom  kids really are amazingly sturdy and resilient but if you hyperventilate every time something doesn t get done  exactly  according to how you ve planned it you ll miss so much of the fun of being a parent   Says someone who raised 8  Expecting his parenting to be directed by your instructions does seem respectful to me  He’s also a parent  Not an assistant to a parent  not a junior parent or a second tier parent  He is one of two  You are one parent  he is the other  If you want to be respected  you have got to be respectful  It’s obviously not your intent to be disrespectful  but it is what it is He’s not your employee  YTA for treating him like a bad babysitter when he is her parent and your equal  You are so condescending that I couldn’t read the whole thing  What you are doing is building resentment and anger  Perhaps you should be the one working and let him be the stay at home Blueberry Chex is a thing  My sister did this until her husband stopped doing anything she didn t specifically say to do  Basically stopped thinking and having normal reactions to stuff needing to be done  Not just with the kids  everything  He got used to not being able to do anything right  so he quit trying  Nice guy  a bit passive  but she ruined him   then of course she complained that he didn t do anything that she didn t tell him  I tell this cautionary tale to all of the young new moms I know My parents rolled completely differently but they never contradicted each other in front of us kids  We ate delicious nutritious meals when it was mom’s night to cook  My dad fed us tv dinners and coca cola in front of the TV   Or pizza with a pitcher of birch beer at the pub  We had the best of both worlds and it sounds like your kiddo will too You are being too controlling with her food   YTA  The thing about the ONLY milk for breakfast is a valid issue   Everything else is just your preference  and NOT actually damaging to your child in anyway    You are arguing over which way the towels should be folded  and that s just irritating on all levels  I said I wanted to be the SAHM because I KNEW HE WOULD WANT TO DO THAT           am I the only one who caught that    You took something he really wanted to do  and now you just nag at him constantly that he does what you want wrong     Must be fun at parties   I m going to assume this is your first kid as this is entirely normal first time parent behavior  But as a guy with 5 kids and a wife that has stayed home with all of them  none of this s   t matters  You ve set up a very detailed and organized plan it would seem  Your husband is going outside of that plan  It doesn t matter  Your kid will be fine  Is he a good dad   Then trust him a bit  All of this sounds like a misunderstanding of your vision or a lack of you understanding that he might have a vision of his own  Maybe he was raised in a way that he has some different perspectives or something he wants to try    Lol  my wife just came in and was reading this response over my shoulder and started giving me a hard time from our first kid after we d brought him home from the hospital  She was breastfeeding for feeding times but I thought I d be helpful and give the little guy one of the bottles of pre made formula we brought home from the hospital  19 years later and she ll still talk smack on a dime  Lol  it ll take time but you ll see just how little all this matters  Enjoy each other  enjoy your kid and find reasons to smile at each other and your baby for no good reason  IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE more than all this other stuff  trust me YTA he’s not going to do things the exact same way as you  You’re knit picking over small details and aren’t looking at the big picture  Was babe fed  safe and take care of… yes   So that’s what matters  He’s her dad and you have to give him an opportunity to actually parent  If you keep acting like this he’s going to shut down and stop trying  So unless you want to be a married single parent  stop it  Are you guys leaving her in her room alone to eat  Please don’t do that  I’m a nanny and i stepped around the corner while my 17 month old was eating and she choked  Not trying to judge  but after that  i try to promote the message when i can   Aside from that  i totally get your frustrations  But all i can say is  if baby is happy  healthy  and loved  it’s okay  Baby can have milk one day with dad and a full breakfast with you  They will let you know if they’re still hungry  trust me  You both are partners and are tackling parenthood together I really fucking commend you for asking  Having children is difficult and stressful especially the early years  Neglecting your partner and marriage is easy to do when stressed and tired  You are being overbearing in this situation  It s sounds like both of you are truly doing your best for this child  Go easy on each other and forgive with compassion this child depends on it It s a known fact that babies absorb all nutrients through their chins  If you put the food in their mouths  it just forces them to go to the trouble of drooling it onto their chins to eat  Most parents still insist on doing it this way though     You’re a control freak and need to give him support  Men parent differently than women and you need to respect that  He loves his child    Stop trying to make him follow your playbook  You’re causing unnecessary drama Chex lol Am I the only one who thinks that it s a horrible idea to give food to a toddler that she can eat without supervision    You mentioned something like   when we went in to play with her    How are you not in the same room as the child   She s just in her room alone I think there s something you both need to understand    she s not a baby anymore  she is a toddler      She requires food  but you are also making a bigger deal out of this than it needs to be  Take a breathe  parenting is hard  Your husband is actually trying  and that should mean everything  Instead you re nitpicking  and you need to chill a bit    Show him your directions from the pediatrician s office  I m sure you have them  At this age your daughter should have 2 3 cups of whole milk a day  Stay close to those limits and she ll be okay  Honestly  even if you don t she ll still be okay    NAHYou know it is his kid also right YTA it’s his baby too  You don’t get to make all the rules Honestly  YTA here  Not only because of the knit picking  But you have a husband who is working  going to school  and still trying to be a present partner and parent  yet you’re   by the sounds of it   constantly telling him that he’s doing something wrong  And the fact that you said you wanted to be the stay at home parent because you knew he would want to sound spiteful  As the stay at home you’re the default parent and the fact that he wants to do anything let alone does it and you’re still criticizing him when he’s doing his best is a major red flag So he got her up in the morning to let you sleep in  you bitch at him and tell him he did everything wrong  but now he won t get her up anymore  I wonder why NAH   I ve been here  First time motherhood makes a lot of women very anxious to be doing everything perfectly all the time  Babies get weighed and there s the assumption that sugar will cause lifelong obesity  And everyone has a damn opinion  even if they shouldn t   In the spirit of one anxious mother to another  I see you and your struggle  OP  You normally hold the reins  you do a good job and it s hard to cede control  But your SO isn t hurting the baby  Sure  he might not be doing it how the experts say  but the experts will change their minds in a year  Meanwhile he s fed the baby milk  not glucose syrup  and the baby is fine  Still growing in fact  Eventually no amount of milk will satisfy her appetite   You can ask your SO to please listen to your experiences  she ll fill up on milk  but you can t be the baby police  Today it will be sugary chex  Tomorrow it will be ice cream or whatever  You need to pick your battles OP  and think  is the baby happy or that expert whom I don t have to live with     For the record  there is no ironclad method of feeding a baby  If they re going to be picky then they will be  If they re fat then they re probably a growth spurt away from  normal weight    The only real nasty is salt YTA  The baby frankly doesn t care as long as her belly is full   Whatever sugar she ingested from the forbidden Chex isn t going to derail her for life   Why you think she needs a snack immediately after eating breakfast escapes me   Having milk is no great problem  as soon as her belly is empty  you ll be feeding her again       This is why men play as if they don t know how to do anything I was you a few years ago  trying so hard to feed my daughter perfectly according to nutritional recommendations and micromanaging everything about her routines  You re doing great  and keep up her schedule and routines but if Dad does it a little different once a week  don t worry about it  Let him help with her because it is so important for their bonding  and the more you criticize the less he will want to help  The most important thing for you and your husband right now is to be kind to each other  Good luck OP  I BEG you  for you  your husband  and especially your daughter  CHILL TF OUT   Hubby not doing  exactly  as you say will not harm your child  However  YOU having strict  food rules  will  Trust me  I m a recovering anorexic with a weird relationship with food  I also lost my little sister to Anorexia  Parents don t realize how much they impact our relationship with food A wee bit crazy  Understatement of the decadeYup  YTA  He parents differently  Not a big deal  Stop being so overbearing and thinking onky your way is the correct way Is this one of those “fake   trying to get a rise” posts  It has all the markings  It gives off a  “why is he mad I keep on poking him in the eye” vibe Yes you are  Chill out   Im a dad and do things different than mom and its ok I hope if you’re giving your baby milk before she sleeps that you’re also brushing her teeth after  If she doesn’t have teeth  you still should be brushing before bed  Make it a habit early so she gets used to it as part of her routine    See how it feels when people lovingly micromanage your parenting   you’re lucky you’re able to be home with your children while he works  You should appreciate him way more for the sacrifices he makes  He’s an active parent  Be grateful So you usually leave the 15 month old in her room with a silly cup and cheerios  Honest question  your not afraid of the baby accidentally chocking You want to be REALLY careful nitpicking everything he does differently than you  Remember there is not one way to parent  You’re not always “right ” He’s not always “wrong ” It’s it ok for you two to do things differently with the kiddo  He will eventually stop helping at all if all you do is tell him he’s doing it wrong all the time  I did it to my husband too much for the first couple years and he just gave up parenting  By the time the kid was 4 we had a huge blowout because he wouldn’t do anything and he told me “that’s how you trained me ”   Don’t make the same mistakes I did  Relax  Dial back the control issues  Accept that you two will do some things differently  This kid won’t die if she eats some sugar cereal once in a while    ALL THAT SAID… He does need to make an effort to make sure he’s feeding the kid healthy food and not just be fun snack and cereal dad all the time  Once in a while is fine  but not all the time  That’s worth a conversation where you need to get on the same page  You also need to look out for weaponized incompetence  If you are not nagging but simply making a request   he throws up his hands and says “fine you do it ” That’s troublesome as well and you two need to work that out with better communication Far too controlling  He isn’t starving her for days on end or abusive  Just accept he will do things different which is fine  She doesn’t need to have breakfast if milk will fill her to her next meal than so be it  The way you are acting around food she will have an eating disorder by the time she hits teens  Ease up a bit everything in moderation YTA   why you acting like this is the end of the world  Stop being so possessive and let him do what he wants with his daughter I understand the being particular about a child’s diet   The weird part for me is you just feeding her processed carbs as her main food source in the mornings and then being bent out of shape that he fed her the blueberry type instead of the plain kind     Like  There’s way better things to be feeding your toddler…  I’d understand if you asked him not to feed her that kind of food at all  but that’s not what’s happening here  Idk if this is the hill i would die on gurl😭😂It was after her husband died that my mother realized that it was more important that he helped and less important that he did it differently    I think everyone should keep this in mind before divorcing their spouse over minor details YTA  You’re being way too controlling  As a dad who is just as involved with my kids as their mom  you sound exhausting and you’re just pushing him away I have a bigger problem with leaving a child unattended with foods that are known coking hazards  I think you’re worried about the wrong thing  Also  moms and dads parent differently  So he doesn’t do it your way  Is she being properly nourished  If yes  move on  You are acting a little unhinged here  So I’m gonna have to go with YTAishRoutines and healthy eating habits are paramount at this age to teach to children    NTAI barely remember breakfast on Saturdays I do remember it was never hotu guys are not in sync Having a real conversation instead of criticizing would help a lot   A friend of mine used to complain her husband never helped her   I was sympathetic until I saw how she treated him when he didn’t do something the way she would   I wouldn’t help her either if the response was criticism  mockery and sexism  “men just don’t get it”    That’s nonsense   Pick your battles   If the kid was allergic to blueberries and your husband still fed the kid blueberry Chex  then obviously that’s worth a battle   The husband feeding the kid blueberry Chex in this case   not so much   You both do need to figure out how to parent together and that means being adults and having actual conversations and listening to each other You guys need to work on your co parenting skills  or it will hurt you as a couple  I think you both did something wrong  You should let him participate without feeling like he s doing something that he s not a part of normally  he should listen to you for guidance as he s often not been involved YTA    Put yourself in his place  First  realise that he has a fragment of the time you have with your child  He wants to invest the time he does have as good as he can  He’s trying to be the best dad he can   Secondly  he’s sending you strong signals that he wants to learn and make experiences on his own  rather than just take directions from you  You might be thinking you already figured it out  but if you consider the first point  you’ll realise it’s more about giving him space to experiencing being a dad for his daughter  rather than about what’s the “best” way tl fo things   Don’t rob him of that experience  Right now you might think you know better  but him getting to learn the daddy life in his way will come back in multiples as years go on  He’s bonding with your daughter  figuring out her needs for himself is part of that   You can still talk to him about it  But it’s needs to be a calm and open conversation You have to understand that neither of you know what you’re doing  you just think you have a better grasp because you do it more often  You’ve made far more mistakes than he has  but you make fewer mistakes on average   The thing is  no matter what the mistake is  as long as he’s not physically harming the child it’s likely not worth more than a simple reminder without fighting about it  “Hey babe  please no blueberry Chex…or at least like 1 5 with the plain rice Chex”This mom is crazy My biggest concern is that the daughter is put in her room alone to play and have a snack  What if she chokes Your micromanaging his parenting  YtaI did do all kinds of things with my son that my wife doesn’t  Why  Because we’re different people and different parents  If you agree on morals and want to raise a good child  that is all that matters  You’re being anal  It sounds to me like he’s working his ass off in life and probably enjoys feeling like he’s doing something special with his kid  Take a step back and stop being a fucking robot YTA   Life does not need to be a strict regiment from dawn to dusk  Relax those rules and enjoy your family As someone  27 M  with a full time job  studying part time and a toddler  I can relate  and I can say that you are being kinda the AH    Understand where you’re coming from but in all he’s just trying to help  He is not neglecting the baby in any way  Understand you have a well established routine for your baby and thats great  But you need to realize that that routine is yours  every day  not his  What does it matter if he does things a little different sometimes  What really matters is that the baby is healthy and happy    Allow some flexibility in the babys routine  not everything needs to be so strict  Let your husband be a dad  not just the guy that takes care of your baby sometimes Yta  Ease up mama  You sound like a crazy lady I m sorry    im stuck on the fact that baby girl seems  by the way the post is written  like she eats in her room all by herself   and spends a lot of time in there alone as well  These feedings sound like you are feeding a pet Ijs  Look I’m a mom too and like things done a certain way but you are too over the topI wouldn’t say you’re an AH but if I was in your husbands shoes I would feel like you’re trying to parent me as well as the baby  Just relax and let your hubby do things his way while he gets a chance to help you relax  He’s doing this for you too and I’m sure that’s why it’s even more frustrating for him to be told he’s wrong deleted YTA  your man is hands on  He loves his daughter  and he wants to spend time with her  He s also getting up so you can get extra rest   And you are mad he doesn t feed her exactly how you would  Do you want to never have a break   He isn t going to be motivated to do anything if all you do is yell at him  Stop  take deep breaths  and let him make some choices as her dad YTA  You gotta let some things go  My husband doesn’t feed our 9 month old exactly what I do or when I do  Baby had cheese and peaches for breakfast  Cool I don’t care as long as he is giving him appropriately safe food and his bottles  My husband also doesn’t sing to him in the tub or put on lotion or oil after  I do not it doesn’t matter  Things that involve safety we 100% agree on  But you need to relinquish some control  I know I had anxiety and wanted to control everything in the beginning  I had to force myself to step back and let dad do his thing  And I took a 2 hour nap today while dad played and took care of him  If you don’t allow him to try he will stop trying Well you wont be able to control what he feeds his daughter when its his days to have her in the 50 50 custody  I can hear the NAGGING through my screen  Like   let up  Shes HIS daughter too  NONE of what he did endangered her at all  You sound controlling and abrasiveI only read half of your storry and yeah you sound like the a hole  Let dad do some parenting of his own  Sure you do it more often but if he s not hurting the baby let him try things his way l  Before we got married I told him I wanted to be the stay at home mom when we had kids because I knew that he would have liked to be a stay at home dad if I was willing to work instead   Edit  On rereading my response was too harsh   I do think it s worth rediscussing this though  He wanted to be a stay at home dad and you seem to have called  dibs   making sure you got what you want and he didn t  Now he s working  going to school  and still being an active father  You may benefit from time out of the house even at a part time job  I worry your whole life revolves around the child  which isn t wrong  but it can make issues seem bigger than they are Yeah you need to chill tf out kid  your baby will be fine This is why guys don’t help  Nothing is ever good enough  YTA What are Cheerios where you live  Because here  France  they re cereals that are full of sugar    Actually many cereals are just that  sugar on top of sugar so I am super confused about your choices    As for your husband  it sounds like he doesn t care about what you say because you are over controlling  But he also is not reacting the right way to that  So ESH YTA   Your baby is just fine  I think he s fine  I think you re fine too  You let your baby off the tit  You gotta let your husband off the tit too  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣   Seriously  though  if you can t let go of your feeding preferences  try reframing your argument  Ask for his help in achieving   something  so that  reason   Much better approach than nagging  attacking  and accusing He’s not an employee  he’s your partner and father  He may not do things as you do but that’s OK isn’t it  Your baby’s overall health is just fine so why sweat the small stuff   YTAMy wife learned not to harass me about details  because it s OK for parents to do things differently    When she would feed the kids  it was a nicely cooked meal    When I fed them  it was lunch meat  apple slices and carrots or beans or some other veggie  Looked like shit  Not much work  Generally hit the food groups    It was fine  Kids liked it better usually  She d roll her eyes and smile    Your way isn t the only way  Dad isn t your employee This is a thing between men and women where the woman wants help from the man  then criticizes the way the man does it    It s his child too  If the worst that comes from this is the baby fills up on milk when you would rather her eat other food as well for a few meals a week  then that s not a tragedy to pick a fight over You should ask for advice in the parents sub  this one is a bunch of 14 year olds  It’s perfectly reasonable to want the father of your child to be able to feed her a healthy breakfast on a regular basis  15 months is well past ‘milk for breakfast’ territory  and an involved parent would know that  What you’re asking isn’t crazy and him refusing to help because you dare ask is an issue  You shouldn’t even have to ask  he should care enough to know what’s appropriate and feed her that  He doesn’t get a pass for waking up one out of seven days  He’s not doing you a favor  He’s parenting  it’s both your jobs I’ll have a completely unpopular opinion here so I’ll just say  you’re doing your best in a very high anxiety new situation and your opinions are valued don’t let anyone make you think they aren’t  I wish you all the best 20F  30M  stay at home mom  dysfunctional relationship  Name a more iconic AITA first sentence YTA    Sorry to say it   He is her father just as you are her mother   He was brought up differently than you and thus has a different parenting style than you and that is ok   Ask your self this is my daughter happy  safe and loved  If the answer is yes then don t worry about it    He has a right to pass along the way his parents raised him   Trust your husband you did marry him and decide to become parents together He s not feeding her  wrong   she s not going to die  or even be malnourished  She s fine  He s not doing the ideal thing  it s suboptimal  but it honestly doesn t matter  She s fine  he s fine  life is shockingly short  don t fill your days arguing over minor inefficiencies   Like the other commenter said  none of this will matter in 6 months even if you never said anything about it As a dad  I honestly forgot half your rules by the time I finished reading  If you were saying this to me I d have a little money with cymbals in my brain We had a discussion about kids  drinking cow s milk in one of my college classes  instructor was a former USDA food inspector  As it turns out cow s milk has the ability based on nutritional content to be the only food component known in the human diet to be the sole source for adequate nutrition until around age 12   In other words a child can survive by drinking only cow s milk from about age 2  or when weaned  until age 12  or just after puberty   You sound fun  Calm down and let dad figure it out YTA  while I understand the point of why you’re upset  it’s not a huge deal and won’t have any negative effects  These kind of things are exactly what caused a lot of arguments between me and my wife when we first had our daughter  My wife has been a SAHM until recently  so she’s been the primary parent especially because of my work schedule  sometimes gone days at a time   When I’m home  I try my best to give her a break  and also spend as much time with my daughter and it sounds like that’s what he’s trying to do  The best piece of advice we received was to let me make my own “mistakes”  obviously not including safety concerns  and learn my own ways to parent  Constant correction comes off as nagging and will push most men away and shut us down  just kind of our nature as we don’t want to feel inadequate  As long as the kid is happy and not screaming they’ll be okay  While we still have small arguments here and there since parenting and life in general is stressful hard  it’s improved significantly and so has our relationship  If you can try to take that approach  it will be better for all parties involved YTA  Your child isn’t starving to death  You are starting drama for no reason  You sound like my racist grandmother who rearranged the forks for desert because she wants it done her way but tells us to help set it up Milk instead of actual breakfast  that s a problem  NTA   Giving blueberry Chex mix instead of plain  My man is doing gods work and saving you from having an extremely picky eater  Variety is key  Don t limit your child to a super strict diet 24 with a 35  minus 2 years  15 month old with about 9 months pregnancy  made you 22 with a 33 year old   Gives me the ick Yeah I get what you’re saying about sugar  But there is 8 grams of sugar in the blueberry Chex and 2 in the Rice Chex  it’s not a lot of sugar  You’re being a little crazy about it   Why would you ever expect him to help when all you do is pick him apart  He’s allowed to make decisions too  You’re discounting him as a parentYTA yes  you are being too controlling  You ve decided your way is not just the right way  but the only right way  and that s not really how this works  He s her parent too  he gets to make decisions too  You re complaining about ridiculous things  He s giving her milk and caring for her  Her belly is full and she should be drinking a lot of milk at her age  He s not wrong  It s not just your kid NTA  Lots of non parents in here crapping on you for being mad that your husband   did not feed your child  twice       He needs to grow up and actually feed his kid  Soft Y T A for the blueberry Chex thing  but the milk thing he’s just being an asshole Criticism doesn t exist in a vacuum  How often it is done is 90% of its acceptibility  Don t be Chicken Little  pick your battles  and the times you do take issue will be treated with seriousness and consideration inversely proportional with the frequency that you take issue Nta but controlling everything like that is going To get exhausting  If he’s not harming her you have to learn to let go a little  Coming from one SAHM to another you’ll save yourself a lot of grief YTA  This is… exhausting  You gotta lighten up  How many posts do we read about a man child who won’t lift a finger and the wife has to do literally everything  Your husband is clearly a devoted husband and father  And he has just as much of a right to determine things like what snack to give your daughter as you do  And i use “your” in the plural sense  She is his daughter too  Parenting is hard  so don’t make it harder on yourself  You have a partner in this  don’t push him away and make him question his parenting  This rigid helicopter parenting is not sustainable and you’re gonna suck the joy right out of the limited time he has to spend with her  Put your feet up and read a book or something when he is spending time with her  and don’t rain on his daddy daughter time   ETA  I’ve read through a lot of comments  and I really commend you for your humble attitude  and your willingness to see your own assholery and make some changes  You really were looking for perspective  not validation  It makes me not hate the entire internet for a few minutes Stop micromanaging  YTA Can you say  control freak    I knew you could   NTA  He should know how and what she is eating by this point and be able to follow through with the routine  Look up weaponized incompetence Your husband seems like an immature jerk to me  How hard is it to know what to feed your kid  NTAIgnore the people telling you you re wrong  The blueberry cereal thing you probably can let go  but just giving a baby milk instead of food isn t ok  His reaction also isn t ok  Instead of trying to compromise or work with you  he just decided not to do anything  He s doing this on purpose to make you do all the work  it s called weaponized incompetence  I m pretty sure this sub has been taken over by teens who don t have kids and are mostly maleYTA   you said nothing in your post about the baby being unhappy   You were unhappy because your rules weren t followed   That s a bit controlling   If you baby is fed  dry and happy then bite your lip and go on   BTW    even cows  milk is far more nutritious than cereal and young children need the extra fat for their growing brains   Edit  TypoThis isn’t controlling so idk what people are on about  From what I’ve learned giving kids new foods is recommended but also is ensuring they’re eating adequate and appropriate servings and foods    As well as ROUTINE  if he does thing a one way even after he was calmly explained why  and he continues to do the easy way out not only will the kid learn that daddy will not be reliable to feed her  she will also learn to not eat properly    My SIL did the same  her kid is two and she constantly gives the chap milk as a fast food option and so when we give him appropriate food he won’t eat it  Only drink milk and she’s struggling to get him to eat properly    It’s important both parents are on board when it comes to minding their developing children’s nutrition  She’s not saying the kid can only eat gluten sugar free organic only foods  just that she eats actually food for breakfast and milk for certain times    Also managing a kids sugar intake while not entirely prohibiting it can ensure they have a healthier association to processed foods of all sorts instead of disordered eating growing up    The father isn’t try to understand why OP does what she does  and y’all are shaming a mother ensuring her kid is eating properly   If he were genuinely concerned about the feedings  he’d ask why she does what she does and suggest they talk to the pediatrician    But he immediately went defensive and has opted out entirely of doing any parenting  Which says a lot  And that’s what makes HIM the asshole  NOT OP You have some serious OCD   but you are born with it   what can you do  YTA    Babies know who is feeding them and the differences  Just like they figure out bottle and breast   You need to let go and let him have his time with his daughter  She is not in any danger If you don t want your kid to have sugar  read the ingredients on cereals  Cheerios is full of sugar   I m going to go with YTA just because of that As a fellow parent  NTA  Nutrition is really important at such a young age  especially in terms of sugar and sleep schedules  If it gets too messed up  you could end up with a ton of other problems  I suggest making a list that has the foods your baby can have and when and post it in the kitchen to help your husband  since he clearly won’t listen Remember this   just because someone does something different  doesn t mean it s wrong    You need to learn how to pick your battles    Having only milk 1 day a week for breakfast while I get to sleep in   not worth it in my opinion NTA  Look up weaponized incompetence NTA  I know this is against everyone else’s opinion but I have to say this is a sign of disrespect from your husband   He doesn’t have to follow your every request but he knows you’ve been taking care of her and how she gets along best then decides to mess up her schedule I think out of spite for you telling him how to do things  The breakfast menu or milk instead of water isn’t really going to hurt her  I hope he will have at least some regard for your opinion as her primary caregiver and not son this with important issues  Imo he doesn’t respect you and has to feel powerful so he won’t follow your advice If you don’t want your kids have blueberry Chex   don’t have them in the house  Your husband is doing just fine  You can’t micromanage everything he does  Because then he will just stop doing anything  Is that really what you want   YTAYta  It s way too controlling with this  The first time may have been an issue  and you guys can really start talking about it  Talking  not arguing   The rest of the time  you were being controlling and passove aggressive   Stop what you re doing before you say something and ask yourself how you would feel if he said what you re about to say  Doesn t feel good  does it    It s time to do some repair work  My recommendation is to sit down with him  Start the  I feel  convo and get him on his  I feel  too  If it devolves  it might be time for some therapy  Objective observers do well at spotting the trouble “I’m ignoring her” “I feel like you don’t listen to a word I say” Breh he literally said he’s not listening to you…I’d ignore your ass too with all the micro managing you’re doing  This post is irritating I just wanted to let you know that you are not alone  It’s hard to parent  when your partner doesn’t do what you feel is right  as the mother  I am a mom to a 9 month old and have a hard time with my husband  but at the end of the day he is going to learn on his own  He doesn’t do all the things I do  I am just grateful for his help at this point  As long as it’s not dangerous  it’s fine  He’s learning and there is no perfect way to parent YTAYTA  It’s his kid too  what if you don’t feed her how He wants Be happy he wants to be involved and give him a little leeway and tell him thanksTL DR   The answer is YES  YATAH in this Also  you  you must take the Longview because he might be trying to do Weaponized incompetence to get out of helping   If it’s not harming the baby and it’s just not what you would do let it go  Let him parent his way You can do all this now but by the time she s 5 she s going to only eat chicken nuggets   tater tots  cereal  milk   PBJ occasionally   and cheese sticks   From the mom of 3 who wishes her kid would eat ANYTHING ELSE at this point in her life   Don t sweat the small stuff mama  She ll made her own demands sooner rather than later Your kid s nutrition is worth a little turbulence  If this stuff is changing all the time he needs to pay attention  Helpers who are being oh so selfless and pitching in need to do the job that needs doing  not make a gesture in the general direction of feeding the kid Blueberry Chex exists  Where can I buy it  Sorry  op  very excited at this revelationNAH   Should you chillax a bit  Sure  But I also suspect that husband is so defensive not because he thins his way is better but because  he doesn’t know the way   And he likely feels guilty when you remind him of his shortcomings as a parent  as he clearly doesn’t know what his child’s routine is at all   Have a conversation so that you’re both on the same page about what when how the kid will get fed  It’s easier to hold people to standards when they’re explicit At least he is trying  I agree that he should be more receptive  but if you re coming at him in attack mode  he s more likely to just block it out  Some peoples  husbands don t even give their kids the time of day  He didn t give her honey before one or a potential allergen or anything potentially hazardous  Not going to say YTA bc I understand the frustration  especially as a FTM  but do learn to come at it from a different angle or not get very worked up about it  There is a lot of pressure on moms these days due to social media  I m in baby led weaning groups and scientific evidence groups and they are a bit uptight tbh  You sound almost in the same vein in your post  no offense You sound like a great mom  Dad sounds like a great dad  As parents we have to try our best and trust our gut but realize life isn t textbook   If dad gave her soda for breakfast  then you freak out  You will drive yourself crazy trying to control everything and drive a wedge between you and hubby  Healthy eating is important but it s ok to have a treat sometimes   Sometimes with SOs you have to change your approach   more gentle and less accusatory and controlling   You ll probably get better cooperation   It s good practice for when your kiddo gets older too   Lady  you doing too much  Let him feed her what he wants  He too is her parent NTA  if the kid eats breakfast everyday… then he should be making her breakfast  Yeah I see how people think it’s not a big deal once in a while  but he’s just legit ignoring what you asked of him    The chex thing I can easily see happen and wouldn’t be mad at If you want him to help you  let him do it his way  He s not endangering the child in any way  You can have your way of doing things and he can have his way of doing things YTA  Calm down  Seriously     When our first came along  there was this    I dunno    intensity about doing things a certain way  because  blahblahblah       When the second came around  we just wanted to make sure he wasn t trying to eat cat hair or random things off the floor     Your kid s gonna be fine if she s not fed exactly the same way from one day to the next My wife is also a stay at home mom and sometimes when I come home from a long day or it’s my turn on the weekends  I just want to be a dad  Not have to worry about following instructions or doing them in the wrong order  Just be a dad  Make choices  fuck up  learn from them  grow  be better  I understand where you’re coming from the same way I understand where my wife comes from  Mama bear has a routine and wants it followed  Understandable  Just know your husband is trying and doing his best  Especially working full time and going to school  while trying to be the perfect husband and father it can definitely be hard  Not that it’s easy for you either but parents deserve more slack than they get…I wish you luck with your situation WOW  Calm down crazy pants   Yes  you are being very controlling  The things you gave as examples are just not a big deal  She shouldn’t have ONLY milk anymore for nutrition  but that doesn’t mean no milk  Milk is fine  A couple of glasses of it is fine throughout the day  Skipping breakfast or filling up on milk at breakfast  is fine  Eating blueberry checks instead of plain is fine    My toddler will eat nothing but cheese and pumpkin seeds some days  Others she gets beautiful meals and eats every piece of broccoli and tries every interesting well balanced morsel I put on her plate  It’s all fine  Loosen up a bit and don’t suck all the joy out of parenting  Your husband gets to parent too  It’s not all your call YTA   It sounds to me like it is more important to you to be right over anything   I guess maybe only your way is the right way  and if he does things his way  the baby will die    Let it go and let him learn    If you control everything he does  you will have two choices    you can have 2 children or be divorced  and he will do things his way Your baby is going to be fine  You are going to be fine  Your husband is going to be fine  Just because you and your husband parent differently  doesn t mean either one of you is parenting the  right  way or  wrong  way  Let your husband be a parent in his own way  He has your baby s best interest in his heart Not being an AH but super controlling  yes  I was like this with my first  And then my second came along and she ate food off the kitchen floor and mud pies    Baby will be alright  Relax  mama  Maybe look into some counseling for yourself that’ll help you calm down a bit Just reading this gave my eye a nervous twitch…if this is the worst problem you two ever face raising your child then you have it made in the shade   Lighten up a little bit and try to meet in the middle  Men have selective hearing issues  I’ve been married 25 years  have grown daughters  and an 11month old granddaughter  The first baby is always the hardest  but if you learn as you go together you will grow as parents and partners in life Yeah  YTA  I’d chill so you’re not a single parent  That shits real hard  No one is doing shit for you then This isn’t about the milk  the water  the Chex  any of it  It’s about his refusal to listen to you  and then making inconsiderate passive aggressive comments to you through your child  You deserve a partner who will give you the respect of hearing you and adjusting to something that matters to you  in this case  you know better than he does  and you have your well founded reasons for your MOs  Instead  he’s boycotted getting up with her…instead of learning to do it right  NTA  my love I knew you were the issue as soon as you said your daughter is 15 months   Normal people stop counting months around 11 months  After that  it is years  Year and a half  2 years  2 and a half  5  6  7     I am glad you realize you are a bit much and are going to take steps to calm it down   I promise you  controlling every aspect of your child s life so strictly will result in a very rebellious and dangerous teenager and adult   I am proof of that to a degree   Got pregnant at 18 just to get the hell out of my mother s control I’ll say NTA  He’s not listening to you at all  It doesn’t really matter how harmful these are or if they aren’t at all  it seems a bit disrespectful to just outright ignore instruction like that  I don’t think it’s controlling   babies have sensitive stomachs and I know personally I like to introduce things a little at a time to assure there’s not going to be any stomach or sleep issues from it    I think you can both be appreciative of the help while also being frustrated that the help is disrupting a routine you’ve developed    Side note  my perspective is coming from being very tired from dealing with a baby with a disrupted routine  so I may be a little biased lol NTA because milk is not a miracle cure for shortness  How about a balanced mealThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends children under 2 have zero added sugar  Rice Chex have 3 grams of sugar while Blueberry Chex contain 8 grams  Perhaps you can compromise with your husband 1 day a week let him give her the flavored cereal since you aren’t following the guidelines either  Maybe prepare her soppy cup and breakfast the night before if it’s so important that he stick to the routine  But deviating from the  routine isn’t always a bad thing  YTAOf course it s an age gap relationshipBeing a parent is hard  being a parent along with someone else is harder  I ve only ever co parented  husband and I split two weeks after baby was born   and I ve had to learn to just be okay with the fact that dad has his way of parenting  I have mine  This milk vs breakfast  plain cereal vs blueberry isn t what s important  You may not like what he does  but that s okay  He s not intentionally harming baby  he plays with her  he s taking care of her  That s what is important   Dads are typically a lot looser with rules  He ll probably do a lot of things that annoy you because you are being a strict  health conscious parent while he is the more  fun  parent  And that s okay  It s honestly a great balance for your kid   I would honestly say NTA  nobody is the AH here  However  if this continues to be a problem and baby is still happy and healthy  I would seek some sort of counseling for yourself YTA and sound very controlling   I don t think a 15 month old child needs to have such a regimented diet   A  full serving   1 cup  of blueberry Chex has 8g of sugar compared to 3g in rice Chex or 2g in Cheerios   I doubt your daughter is eating a full cup  so you re causing all of this conflict over a couple grams of sugar once in a while   Lighten up before you drive your husband away and give your daughter food issues Relax Karen   The baby will be fine   control freak     YTA  He works full time and then has more work to do after work  and is clearly trying and wants to spend time with the little one  Cut him some fucking slack holy smokesYou might be fixating on the details a bit much here  which is understandable seeing as you are so young and this is your first kid  but I really don t like the way he shut you down  Does he do this often  Why can t he use his words to say he disagrees with you  or he feels that you are overbearing  That  along with the age difference really does not paint a pretty picture for me here   I would consider this a red flag  I would read up on some common manipulation tactics and perhaps read some posts from people who were abused by older partners and see how their partners acted so you know what to be on the look out for  It doesn t hurt to be knowledgable  though you do tend to notice things you ve just learned about a lot more than normal  so that might throw your perception off  What about the people around you  What do they say about him  It might be worth going around and asking what people think of your relationship  get some outside perspective  doesn t mean you have to take what they say as gospel  but you could take it into account at least   If I were your partner and you were being very particular about our baby  I would approach you with all the warmth and understanding in the world  I would be very insistent that you stop  but I would also want you to feel that it was okay to let your guard down  that you would feel comfortable doing so  That s not what it sounds like your partner is doing  it in fact sounds like he s doing the opposite You are being a bit controlling  Not horrible  but a bit  I m not going as far as saying TAH    but also NTAH either     Ok  So  he gave her the wrong kind of chex  She still had a snack  Trust me  I have multiple teens now  People are going to give her snacks and treats you don t want  It happens  She is a toddler  They literally eat crumbs off the carpet and dirt   In terms of milk  Actually  the worst time to give milk in before naps and bedtime  Dairy milk has copious amounts of sugar  and when left on the teeth  it causes massive tooth decay  Babies toddlers that are left with bottle or sippy cups for bedtime are significantly more likely to have tooth decay    If it is really that important to you  write or print out lists of appropriate snacks or meals and put it on the fridge  You have a husband willing to help  That is much more than many moms have    Lastly  please don t leave your child in a room with any kind of good unattended at their age  I m not totally sure if that is happening  I m a little confused about the  put her in her room to play and with chex  statement  But  just wanted to include it in case other parents are reading and may do that YTA for putting a baby in a room  to play  with food that is incredibly dangerous  Kids need supervision when eating  You are also too controlling unless he is feeding known choking hazards let him do his thing Relax mama 🧘‍♀️Sounds like even though you wanted to be the one to stay home with your kid  you don t feel as important for doing it  You re treating your husband as a worker at a daycare you own and run and not as a father who has as much say  You re trying to establish your own importance by micromanaging how he parents    YTAYou need to get out more  lol  There is more to life than dictating your child s life 24 7 NTA  Sounds like weaponized incompetence to me  How many times do you need to tell your partner about routine changes and diet changes before he listens  Milk for breakfast is not enough for your kiddo  Don’t listen to everyone telling you that you’re being crazy  You’ve literally talked to him about this over and over again  I would say the Chex thing was a reasonable mistake  but the rest  A grown man should be able to listen about what changes his child is making developmentally  Especially if he doesn’t do the majority of the childcare and it can effect her daily schedule I think that having the baby on a schedule routine is important and you are with her 24 7 so I think you deserve a say  I also would feel like I wasn’t being heard in the relationship if I were you  It just feels like he’s doing what is convenient for him  not the baby I mean I think NTA and it sounds like feigned weaponized incompetence 🤷 even when you re the dad you should be invested in the nutritional needs and requirements of the children in your home and aware of how to best feed them for their needs and health  and when it s so simple because someone has laid it out for you  follow through  It may just be once a week or whatever but he shouldn t just be skipping breakfast for the only freaking morning he s responsible for his kid  and you deserve to feel you can rest and he d care for your child well  I haven t even read the comments yet but I m preparing myself for all of the folks who will excuse him 🙄ESH  The blueberry chex thing is an honest mistake  but the milk thing is irritating  Overall  y’all just need to communicate more on your expectations for what to feed your daughter together  This shouldn’t be just you deciding stuff and relaying it to your husband  You should both have a very clear understanding of how you want your child to eat moving forward  Don’t just allow him to give up and don’t just allow yourself to say  “I’m being too harsh  I’ll back off”  Have a real conversation I feel like this is a little complicated  Although  being so strict with a babies diet is a little much  they still need routine and structure at a very young age  So falling out of that routine can be detrimental for a young child  Now the part that bothers me is when you were talking to him and although the baby doesn’t understand it’s still very underhanded for him to look away from you and tell a baby that he’s ignoring you  At that point it’s like he’s doing out of spite  The whole “if you don’t like how I do it then do it yourself” is a cop out so he can be the fun parents and you’re the strict parents  You both need to be on the same level of parenting  There should be no separation in which parents is fun and which parent makes rules  Coparenting isn’t just for couple who are separated  That’s why it’s called CO parenting  Just because you stay home doesn’t mean all the responsibility has to fall on you and he only gets “fun time” with the baby  He is also a parent which means he needs to be the parent not the fun uncle It’s your first kid  all parents are weird with their first kid  The last kid you have you will give zero fks about silly stuff like this  You are young  it’s the first kid and it’s common…  no harm no foul NTA op “I’m not listening to her” like come on dude you are a 35 year old man your wife is already raising one toddler stop acting like oneChex and Cheerios are garbage foods  Your child is not a dog  Give her fresh fruits and vegetables  milk  cheese    sheesh You are not TAH BUT you are controlling  It’s ok most new mothers are  But I think you should let your husband feed her the way he sees fit and you do you  You will regret being the micromanager  Eventually he will let you do everything because he will feel incompetent  Let go  Relax  Be happy he wants to be an involved father Does your husband use weaponized incompetence in other areas too   Before we got married I told him I wanted to be the stay at home mom when we had kids because I knew that he would have liked to be a stay at home dad if I was willing to work instead    Everyone just glossing over this part   YTAYTA  Get a job and help your husbandMmmm I think you need to calm down a bit Please sit down w him and make a daily chart  Add in what is expected to be fed  You want him to organically know this but nobody does Train him   Best you can hope forI m going to go with NTA  but neither is your husband   I have two young kids  6 months and 2 5 years   and I m the dad in this scenario   I work a normal 9 5 M F  but my wife works a crazy schedule in the Healthcare field   It took a lot of getting used to  but it works  and we rarely need child care because our schedules are so different   Sometimes I get the kids up  more often she does though   It s about 50 50 who puts them to bed   Every other week she does 13 hour shifts on Sat and Sun  so I have them from the time they get up until I get them to bed   The weekends she doesn t work  we re both with them   We set baselines we both agree on as far as getting them up and getting them to bed  but when one of us is taking care of them without the other  it s that person s discretion   You have to trust your partner  and if you can t  that s a problem you need to work on   I know she s doing to do the right things to take care of them  and she knows I will too   We don t question each other  we re just glad to see each other and hang out as a family when the schedules allow You should divorce him for thisYTA  You are micromanaging dad  The fastest way to get him to stop investing his time and effort is to tell him he’s spending his time with his baby wrong  What he’s doing is right enough for baby and that’s important if you ever hope to have the kind of husband and father that will take the kid off your hands for 20 minutes when you’ve been overstimulated  So enjoy his time with the baby and stop fretting over what he’s doing because you’ll never get a break if you’re watching dad like a hawk  More importantly  he also has baby’s best interest at heart  so let him express that in his own way Im glad your accepting your vote of asshole but I don’t think I’ve seen you mentioning an apology to your husband  You need to apologize if you haven’t already  You probably made him feel like shitAbsolutely NTA  Half of these comments are sexist BS  He isn’t parenting “differently ” He is doing auto pilot parenting and ignoring the guidance of someone who has actually done research and made informed decisions about baby care as a result I googled this since I don t have a kid and don t know the specifics about child development and food  Apparently you need to be introducing foods at 6 months in order to ensure they get proper nutrition for growth and development because breast milk and formula isn t enough anymore   6 12  it should be a hybrid  From 12 months onwards  your baby should be getting most of their nutrition from eating 3 small meals a day  They can still supplement with milk  but food is more important    So your husband the arsehole for not paying attention to this  if he s too lazy to do a quick search he has to accept that you re the one who is willing to do it for him    If he did his own search  then he s well within his rights to call you out on being quite intense about the way you talk about the specifics of what she s eating  But it sounds like he likes the lazy option and you re getting stuck on details because you don t know how to get him to take this seriously  I know people who get ignored by their partners so they start over explaining in hopes of being heard  Is this why you re so fixated on details or is it more to do with the baby   People are acting like he s doing so much as a father  when in reality you should be able to expect to leave your child with him and know your child will be fed properly  You re telling him how to do it  trying to help him  and he s ignoring you  If you ended up in an emergency or at the hospital  he can t make sure your child is taken care of    Maybe this is weaponised incompetence and he isn t feeding your baby because he can t be bothered watching her eat to make sure she doesn t choke or he doesn t want to deal with the mess so he d rather wait for you    You need to talk to him and find out if he s genuinely clueless or if he s actively doing this  Make sure you don t get stuck in the small details during the discussion  NTA I don’t think that you’re the AH  I think he needs to pay attention more  I agree that you need to have another sit down conversation and maybe he needs to attend a nutrition class or read some information about how to properly feed children  He needs to be more cognizant of her health and if he can’t do that  I’d be a little concerned  The blueberry Chex is minor  in my opinion  but it’s the lack of feeding her that worries me Weaponized incompetence  That s what he is doing  It s a favorite tactic of men to get out of being responsible for tasks that they deem beneath them or too  womanly    My ex did this all the time  He would purposely do things incorrectly so that I would take over the duties he didn t want to do  and it led to such an imbalance in our house  I ended up doing 100% of the cleaning and child care despite us both working full time    I divorced him this year  Never made a better decision than that  Mostly because he was a serial cheater  but the weaponized incompetence was a huge factor too Chex and all the cereals you think are plain are loaded with sugar and aren’t healthy at all  Also you’re nitpicking your husband and trying to be right about everything child care related  Eventually he will not want to do childcare activities because you will have convinced him he can’t do anything correctly That age gap Omg and had his baby…YTA for posting a story this lame in AITAH So obviously your first kid  You’re lucky he’s into it  Cut him some slack NTA  Stopped reading after 24f and 35m  He groomed you  End of story  Get out YATA   parenting together is hard to navigate  You both come in with preconceived notations of what is appropriate and no one ever really discusses those before hand  As a result you wind up walking blind through a minefield of each other s expectations   Now could he be better at listening  Yes  But he likely doesn t think he needs to  Your baby is safe and well taken care of  He will always be less sensitive the minutia of parenting because he s a man and was likely raised where a bit more caution was thrown to the wind because kids are very resilient  A skipped meal  or blueberry cheese vs  Regular chex isn t going to be the thing that ruins their life   You on the other hand were likely conditioned to think you bear ultimate responsibility for every gram of sugar and missed meal  That not being hyper vigilant is the same as being neglectful which it absolutely isn t   You need to sit down with Hubby and have this discussion  Not just how you want to parent but why you want to parent the way you want to parent  Unless you re both clear on the why of each other you won t ever give the other any leeway for not doing it your way  That ends in needless conflict  But if you each understand each other s why and reasoning it becomes easier to parent together and seek advice for things you run into along the way  it becomes about finding out  a journey of discovery as opposed to a fight when your ideas clash  And you both need to be flexible in this  compromise breeds trust  breeds good communication   Give yourselves each a bit of leeway as well because you are both learning God your both insane both are assholesNAH   He literally didn t feed her  not once  but twice Neither of you are the A Hole  Our daughter is 20 months and we try not to sweat the little things  Yes  we are very routine  but I solicit instructions from my wife  If your husband wants to do things his own way  live and let live Yeah  just chill out  NTA because you have good intentions but you need to lighten up  Don’t be that mom  that is so controlling dad can’t ever do anything right    It will be fine if he does things a little different and not your way  Let him have some control so he can be a dad Maaaaan I was clueless with my two girls as babies  Not for the lack of trying either  Moms just got it on lock when they’re the ones on maternity leave for the year and have the time to develop the routines and such  Sounds like he loves his child  I honestly think that we’re just a touch more oblivious to these things as we don’t tend to focus on them all day like most moms  Huge generalization I know  But in my circle it’s very true  Go easy on the big fella  He’s trying  You’re also NTA either  Just work on communication and empathy                             Post Title  AITAH for not sharing coffee with coworker content  This is so stupid  I already know  but it’s been days now and I can’t stop feeling guilty    I work in a really small office  there’s four of us here  There was only three of us for a few years  then we got one new person earlier this year  For my whole time working here I’ve been the only one who drinks coffee  so there’s no community coffee pot or anything  I got myself one of those mini coffee pots that holds like four cups and I get my own coffee  filters  all that  and the pot is in my office because there’s never been a reason for it to be in a common area    Our new coworker sometimes drinks coffee  I see her bring in Starbucks or McDonalds sometimes  but I never really thought much of it  Then one day I was saying how I have lately been enjoying coffee in the afternoon as well  which was different for me because usually I switch to water at lunch  She said she also sometimes liked to have coffee in the afternoon as it helps her fight the afternoon slump    The next day after she comes in with a coffee pot and says she’s gonna take it home to clean it  it was thrifted  and will just have to some coffee and stuff and now she can have coffee in the afternoons too  I was like “yay ” and carried on  Then it hit me later  omg  should I have just shared mine with her  Holy crap  duh    So now I’m feeling awful like I should’ve offered to let her use mine and we could share or I could’ve put it in a common area or something  I will say that she’s pretty much the nicest person in the world and I highly  highly doubt she’s upset  but I also know she would never ever ask for coffee  I just feel like such a jerk   especially  because she’s so nice    So  AITAH for not sharing my coffee and coffee pot Comments  NTA  But since you’re feeling guilty the next time you run into her  just tell her “I’m really sorry  I don’t know where my head was  but when you came in to show me the coffee pot the other day  I should’ve offered you some of mine  and I feel really guilty for that oversight“  she’s probably not upset  but this will make you feel better I think you are over thinking this  there s no reason for her to have expected you to give her your coffee  It s just at likely she d seen your set up and thought  yes that s a great idea  I m going to do the same   Sure  you overlooked offering her some of yours that one day when it came up but sheesh that s pretty small in the scheme of things   If you want to  you can always suggest seeing up a kitty between the two of you to buy and share coffee  but if you have different tastes and budgets it might be easier not to   You were NTA but for sure have a quick chat with her if you feel it would ease your mind                             Post Title  AITA for being mad that my sister used my room as a guest room content  So I  23F  and my sister  24F  decided to move into an apartment together to save money on rent  It’s been good so far with a few issues but we never really set boundaries with what we expect from each other    I have side jobs I do on weekends to get extra money  pet sitting  babysitting  etc  and if I have to pet sit I will go out of town and stay at the home for that amount of time     Recently I left to go pet sit and I asked my sister if she could have the place semi clean since we have to leave for a vacation two days after I get home  I work 8 5 and have little time to do things after work  She doesn’t work during the summer and has all the time in the world so I didn’t see an issue with it  She agreed to clean up and that was it    I was aware she was having a friend over while I was gone  who I know and get along with  for the weekend  And I offered for that friend  let’s call her Sarah  to use my room if she didn’t want to stay in my sisters room and she said no worries she would stay with my sister in her room    Fast forward on Sunday her and her friend group went to a water park and I assumed they had left and gone home after  All was well    I go to work Monday after finishing my pet sitting job  running on very little sleep  and decided to stop by the apartment on my lunch break to get food and put my bags up  I come inside and hear the TV on but I’m confused cause it’s coming from my room  mind you there’s a TV in the living room and her room  I walk in and see my sister and her other friend  who I dislike very much let’s call her Maggie  lounging in my bed under the covers  I was instantly upset    I asked my sister why Maggie was in my room and she said “oh she spent the night we had a girls night”  I was taken back cause she never told me someone other than Sarah would be staying here    I respect my sister and her belongings and I don’t use anything without her permission let alone go into her room because I respect her things    I asked her to clean my sheets and put my room back together like she found it cause I cleaned it before I left for my pet sitting job  She said she would and I went back to work    My expectations are always low because she never does what she says she’ll do so she did exactly what I expected and didn’t start washing them till I got off work  I came home and my room was a mess  pillows all on the floor cups on the dresser and my bed just completely empty  I go into my closet and notice my water shoes were in the middle of the closet and I hadn’t used them in a while  I asked her if she used them where she replied “yeah” and I asked again “I thought you used a different pair of your shoes like you told me earlier” then she replied “oh yeah Sarah used them”    I was really upset and went back into my bathroom where I found towels on the floor and hair on the shower wall  it was a black hair and mine is blonde     I’m currently typing this because I feel violated and disrespected that she didn’t even ask me if it was ok and just assumed my room was a guest room  I was fine with Sarah using it because I knew she would clean up  But she didn’t even ask me if Maggie could stay in my room  she knows I don’t like her    AITA for getting upset  I would never do that to my sister without her permission Comments  Personally  I d pull my sister  by the hair  into the room and say  THIS IS NOT OKAY  CLEAN THIS SHIT UP  NOW  Now  if you ll excuse me  I need to go take a shit on your bed    Jokes aside  I just don t understand why so many people in this world nowadays have no understanding of common fucking courtesy   NTATime to get a lock for your door Which part of this story has you thinking you might be the asshole   This is a post for a rant sub where you can bitch about how you were wronged   You know damn well you didn t do anything wrong Sit your sister down and tell her what she did was fucked up and VERY disrespectful towards you and your personal stuff and space and if it happens again you will leave and go no contact  Then get a lock for your room and bathroom and keep them locked I’d also tell your parents so she can’t twist the story in her favorNTA  but you need to put a lock on your door and a webcam in case she breaks the door down NTA   I don’t think your sister deserves access to your apartment anymore Get a lock for your bedroom door and next time she is out invite some grubby dude over to enjoy her bed and belongings lolAgree with others  Lock your room when you leave the apartment and if she doesn t like it  tough shit NTA  the worst part is now you don t know what else may have been used  needs to be cleaned  Your sister probably knows that were she to ask you  you would probably say yes  The problem is she didn t ask  she just took  which isn t ok  It s not hers to take  and it s not fair to you that you can t feel like your things are safe while you aren t home Nta The best decision I ever made was putting a lock on my door to protect me from my abusive brotherNTA Get a lock and always lock it cause if she doesnt care now she will never care and still do it NTA  That was incredibly rude of your sister NTA   She let at least one guest stay in your room and loaned out your water shoes  You have no way of knowing what else she did because she s been hiding her actions from you and only admitting to things if you catch her   Letting someone you don t like sleep in your bed and hang out in your room was a total AH move on her part NTA  your sister is though  she’s taking advantage of you and you need to set some boundaries immediately and get a lock for your door  she lacks the decency to just ask you and to not clean up after herself and her guests is awful  i’d honestly consider changing the living arrangement if she keeps this upNTAH       Put a padlock on your door whenever you leave the apartment     Get a lock

unless you forcibly put a stop to it   Yikes   Your sister sucksUnfortunately  I am assuming that you sister is the baby or the younger sibling of the family  Therefore  she hasn t had the same expectations  You need to sit her down and explain CLEAR expectations  including the fact that your room is NOT a free for all  You have permission to a specific friend  Not any friend  She needs to understand this or have her own space  This is normal in any roommate situation NTA   Get a lock  let her know this was totally unacceptable   No one is ever allowed to use your room  your things  or stay at your home without permission   And you won’t invite others to stay over without her permission  but going forward  since neither she nor her friends can respect your things  no one is allowed in your room ever  including her   Get a lock   And put up a camera in your room facing the door NTA  You gave permission for Sarah to sleep in your bed  not for every random friend of your sister to have free reign  Get a lock for your door  and start looking for somewhere else to livePut a lock on your door and use it NTA buy a lock for your door Get a door knob that uses a real key and always

conversation you’ll have to have a few times  Roommate relationships are complicated  sibling roommates even more so Get a lock  it’ll solve your issue  Set hard boundaries  Your sister should have asked to lend your stuff out before assuming you’d say yes  She had her own room so she could’ve hung out with Maggie in there Move out   saving on rent does not trump being used and abused  Quit

lock for your bedroom doorNTAH  have a calm discussion and set boundaries  Make sure she understands that it is a consequence her actions that you will no longer let her borrow your stuff  If she can’t abide by this then nicely tell her it’s not working and that maybe it’s not a good idea for siblings to live together  Rules when you’re a kid are not the same when you’re an adult  It’s easy for siblings to fall back into old habits and accidentally take advantage of each other  She would probably have been more respectful if it were someone else NTA  Just how clueless is your sister  Treat her like a child  Stand over her telling her what to do as she cleans your room and bathroom  Then add locks Put a lock on your door Get a lock for your bedroom door and lock it every time you leave Gather the trash and dump it in her room along with the dirty towels  Get a lock and a spine  NTANTA   That is YOUR space and YOUR things  All things that you pay for and have a reasonable expectation of privacy over  I think it s time to set a boundary with your sister on that  and following that if she violates it again  putting a lock on your door   Yea I know that sounds a little far  but it will absolutely enforce your boundary       ETA  get a cam in your room too  so that you ll know for sure if your boundary has been violated                             Post Title  I need advice plzzcontent  Comments  can you talk to your siblings about it  i think it depends on the way your parents handle confrontation  do you think if you approached them calm and mature that they would seriously think about it and reflect or would they get defensive What there nothing wrong with having favorites  however  you should treat all your kids equallytell them how you’re feeling  And ask are they trying to get you to make up with your birth mom so they can bow out of being your parents  And FYI they are financially responsible for you until you’re 18 and you can’t be left out of the well should anything happen to them  You weren’t their mistake  no oops baby but a choice they made in adopting you  Hopefully  they will said they are sorry and didn’t realize you were feeling

content  AITA for filling the dogs water bowl up when it was empty   Not too long ago  I  19  was playing a game when my mum’s dog came into my room  He was panting heavily and seemed stressed so I took him downstairs and checked his water bowl  Bone dry  I grabbed the bowl and went to the kitchen to fill it up  I notice a tin of empty dog food so I know he’s been fed already  he just needs water and he’ll settle down for the night  I put the kettle on as well to make a cup of tea  As I was doing this my “brother”  26  walked in and was shuffling around in his stuff  right by the area we keep the food and water bowl    We have a seriously bad relationship so I put the water bowl on the kitchen counter and was taking my tea upstairs  I was going to wait until he left and then put the water bowl where it belongs  As I’m walking out I hear something along the lines of “F cking idiot  feeding my f cking dog  He’s already been f cking fed  Interfering with sh t you don’t even know ” It’s not his dog  my dad bought the dog for my mum but he has deluded himself into thinking the dog belongs to him  He doesn’t feed the dog  doesn’t buy the dog food  doesn’t clean up the dog mess  doesn’t tidy up when the dog pees inside  He just likes the idea of having a “tough guard dog” but he won’t take responsibility for anything the dog needs    I stopped and said “That’s his water bowl”  He storms up and gets in my face shouting about how he doesn’t care about that  no one likes me  the dog doesn’t even like me  he’s going to bite my face off one day  how I sit in my room all day and do nothing with my life  Which is ironic because he’s never had a stable job and smokes weed all day  I worked for a year and the ‘sitting in my room all day’ is the three weeks after I quit my job and was waiting for the move in date at my university  Let me note  he’s never been to university and never will  He’s got no qualifications from school and no job prospects  Him and his girlfriend beg mum and dad for money so he can buy drugs everyday   It wasn’t even worth arguing so I walked off upstairs and he chased me  I tried shutting my door and he smashed it  The door won’t even close properly now and it’s broken  He was in my room  shouting in my face about how he should beat me up  women are good for nothings and just a lot of violent threatening and name calling  He has a history of being physically violent towards us so I threatened to call the police and he finally left  I’ve called them before in the past so he knew I was serious    Maybe I shouldn’t have said anything because he’s mentally unstable and genuinely believes he’s gods gift to the world so he can say and do whatever he wants but I can’t stand having to bite my tongue because of his mentally unstable behaviour  He won’t accept help   Am I the asshole Comments   deleted NTA and GO DO IT CALL THE COPS  Get him AWAY from you and the dog   A55holes like that are always the worst to the people closest  usually just physically closest  to them and if they meet someone who can truly stand up for them  they are usually cowards   or he will end up dead when he gets in the wrong persons face NTA   Barring a fluid restriction  the dog should have water in his bowl  If your brother wants to provide for the dog’s needs and keep his water bowl filled  great  But if you see it empty  there is absolutely nothing wrong with you filling his bowl  Our pets depend on us for those basic needs    Your brother had a disproportionate response to the situation and sounds quite volatile per your report  NTA  and hoping you stay safe Oh man I feel this on a crazy level  My crazy brother got rough with my pups a few weeks ago and wouldn t stop calling one of them the n word  she has black fur  so I called him out for his racism and told him to leave the dogs alone and shut his mouth and he immediately threw aside the table that was between us and attacked me  He s stabbed me in the past so I immediately called 911  His fool ass ran out of here like the coward he is  Crazy siblings club for sure  🥹😅  Crazy thing is for most of my life I ve been told I m the screwup between the two of us even though he s violent  a bigot  etc What do you parents say and do about this behaviour  Are they accepting of a situation where their son is behaving this way to their daughter    Of course you are NTA but I think you may need to get out and move elsewhere  If your mum   parents aren t able or willing to resolve this  you ll need to do so yourself and get yourself out    I m sorry you re dealing with this Why does your mom öet him live there when he is violent towards the rest of thd damily   Your sister is younger  I think  Your mom should be protecting her  And the dog r Amitheangel call the police  record his outbursts  buy maceTBH  it s tough dealing with a drug addict  As much as you want to help  it s best to focus on your own life  They re good at blaming others and manipulating situations  Unfortunately  it could get worse  but remember it s not your fault  Put your energy into your future  maybe studying  Let go of any anger  it s not helping  You can t fix them  they have to want to change You are NTA  You’re a victim                             Post Title  AITAH for having sex with a friend who was in a relationship with another woman content  This happened december of 2022  so ages will be adjusted to what they were then    I  op   16F  had sex with  Logan   17M   Logan had a girlfriend  Sally   17F    names are fake   Background  idk if any of this info is relevant but I ll say it anyways   I used to be homeschooled  I started public school my freshman year of highschool  2020 21  online because of covid   I had been in a relationship once before  not with Logan   in 2020  We did do handsy stuff in that relationship  but never had sex    Logan and I had been good friends for a while  because we had been in the same German class at school for two years in a row  I started liking him the end of my sophomore year  but knew it would never happen because he had a girlfriend    Sally went to a different school than Logan and I  so I didn t know her very well    Fast forward to december 2022  I was in my junior year and Logan was a senior  He sent me a text asking if I wanted to go watch the United World Wrestling freestyle world cup  He told me that his mother won two tickets at her workplace  and she didn t want to go  I asked Logan why he didn t invite Sally  and he said it was because she didn t like loud noises   I also don t like loud noises  so I understand that  I don t understand why he asked me to go because he knew I didn t like loud noises either    I said that I would like to go with him  Tbh  this was my first time hanging out with friends outside of school without parents around  so I was pretty excited    When getting ready to go  I remember choosing pants that were easy to come off  I don t know why I did that  I think I was hoping that he would tell me that he d break up with his girlfriend for me and we would have sex    Only one of those things happened    He picked me up in his car and drove ~30 minutes to the venue  We watched wrestling  We started getting really close and he kissed me  We made out  I started getting uncomfortable with the fact that we were making out and there were children sitting behind us  I asked if we could go back to his car  We did  He asked me front seat or back  I said back  We made out and then had sex  with protection   He didn t come    Afterwards  I asked Logan what he was going to tell his girlfriend  He said he wouldn t tell her  but he agreed to after I pushed it    He never told her    Sally found out about him and I going together  because I made an instagram post with a selfie of Logan and I  Sally messaged me asking about it  Sally told me that Logan said that he went to the wrestling thing with his handicapped grandmother  I told Sally about Logan and I having sex  She was furious with him  They broke up shortly after    Then a lot of things happened  and Sally and I thought about dating  She eventually cut things off because I reminded her too much of Logan    I left a lot of details out for the sake of brevity  so if any questions needs to be answered I am open to it  I made this post because even though it feels like what I did might have been wrong  no one irl has said that to me   Edit  I am starting to regret having posted this without keeping all the details in    For starters  I didn t do anything with bad intentions in mind  Yes  I was only thinking of myself and it was selfish  but I didn t do anything for nefarious reasons   Second  Sally and I became really good friends after this happened  and she told me that he had treated her terribly and disrespected her boundaries  so she didn t miss him   Last  even though this is hard to type  I want to say thank you to the people who have been responding and being honest  I didn t think what I had done was so bad  but I now realize how much I need to grow before I am ready for a relationship again Comments  ESH   You for enabling a cheater and him for being the cheater   I feel like this must be a joke post because this shouldn t be difficult to figure out   Sally is the only one that didn t do anything wrong YTA  obviously  and you know exactly why   It was good of you to come clean to Sally though   She deserved to know the truth about people she thought cared about her You are far too immature to be having sex with anyone  You need someone to show you how a man should be treating you  Front seat or back seat  isn t it  You re supposed to date and get to know each other BEFORE you have sex  Relationships get built slowly  It s about communicating and learning to trust each other  You allowed a guy who s in a relationship with someone else to use you for sex  Then you destroyed that relationship   Do you have any idea of the pain you caused her  Do you know what you did to her self esteem  Until you can answer those two questions honestly to yourself   you need to stop having sex  You re far too immature to be engaging in that activity   Has anyone ever explained std s to you  You know herpes and hiv are forever   Condoms break  what then  You really should be talking to a counselor   This is the behavior of someone with low or no self respect for themselves   You need to find out why you don t respect yourself  A councilor will help you with that ESH sounds like you had a mission and you accomplished it  Also sounds like you wanted him to tell her out of spite instead if guilt You re 16  don t ruin your future over some loser  You re only young once  don t waste it  You should be thinking about prom and starting to look at college  An education can never be taken away from you  Part of having confidence is the knowledge that you will always be able to support yourself   When you know your own self worth  you ll pick a quality partner  Get out there and enjoy these years  you ll never have them again   You re going to be an adult very soon  Deal with relationships and sex later  Enjoy your youth while you can  Do you really want to be stressing about sex and relationships at 16  Those are adult issues  and you re not there yet  Go have fun ESH  You know he was in a relationship  you knew he would be cheating  and you wanted him to cheat or breakup with his GF   You totally had bad intentions                             Post Title  AITA for accidentally leading a guy on  TW  Teenage shit you may not care aboutcontent  Hello  I  F16  rejected my  M16  friend  I feel awful and some of my friends have even said I’ve led him on  Starting to think they re right         Context  I’ll call  M16  Mark  Mark is one of those guys who you become kinda friends with because he’s always sitting by your actual friends and when you go talk to them he’s right there  Last year we had a class where it was just us two sat at a table meant for 4 the whole year  I’m a huge sports fan   basketball  Football  and Soccer to be exact  and it was easy for us to go into discussions about these sports  I thought he was cool because he agreed to watch the World Cup with me  I begged him to put his computer next to mine to watch both of the final group stage games at once  All we really did was talk mess about the other s favorite team players and things like that  We only spoke to each other when we were right in front of each other and he started sitting by my friends at lunch  which I didn’t mind because I saw him as their friend         Where I think fault began to fall on me  As homecoming approached he kept talking about this girl he was gonna ask out for it and asked me for advice  I told him to be himself and all that jazz BOOM two days later he was in the mfing cafeteria holding a sign in my face with 4 of his friends recording my every move  it was so loud  Our entire grade level has the same lunch  I looked in his eyes and asked  “As friends right ” and he said “Sure” and nodded really fast  In my mind  I went  Cool ok then  agreeing  Me saying yes to that seemed to flip some kinda switch in him and before I knew it he was oddly conscious of my feelings and things I like  no more jokingly making fun of me or the teams I like  he started bringing extra food and drinks to school  always offering me some  and he asked me to go to amusement parks  soccer games  and even his track meets  I always said no because I m a hermit and our local soccer team is dogshit  I still thought these were friendly invites and that s on me for not reading between the lines  He never verbalized that he liked me or was interested in me romantically but looking back I never verbalized that I wasn t into him so maybe that s why he got the wrong idea         Anyway here s where the real drama is  Fast forward to this year  he runs for class pres and wins  At our grade level meeting where they announced the winner  he thanked all of his friends and his girlfriend  my name  for voting for him  People kept asking me if that was true and I would embarrassingly correct them  I met up with him after and asked why he would say that he was outwardly confused and thought we were dating  He asked me what he was doing all that stuff for if we weren t dating  I assume  stuff  meant being nice to me but whatever  All my friends have told me that he was obviously into me  Some are saying I led him on and others are saying otherwise but they all agree that he clearly wanted to date me  Others who barely knew me around school thought we were already dating even before that event  Originally I was firm in my belief that I did nothing wrong but as more and more people tell me I did him dirty I just don t know anymore  Am I the asshole that led him on         Tldr  I thought a guy friend was platonically asking me to homecoming because that s what we agreed  but he thought otherwise  He invited me to multiple events  amusement parks and sports events  that I never went to  He assumed we were dating and announced our  relationship  in front of our entire grade  I confronted him and he didn t react well  everyone but me could tell he liked me  with some thinking we were already dating   AITA for not noticing his feelings earlier          Sorry for any spelling Grammar mistakes Comments  I didn’t read all this but I appreciate the TW  Good luck   NTA   You don t need to feel guilty for rejecting somebody    You re entitled to not date people you don t want to date  and saying no to somebody isn t doing wrong by them “as friends right” anyway here’s my girlfriend     wth   ntaLook  this guy publicly asked you out without knowing the answer in advance and that’s just unfair behavior and disqualifying right there  Then he said tried to further apply public pressure for you to date him when he lied about your relationship   People can interpret nearly anything as hopeful through the powerful distortion lens of infatuation  you’re not responsible for that   NTA  Marks full of entitlement  manipulative  and not emotionally mature enough to be dating anyone NTA  You did nothing wrong  This boy tried to trick you into a relationship NTA  You corrected him when he obviously overstepped boundaries and told him you were just friends  He pushed his feelings onto you and thought that the kindness would in debt you to him or that you’d eventually return feelings  That kind of behavior is a slow creep push of normal seeming behavior that feels unpleasant uneasy and he is a creep NTA  you’re going to come across this a lot unfortunately  Some guys just assume they can have you  Without even asking  He decided in his head that you were his girlfriend even after you clarified the dance ask “as friends ”  FRIENDS I lean towards NTA because you specified  as friends  and he still assumed that it was more  Where I think fault began to fall on me  As homecoming approached he kept talking about this girl he was gonna ask out for it and asked me for advice  I told him to be himself and all that jazz BOOM two days later he was in the mfing cafeteria holding a sign in my face with 4 of his friends recording my every move  it was so loud  Our entire grade level has the same lunch  I looked in his eyes and asked  “As friends right ” and he said “Sure” and nodded really fast  In my mind  I went  Cool ok then  agreeing   NTA because you re 16  and this is where you learn   He needs to communicate better  and clearly has a problem   You needed to communicate you didn t want to date him  and instead you said  as a friend    That s not clear communication  when what you want to communicate is  I do not want to date you    Something like that is what you need to tell him  not kind of hint and hope it comes across  So oops   You kind of did lead him on  but also clearly the two of you don t know how to talk to each other  and yeah  that s never going to work   Seriously  he basically didn t talk to you long enough to figure out if you two were dating or not and announced it in front of the class   Hey   16 once   You get to make these kind of mistakes at this age  so does he  Apologize to him  he does deserve an apology   Not any more than that   Also you deserve an apology because he made you uncomfortable with that announcement   Even if you were dating  you might not be comfortable with it being announced like that  he should have checked with you     Just basically a learning experience for both of you NTANTA  i would expect an ACTUAL question or statement where he asked you or told you that he wanted to be in a relationship with you  so the lack of communication on his part is giving  too young to date because i won t even bother asking this person out on a proper date that is OUTSIDE of school grounds  sorry if that sounds rude  but you really just didn t do anything wrong imoNTA  you said you were going as friends  and you didn t go on any dates without that warning  so you re good                             Post Title  WIBTA for ending a 7 year long friendship content  I  X23  have been best friends with F23 since we were 16  For the story  let s call her Jessie    Jessie and I went to high school together where we got really close  We ve since moved to different places for university  We ve remained close and frequently referred to each other as soulmates    A couple of years ago  Jessie came into money problems and I  being her best friend of 5 ish years at the time offered to help her with around $500 almost every month for a defined time period until she could get back on her feet financially  At first  she was reluctant  but then accepted my offer  However  after that time was over  she kept asking for money  She d ask for everything from $20 to $500 every now and again  Eventually  I sat her down and told her I couldn t afford to spend that kind of money and also told her that I couldn t afford to keep paying for everything whenever we d do things together either  That ended with her telling me a sob story about her trauma    I had always paid for the small things  A cup of coffee here  a pizza there  One time I racked up a $300 bar tab paying for our drinks and snacks for a night out  It sometimes seemed to me that she didn t notice that I always did these things whenever we hung out  In the beginning  I was always happy to do these things  but the prices for what s expected have slowly gone up    Last summer she called me one night telling me she d locked herself out of her apartment  She asked if I could come to pick her up  I didn t have access to a car that night so I said that wouldn t be possible  She has other friends in the area  but she had lied to those friends and told them she was living with her parents so they wouldn t come over  I tried everything under the fucking sun  She could tell them her family was on vacation  Nope  she didn t like that idea  She could call the guy she was seeing  Nope  He didn t have a car  neither did I   The whole thing ended with me ordering her  and paying for  a taxi so that she could go to his place    I d saved up a bit of money to travel later that summer  I landed hoping for a stress free holiday  turned off flight mode and the first thing I saw was a message from her asking for money  I caved  Both of these events were after I told her I couldn t afford to keep sending her money    There was more than just money to it   She d frequently call me to tell me about how her group of friends at home turned out to be awful people  In the almost 5 years since I moved away  she s not maintained any other friend than me  Every time I d keep telling her that yeah  those things those people did was awful  I gave advice until my tongue gave out and she d still end up in those friendships all over again  I later realized that she was my only source of information in these conflicts and that  seeing as the only common denominator was her  she may have been more guilty in those friendships failing than I may have thought  She d position us as sort of a  us against the world  thing  where there d constantly be something wrong with everyone else  I would indulge her  Socially her world has more recently started being about romance  And she d often call me to talk for hours on end about these boys and the drama that ensued after the situationships were over  I d frequently tell her that none of this is up my alley and that I didn t understand her drama  I always thought the whole situation was childish    She s made a routine of calling me up the night before her exams and telling me that she s sure she ll fail  At first  I tried my very best to make a rigid system that she had to follow  homework and readings and so on   It always seemed to me like she thought her education was so much more difficult than everyone else s  and she d often complain about things that were perfectly normal for all university students as if I would go  nooo  omg  that s so tough   At first  I tried the sympathy road  but then it kept going and I had to put my foot down    She s had such difficulty with getting her academic record straight that at one point I wrote an at home exam for her  I have an A in a class I did not take  My education is not similar to hers  but this was just a subject I sorta knew from experience and got an A in  It s her only A  I cannot remember if I offered to write it  or if she asked me to    This barely scratches the surface  but I think you get the gist    So  this is where the whole I may be the asshole thing comes in to play  I ve recently told her to get a therapist before she talks to me again  That I feel is a fair call  However  I ve always indulged the behavior or been some form of a catalyst to it  I offered to lend her money first  I offered to help her with things  I started the conversation around dropping friends you don t enjoy  I indulged her  I said it was fine to lie to her friends so that she could protect her peace at home  I created all this shit    Would I be the asshold for ending a friendship because of behavior I have indulged in the past Comments  Absolutely not  She sounds like a very toxic person based on what you’ve said about her  I usually try to give benefit of the doubt  but she’s destroyed that already  I’m so sorry  I don’t really have good advice other than answering your question  You deserve peace and she’s not allowing that You’re allowed to drop people if they aren’t good to you  She sounds terribleNTA  this friendship sounds completely one sided   It doesn t make you an asshole to end it   Maybe if she gets help with a therapist you can renew your friendship in the future   But you are allowed to focus on yourself and your financial and mental well being   She is an adult and can take care of herself   Frankly this sounds much more like the relationship of an indulgent parent to a spoiled child than two adults     It s possible to feel conflicted about ending a friendship that has lasted for many years  especially when you have been a support system for the other person  However  it s important to prioritize your own well being and boundaries  If you feel that the friendship has become toxic and is negatively impacting your life  it is time to reassess the relationship  You don t need to feel guilty for ending a friendship that no longer serves you or your mental health  You can communicate your decision and reasons to the other person in a respectful manner and wish them well in their future endeavors NTAH  She’s straight up using you  End it before she puts you in the poor house NTA but you are the AH to yourself for being an enabler and a doormat  You owe this colossal waste of time and money absolutely nothing Being raised in a traumatic environment  and never learning coping skills  sets you up for a really difficult young adulthood  She likely wasn’t taught anything about daily living  managing money  keeping on top of schoolwork  etc  because life was whatever flavor of dysfunctional it was  It’s really hard  You don’t know what is and isn’t normal because  that was your normal   You’re needy  and ask things about other people that are wildly out of phase with what is realistic  You’re codependent  I’ve been there  It sucks   But here’s the thing  at some point everyone has a choice to realize they have dysfunction and learn and grow  or to stay stagnant  There’s almost no way to not be confronted by that reality  Doing the first thing takes work  It almost always takes therapy  You have to gain a footing that everyone else gained in childhood and it’s scary because you might fail  Your friend  unfortunately  has chosen the other path   As a friend it’s really hard to come to come to a point where you have to accept that your friend is never going to choose to learn and grow  I’ve had those friends too  I feel a ton of empathy for them  You have given her an enormous amount of support through the years  You’ve been the best friend she could have had  But at this point you aren’t  in truth  being a good friend by supporting her dysfunction  The best thing you can do is make her stand on her own two feet                             Post Title  WIBTAH for charging my mother $50 or more in exchange for cleaning off the coffee table content  Around the time of it s release  I begged my mother to let me purchase the ARK  Survival Evolved remake that was on sale with all the DLC being for free  around $500 value for the price of $50  in exchange for cleaning the coffee table that was completely covered in mail and random junk along with around ten 2L coke bottles under the table   The thing is that it s now a literal fucking hill of papers filled to the brim with roaches along with all kinds of plastic cups filled with the bodies dead roaches floating around inside  I ll be wearing gloves and a mask of course  but that still doesn t make it any less disgusting to manage   I definitely feel like charging more because of how insanely disgusting it has become  but it s my understanding that my parents might not be able to afford anything higher than that    I m only keeping it at $50 for now because I understand that my parents can t really afford anything higher than that at a time  otherwise I d gladly bump it up to at least $75 or even $100 just for having to deal with all the roach feces and rotten trash   I m slowly getting better at learning to save money just for the sake of having it in the bank  There are still 2 items I want  which are the vaulted Pumpkin Kitty from Build A Bear and a 3 pack of Squirkies fidget pets to hold me down until Christmas where I can put the glow in the dark 5 pack on a wishlist    However  my expectations of receiving the five pack are incredibly low due to my entire family seething over the fact that I still collect toys as an adult and usually criticize my spending habits as such   As much as I love video games  I m currently in a deep depressive state and have plenty of progress I need to catch up on between all of them  The only two games that I really  truly want right now is G Force for the Wii and the new Nintendogs   Cats game for the 3DS   The library of Switch games I have are pretty decent for its incredibly small size  but it s big enough for me  I truly do love ARK  but I get bored because the screen on the Switch Lite is too small and I have little interest in any of them until I can get a regular Switch console to where it will also play on the TV   The only reason I m spending money on toys and such is because all my needs are being met at the facility I m staying at and there isn t really anything else to do in a small town with no friends in sight   The facility also gives us $60 out of our disability checks each month  but their local bank isn t open on the weekends and it s way too much just to walk up to all these other banks  not to mention setting up an account and everything   The only way to deposit my monthly funds is by leaving it all at my parents for them to take to the bank  but I don t really trust them to look after it all that much   I ve tried to get welfare involved but my mother has gotten to where she practically drinks herself to sleep on top of 15 years of lithium as a bipolar med and smoking weed  My hoarder father is in so much pain that all he can ever do anymore is play on his phone and that s it   I d love to get a job and make my own money  but I struggle just to go to sleep at night and get out of bed for therapy 3 days a week due to all the nightmares  The only reason I m in a facility is because my parents  housing situation has gone to complete shit and all my highschool friends have to drive move out of state to go to work each day because of how insanely horrifying the local job market is   The only thing stopping me from getting an apartment outside of rent is all the deadbeat meth heads that would try to beat on my windows in the middle of the night on top of bedbugs and even more roaches   No amount of money in the world will change my parent s behavior  but it s nice to have some in my account knowing that I ll be stuck with useless designer church girl garbage for Christmas instead of anything remotely interesting or useful like I have for the past two decades   I know it doesn t seem to be all that ethical  but my parents are beyond any kind of help at this point and I m a bit desperate to have online funds in case I find a special something on sale and just for the sake of saving it   Another reason I might be the asshole is because we eat Chinese every weekend because the food at the facility I m staying at tastes like shit and is hard on my stomach   Most of the meals there are so incredibly bad that I m burnt out on anything that isn t McDonald s or Wendy s  but my mother says it hurts her stomach somehow  probably due to all the roaches at her house   As someone who eats raw Spaghettios and had to eat McChickens small fries for an entire year straight because that s all we could afford  that s really saying something   It s gotten so much worse due to their health problems and we barely afford to get out of the house as it is  What little groceries we do manage to scrounge up goes to complete ruin as soon as it enters the house   If it weren t for her place being such a filthy environment where all the food is caked in roaches and gnats  I wouldn t be eating out anywhere near as much nor charging such a big sum of money over a single coffee table   What should I do Comments  Well   this was a read for sure    You should really come up with some sort of plan to move out from your parent s place  I don t know how old you are but you seem young  Well written   articulate but you ve been living this life that your parents have normalized  but it definitely isn t normal  so it seems you ve been desensitized to things you shouldn t be  Roaches  Those things might follow you around for the rest of your life  I don t know how long you ve been dealing with those but just know if you see 1 roach  you ve definitely got thousands in the walls  This is not normal  Also fast food and crap for every meal  Does no one ever cook at all in your family  You re stomach probably hates you because of this  Idk it just seems like a terrible environment to live and I would definitely consider your parents as shitty parents  sorry    To answer your question  don t worry about it  Enjoy your game                             Post Title  Do I deserve this   28 F  28 M content   Do I deserve this   Timeline to this wild ride  I  28 F now  was in a relationship with Jed  28 M now  for 5 years  He was a bartender and we allowed flirting but nothing more in our relationship  He did for work and I’m just kind of a flirty person without meaning to be  When I was younger I had very low self esteem and male attention made me feel better  Not great but not uncommon  It’s something that I’ve grown up a lot and away from  We started dating when we were 19  A lot changed by the time we were 26  Jed became an alcoholic and had erectile dysfunction  I suffer from pretty bad depression  I can be really negative and talk about my feelings too much  I think very deeply about the world and philosophy  I’m not everyone’s cup of tea  We stop having sex and he stop even attempting to get me off  But I still loved him and just thought we hit a rough patch  He got a job out of state and that was the nail in the coffin   A month before my break with Jed I reconnected with an old friend from high school while I was visiting my parent  his name Lee  28 M Lee was getting his life together   He had a failed entertainment career and just gotten out of a long relationship  but had been sober for two years  We talk about philosophy  sobriety  mysteries of life  It’s great I never get to talk to anyone about this stuff  He was now living with his parents in our home city  We really hit it off as friends  He wants to come visit me in my state   Jed and I break up when he takes the job in another state  Lee had already planned his trip to visit me  We have a blast and I took him backpacking for the first time  We ended up hooking up  I told him I really liked him but he said he had other plans to go join this cult  He’s been interested in spirituality since getting sober  Red flag but I’m empathetic   Lee and I keep talking on the phone  Me and our other friend convince him not to join the cult   I start seeing my friend Jake  28 M  casually  I’m exploring things after the end of my long relationship  Neither of us are interested in each other in a serious way    Lee calls me randomly and tells me loves me and he wants to come to live with me in my state  I’m overwhelmed by this  I’m also just starting to see someone else because I thought he was going to join a cult   Then my mom starts dying  What a wild ride already   I return home for a few months while my mom was quickly dying from cancer and I really connect with Lee  He was very kind and there for me  I really like him but he just seemed so lost    After my mom died I return to the state I live and start drinking heavily  Lee judges me harshly for this  However I am meeting a lot of people and surrounding myself with friends  People grieve differently  I’m starting to be confused about what I want with Lee  I love him and could spending the rest of my life with him but felt pressured into a relationship too quickly and he’s kind of a dead weight with no degree or career  I feel guilty for feeling this way  Our sex life is okay  I really like him though and I try look past it  Jake had given me my first orgasm in my life  I feel guilty  I don’t why I can’t orgasm with Lee  I feel horrible  I don’t want to talk to Lee about it because I don’t want hurt his feelings   Here’s where I might be the asshole  I’m on molly at an event and Jake kissed me and I kissed back  I feel awful  There is no excuse for that  I tell Lee immediately and he’s heartbroken  He want to work it out but I tell him that I want to get my shit together  Lee asks if we could friends and to just keep talking to him  but he doesn’t want to hear about any boys  Lee moves to another state and goes to back to school   I start going to therapy  quit drinking heavily  Quit my shitty job that I hated  Get an awesome new job  I climbed Kilimanjaro   Started Hanging out with different people  I still made some bad decisions   Jake and I still hook up cause I’m single and I don’t owe anyone anything  I realize that’s a huge jerk but that’s perfect for a casual hookup and I learn what I like sexually    Until my IUDs fails  I end up pregnant  Jake pressures me into an abortion and abandons me at the clinic  He was a jerk but I didn’t expect that level of sociopathy  The abortion was very traumatic  I start to think I’ve been cursed   I continue my therapy  but the depression is coming back    I go celibate after the abortion   Lee and I still talk  He since converted to Christianity  Lutheran  Which I’m happy for him but I’m an atheist  I was a little resistant at first to his conversion  We start talking more and more  He tells me it’s fine that I’m an atheist   I have an opportunity to visit the city he goes to college in  We reconnect  He tells me he still loves me and always did  He does tell me he wants to join the clergy  I hesitate  I told him about everything that happened the year we were apart  He’s very supportive and understanding   He told me he hadn’t been with anyone else   This turned out to be a lie   We haven’t a few great months before this comes out   He found out through a mutual friend that I was seeing other people  He said he only hooked up with one person  and he only did it because he didn’t want to be resentful if we got back together  was trying to get over me   I forgive him for lying    Another couple months go by  Things are good  We talk about marriage   I had my therapist die and then my best friend die in the same two weeks  How much can someone loose   When I reach to him  I tell him about my grief  He hits me with   He never forgave me for continuing to sleep with Jake   He accuses me of leading him on and using him for emotional support in the year we apart  He doesn’t want to “feel like my therapist” he then sites my relationship with Jed and the flirting that was established and implied I’m a whore  Caused me of using him as emotional support when my mom died  I didn’t flirt with anyone else while we were dating he established that  I’ve done a lot of work on my self esteem and not needing attention from men  But he held the past against me     I felt ripped out that ground from under neither me    He dumps me  Do I deserve to get dumped  Don’t get me know there were many incompatibilities  I not perfect I made some bad decisions but tried to learn from them  But am I the jerk in this situation  I feel like a horrible person Comments  you went through a lot in a very short amount of time  and every handles their grief differently    but i don’t think you really handled your relationship with Lee well  it does sound like you were relying on him for emotional support while you went out and lived your life  YTA but Lee also said things he shouldn’t have  he is not innocent in this situation but you don’t really seem suited for each other anyway    this is a life lesson  people will be affected by your actions So I have had a mess like this in my life before not to the extent of being abandoned at an abortion clinic  I m surprised it didn t happen though   Back and forth relationships sometimes go nowhere  And this is one of those instances  Not that you led him on  I just think you both wanted different things throughout this whole ordeal  And that s perfectly fine  He can t get mad at you for things you did when you two weren t together  And honestly  he can t use it against you either because you two were never in a committed relationship  He can be disgusted by it all he wants but he can t use it as a weapon Big YTA  you used Lee and Jake both  God forbid men stand up for themselves  I pray for the guy who gets stuck with you  Go get therapy from an actual professional because the past one clearly failed                             Post Title  WIBTA if I  M35  ghosted my online girlfriend  F29  who I just met for the first time because of superficial  objective  ratings from friends content  I m sort of drunk and will probably ramble  Sorry for length  I feel like a dick but think this is maybe the best case scenario for everyone   I met  Kylie  playing an MMO online during the pandemic  We bonded over both being late bloomers    I ve never dated seriously because I ve been focusing on finishing an MSc and starting a PhD  I ve been self conscious for awhile that my longest relationship lasted like four months when I was 19  Just flings casual since   Kylie did distance homeschool in high school due to severe bullying in middle school  Then she did a distance program for college and is just a caregiver for her grandma right now  so her social circle is nil and she s never felt confident enough to put herself out there  I thought this was more special than weird  like I found a unicorn  a woman in my age bracket that hasn t dated properly either  but maybe I wasn t thinking it fully through   Anyway  we grew close over the last three years  We d voice chat while playing  sort of be flirty over text sometimes  We did exchange pictures  and while she was obviously not super model hot  nor am I    I thought she had a kind of a nerdy gamer girl next door appeal   Yes  we should have video chatted  I feel stupid    I d be lying if I said I wasn t hoping I d found  the one   She s been ridicullously supportive of my studies  even mailing me care packages during exams  stressful times at the lab  ect   she s from Canada  I grew up in Houston but live in the UK     Fast forward to this month  where she finally received respite care for her grandma for two weeks and wanted to go on a trip  We were both excited about the possility of her coming here for a meet up    She s been AGAIN saintly about it  Reminding me that it ll be ok if we don t click like  that   she s also happy to be a solo tourist here instead  never wants to make me uncomfortable so if at any time I change my mind about a plan we make or something  honor those feelings  ect  From bullying  I think she s just so self aware of trying to make other people not feel forced to be around her if they don t want to be because no one ever  liked her    red flag     I met her at the airport yesterday and I was so nervous about making a good first impression  that I just didn t  see  her properly  if that makes sense  Like how it doesn t matter if your interviewer is a jowly bald old man in sweatpants  you still put on a suit and are anxious about your own appearance moreso  All I know is that she wasn t a catfish and didn t run away screaming from my ugly mug  so I felt it was a win   Anyway  she gave me a gift from Canada  like maple candies and a book from an author in her hometown that writes in my field of study  which made me feel like a huge asshole for not bringing her anything  so I was even more anxious about coming off wrong  I helped her get to her hotel  and we went to a museum  and then we met up with my friend group for drinks and supper because they all really wanted to meet my  online girlfriend of three years    I want to mention that at the museum  Kylie was great to be around  She was funny  making fun of herself for not knowing certain things  interested in learning about the exhibits  kept the conversation going when I didn t know what to say  and OVER THE TOP NICE  Like  this woman cupped a moth in her hands to bring it back outside nice  She somehow got to talking to an employee about how he was a political refugee missing his family trapped in his home country  and she fucking gave this 50 year old man a hug  from his daughters   made him cry  and said that she knew he d be giving his family a tour there someday very soon   But at dinner with my friends  absolutely no one clicked with her  It was awkward as hell  She got quiet in the group setting  which she said she does but still I thought she might try to be more gregarious to make a good impression with them  My friends were giving me looks  rolling their eyes behind her back  I felt like I was put in the middle between a  stranger  and people who I see every day  so I was trying to placate them moreso and ended the night early without going to the second pub   Today  I told Kylie that it would be better if she explored the city on her own because I wasn t feeling well  She again made me feel like shit by being super concerned nice and asking if I needed her to get me anything  like meds or food  but just was 100% supportive and said she d share pictures of her adventures today  She also apologised for being quiet with my friends  and that she s not great with crowds  but she enjoyed meeting everyone   The truth is that for the rest of the night after we split from my friends  my friend group chat  I will say  mostly terminally in school men aged 20s late 30s working in a 100% male dominated academic lab  completely roasted Kylie and said I am undervaluing myself by that being my potential  the one   They took pictures from her social media and compared them to this  objective female attractiveness chart  from a Reddit sub and  proved  to me that she s objectively a 2 10  and then  proved  to me that based on my pictures  I m a 5 5 and need to go for someone more in my league   Before anyone says it  yes  I tried to defend her by talking up how weirdly nice she was is  how supportive of my studies  she s not that bad looking  ect  but it was just everyone agreeing that  bro you re going to have a PhD and she is very low value   I do see what they mean in that she looks the most like women in the 2 2 5 category of that chart  and I don t look like the men in the 2 2 5 chart   It did make me reflect more on her appearance  which is more middle agey than cute gamer girl  I m trying to be delicate here   she has a very large chest that   sags  So she looks bigger around the middle  And she s also very tall  almost 6 foot  with a bit of  gamer shoulders   and doesn t wear makeup or dress up  so not like someone the lads would fist bump you over landing  When you imagine the word  girlfriend   you see   not her  I still thought she was cute in a  woman from the office  way  but I don t know   So I ve been reflecting and like  would it be the lesser asshole move to just do what she said was okay  ghost her and let her be a tourist on her trip and work on starting to date someone more in line with my own appearance  Is it the fucking vainest shit in the world to drop someone for your friend s telling you you can do better   I talked to my sister  who told me that I m being a dumbass because very soon I ll be a 40  balding middle aged man  and then an old man  and looks don t matter anymore at that point  She said  is our grandmother not a  hottie  with her wrinkly neck and arthritic shoe supports and so my beer belly grandfather with no teeth should drop her  That s not what  love  is   But how could I get over everyone in my immediate circle  10  guys who I see every day  slagging me over my girl  They even started calling her  Kyle  and said I should double check she wasn t born a man because of her height and big nose  I m just too socially awkward to fight them over it   I would miss our gaming sessions and her care packages and how she lets me vent about work school  but that s me being into what she is from a distance   Anyway  would I be the asshole if I ghosted her here  which she said was okay before she left    let her have fun on her trip  and just signed up for Tinder instead  or am I losing out on what  true love  is  Comments  YTA  If those are your friends  YTA   If you even consider it  YTA   Speaking as someone who already has a PhD  it ain’t shit  and your friends ain’t shit Wow  your friends are horrible and you’re an idiot  You like this girl but you’re so gullible that a bunch of moronic  immature comments about a person they’ve never met in their lives are actually making you consider ghosting a girl you’ve “dated” for three years  who actually travelled to meet you   Man  yeah  drop her  She has time to meet a good guy down the line  poor girl  And your sister is spot on  you’re so concerned about finding someone more attractive you’re not seeing her as a person  more like an object you’re trying to upgrade because some ridiculous people told you she’s not pretty enough for your ass  Let them keep you warm at night when she’s with someone better and you’re all alone  deleted This has got to be fake  If not  YTA  you don t deserve this girl I get it  If you want someone better looking  go for it  I don t think there s anything wrong with that  Looks are very important to some people  and I don t think anyone should be shamed for that  NTA for that   But damn your friends are scumbags and that you associate with them reflects very poorly on you  It s also weird because this  rating chart  shit comes across as extremely childish  something fifteen year olds to early twenties guys bond over while talking about how much smarter they are are compared to women  and you re a 35 year old man  You re going to be 40 in five years and the friends you hang out with are all emotionally immature or stunted    Is this a big bang theory episode She sounds lovely  your friends sound like real assholes  and they are rubbing of on you  Why are you that insecure about a potential partner that you are basing your opinion on what your AH friends say    Honestly  the way you described her appearance makes me feel bad for her  The way your  friends  talk about makes me feel bad for her   Also  it doesn t sound like she said   Feel free to ghost me if you don t like what I look like   It seem like she said that  if you guys don t click and things felt awkward  she would be fine with continuing the trip on her on  That is different from ghosting her Sounds like you should ghost those friends instead and spend more time with someone who is actually a nice person  I bet none of your mates are shagging 10s  most are probably completely single and have trouble dating  Take that as a hint that you shouldn t be taking dating advice from them  Finish your PhD and then move to Canada to be with this girl and leave those Aholes  I m not even sure you deserve her since it sounds like you fit right in with them Please let this girl go and find someone who deserves her   You are the dictionary definition of a loser and I don’t say that lightly   I’ve never seen someone throw potential happiness away like this   How can someone be so obtuse and delusional to think a PhD makes them hot shit and be so weak willed that they’re so easily influenced by their friends   You may be 35  but you have the emotional maturity of a 16 year old boy   You say you live in the U K   Please use the NHS to get therapy or enquire if your college offers therapy   I say this sincerely so that you don’t sabotage the next relationship opportunity  if another girl comes along and that’s a big if   Seriously  with friends like yours who needs enemies   Do not settle for this girl  she is out of your league emotionally     Do you mind me asking if you’re Asian origin   I’m Asian origin and I’m getting those vibes  but my Asian meter has been off lately   Edited YTA  Spend real time with this lady and see how you do together  If you think she’s cute  that’s enough If you go by who your friends like your going to end up alone and by the sounds of it she can do betterYTA  You are shit and have attracted shit friends in turn  Please cut amazing Kylie loose so she can do better and you can die alone with your circle jerk of losers Bro  if you are 35 and this is like your first rela gf youve had and is  one you met while gaming then you are not a 5 even if you are not that ugly  If she is so ugly that you cant get it up while fucking her then yes  break up  But I feel you are letting your friends change your mind and they are actually disrespecting you by disrespecting YOUR girlfriend  You should have cut that shit inmediatly when they started shitting on her through chat  you just let them walk all over you and make fun of your gf  Thats weak shit  no wonder you cant get a normal gf  grow some balls YTA  She’s given you an out and was awkward around your friends because she knows how people look at her  She liked you for you  Your friends want you to end up with a golddigger  If you had stood up for her  they might’ve stopped You re 35  that s way too old to be caring if your friends think your gf is hot YTA  35 year old man boy  as you can see opposite sex dose not care you have PHD if you are low confidence clown and I’d be curious if these work friends have “hot wives or GFs”    Also from experience  the more attractive the girl is more crazy she is  Sometimes you get a unicorn  If I were you I’d be counting my lucky stars that a nice girl is willing to do that for a soon to be over the hill fatter old man                             Post Title  AITA For cutting out a toxic friend just because they didn t have the same opportunities as me content  Sorry in advance for the long post but this situation spans a few years   I  27F  had a friend 28NB  who I’ll call Ash  We became close in high school  We did everything together  movies  hanging out at the mall  sleepovers  etc  Something that is important to know  Ash came from a poorer background than myself  My family is not rich  more like middle class  We had our struggles but we were fortunate enough not to ever have to wonder where our next meal would come from while Ash has   Over Ash’s last year of high school and my junior year  they went to community college and I ended up at a decent state university  Still  we remained close and called each other all the time  I was convinced we’d be friends for life   Well  after college while I was looking for full time work I got a job at a pet store where Ash already worked  they helped me get the position  It wasn’t a good place to work  the owner was honestly rude and high strung to her employees  Anyway  Ash would go around telling people “Yeah  I got OP a job and off her butt” Meanwhile I was working on applying for my master s degree  It made me feel like crap when it was phrased that way   My sister  25F  entered my room one night after hearing Ash say that  She sat on my bed and started pointing out how Ash did said things like that a lot  Some of the examples she pointed out are     I always pay for food when we go out  usually when Ash mentioned that they had not eaten in x amount of days    Ash always made a big deal of me paying them for something if they did end up paying but never did it with our other friends   When a classmate of mine passed that our older brother was close to  I mentioned I did not want to listen to a song that would remind me of him  Ash proceeded to put the song on crank it up and belt the lyrics out    I tripped once and accidentally broke a bag when I reached out to break my fall  Ash made me buy them a new one despite the fact I’d bruised up my leg pretty good   If I mentioned someone said I look like I lost weight  I m plus size   Ash would say “You probably haven’t  they just haven’t seen you in a while”   We brought them on our vacation with us and I spent more than half the trip sitting inside because they didn’t want to burn   Practically letting them move into my bedroom when their parents split up but never getting a thank you to me or our parents  I at first didn’t listen to my sister because I didn’t see any of it as being a problem   Then my birthday happened  They “took me out” for my birthday to see a movie then after opened up their phone and subtracted the amount of my movie ticket from an apparent tab they had about how much money they owed me and said they no longer owed me anything with a big grin   On my birthday   Again  I made excuses and tried to ignore it but it sat in the back of my head for a week  On Xmas day  I realized our priorities were different   I almost passed out cold at the kitchen table randomly  My brother who was a volunteer firefighter at the time had to help me to the couch and he took my vitals  I was fine mostly  just really weak  I texted Ash what happened and that I couldn’t hang out the next day  They said okay and that they hoped I felt better   The problem turned out to be nothing serious  I had a cold and grabbed the cold medicine that was meant for my mother who has high BP and it caused my BP to drop dramatically when it kicked in   I decided not to text Ash first for once  I wanted to see if they’d reach out to me and they never did  After two months of not receiving a single text from them  I dropped off the gift I got them at their work and told their coworker to tell them it was from me  It was a last ditch effort to see if I’d get any kind of an answer  Crickets   2 years passed before I heard them  We reconnected because a former mutual friend was moving out of state and they wanted to throw this person a party  We went to sit down and talk for a while  during the conversation they apologized for not reaching out after that Xmas and I ended up letting them back in   By this time I was 24 and in my MA program going part time and paying out of my own money while living at home  I was working full time in a medical practice and helped them get a job at the same place because they really needed to make better money  Stupid  I know   Their time there was not good  They constantly had this superior attitude toward everyone there  Particularly the other tech  Granted  this person was transphobic and prone to random outbursts and would pin random blame on people who weren’t even in the room at the time and I did not like her either but I could be civil and have conversations without snapping at each other for the sake of not losing my job  I don’t know what happened between them but I came back from a few days off after this girl started and they suddenly hated each other  I think whatever happened contributed to the way they acted in the office   We also talked about my ADHD diagnosis a lot because I was explaining the extra accommodations I got including a note taker and extended test taking time in school  Ash mentioned that they think they have Autism because they’re not socially literate  I told them they should research more about ADHD in female presenting people  they didn t come out as NB until after we reconnected  because Autism and ADHD have a tendency to either go hand in hand or even be misdiagnosed as one or the other  I was tested a few times in my childhood so we could keep my accommodations   Ash got mad at me and was quiet the rest of the time I was there   I later got a text telling me that self diagnosis is valid with three TikTok videos talking about it  I was annoyed so I sent back an article from a medical journal detailing the similarities and differences between the two and how they interact   A few days later  Ash was suddenly saying they have ADHD and mimicking some of my ticks like picking at my lip or digging my nails into the back of my hand  These were things they never did before  I tried to tell myself that ADHD sometimes causes people to mimic things others do  and Ash may have been masking before   Another thing was  Ash would only seem to want to hang out with me on their own  They would regularly make it clear to me that their apartment that they now shared with their BF and friend was always open to people  but whenever I would ask if I could come over I was told “Oh  we re having a D D session tonight” They had one every night   I like D D and the one campaign I was in always got pushed and I was berated for wanting to miss one night because it was Father’s day  There was also one night where I asked if I could do a maneuver a specific way and the rules of the world don’t allow for it  which is fine that’s why I asked  I made a “that’s rude” comment in a joking manner  the two other people chuckled but Ash’s boyfriend snapped at me and I sat there confused and just said it was a joke and one of the others told him that it was a reference to a character  All he said was “oh” and the campaign moved on  I did not get an apology   The next day Ash told me that they don’t like when I say that comment because it makes them feel bad  So I stopped saying it   I think that was when it started to hit me  That Ash wasn’t a good friend to me  I was back to doing the same things as before and paying for things for them that I shouldn’t be  I tried to back off with it  to see how it would affect us  and I noticed more passive aggressive tendencies from them and their BF   The last straw was when I gave Ash a big container of soup my mom made  she always makes too much   I later found it a month later sitting in the breakroom fridge  I asked Ash to take it home and clean the container so I could return it  Their response was “You know I don’t like touching gross and old food” in frustration I glared at them and walked out because I didn’t want to snap   The next morning  the container was gone and their BF came in and dropped it on the counter  now clean  I gave him a dirty look and said “Finally  it’s been a month since I gave that to Ash ” He looked a little surprised but didn’t say anything   That was a Friday  Once I was home I texted Ash that I was done and to not talk to me for anything but work again  I admit it was nasty  but I detailed some of the above and said I was tired of being the one to give the most as a friend  I know I shouldn’t have  but I had a little to drink  and ended it with “You always say that your friends leave you and treat you like crap later on  Maybe that’s because you’re the problem  I hope your BF gets a clue before you marry and leaves you ”  It felt so good  I didn’t regret telling them off but I knew I shouldn’t have added that last bit about their BF  Regardless  I decided not to apologize and just move on  A few months later  I got a good full time job and left  Ash stormed out of the office a week after I put in my notice when one of our coworkers asked me about what I would be making doing  she was interested in the same field    What brings me to is a conversation with an old classmate  We were always friendly but never close to either of us  She asked me why Ash and I were not friends anymore and I gave them a rundown of why  That classmate told me I was AH because Ash came from a difficult home life and it wasn’t fair to expect them to cater to someone who came from a privileged background and that Ash is still poor and working a barely more than minimum wage job   I didn’t know what to do  so I just changed the subject  Now I’m sitting here in my room with no one to talk to wondering if she was right  Ash was the only friend I had for a long time and now I don’t make new ones because I didn’t want to be hurt again but I can’t help but think that I’m the one in the wrong AITA   EDITED TO FIX LINE BREAKSComments  NTA  You didn’t cut them out over the opportunities they had or didn’t  You cut them out because their behavior was routinely thoughtless  self centered  and rude to you NTA  You did the right thing removing this person from your life  They sound like the kind of person that the world owes them something NTA  You did what you had to to protect yourself from this self centered jerkNTA  being poor is not an excuse to treat your friends like shit  It sounds like you let a lot of things slide over the years  and they figured you would put up with anything  Move on  don t let one bad friendship hold you back NTA  You weren’t asking Ash to cater to you  you were asking for the basic respect and consideration you would expect from anyone  but especially from a close friend  While I do think the difference in your upbringing contributed to why they are more particular about their possessions and felt like they could comfortably ask you to pay them back  that doesn’t give them permission to take advantage of you and take you for granted  It sounds to me that they were a resentful of what you had and would act out because of it but that doesn’t mean you should allow yourself to be disrespected    Plus many of these aren’t related to money or possessions at all and seemed like they were just trying to hurt you and invalidate your feelings  Even if not intentionally trying to hurt you  it’s definitely not with your consideration in mind  That alone is a good enough reason to not be friends                             Post Title  AITAH for being upset that my friend is rude to me content  I want to be clear that this is a throwaway and in no way am I trying to use this post as a roundabout way to promote anything  I am Eric   21M  I am seeking your thoughts on this situation and advice  This may also be long winded  but there s a lot to catch up on so I apologize and thank you for reading   I have a friend named  let s say   Erin  20F   We have been friends since sophmore year of high school  We hung out a good bit in and outside of school  but mostly hung out online playing games  In late 2018  I decided for fun to start streaming on Twitch  She would hang out in my chat and it was a good way to connect with her and other like minded folk  About a year later  she started streaming as well    After graduation  I moved across the country to be closer to family and for college  We stayed close by streaming together  Apex Legends  Fortnite  etc  or hanging out in each other s streams  along with just chatting via discord    I want to preface this by saying  I really like this friend  as a friend   It s nice to have a gaming buddy  someone for advice and help with Twitch  and just a friend in general  I will say that she is an artist so she has made my emotes and layouts for me  she has donated a decent chunk of change over time to me  subscribes every month  and mods in my chat  which are all a huge help  It makes me feel as though I owe her somewhat   In the past  we have had our arguments about what have you twitch wise or just as friends  If it is  really bad   we just don t talk for a few days and eventually move on  But within the past year  it seems as though she has gotten really mean and rude towards me  I will say that the majority of the time  this is on Twitch streams or discord calls  while on stream   rather than private messages    I am writing this because just tonight  something happened that killed my mood and brought up this whole subject enough that I can t sleep    I had a long day and people in my discord asked me to stream something tonight  I said I had a long day  car issues  college  etc  I was tired and wasn t there to commit to a high energy stream  I decided to destress with a Fortnite stream  but made it clear I wasn t going to be super energized  we ll just chill in chat and play a few games  Erin comes in and asks me to switch to Apex Legends  which I ignored cause I  chose what I was doing  Then she asked if she could join me in Duos in Fortnite  which I said was fine  but I had to head to bed soon  In the period between the time she asked and the time I died in game  she said   Eric  shut up  you need to make your streams more entertaining please  i m bored    i said i was low energy tonight and   STREAMS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ENTERTAINING   IM WATCHING A GUY SUCK AT FORTNITE   In defense  I jokingly said how she isn t a pro herself and she said   i make it funny  you don t   Then   Guitarlaw  another chatter in stream   please tell him you hate the stream please   The chatter said  sure  Erin said  YEAAAAA   Later   you need a funny bit   you think making puns out of his name is funny   like bro it s not all about you  Jack  fellow streamer friend  is a funnier streamer than you  bro has bits     This is my  1 Twitch pet peeve and its  dance monkey   People wave money or sometimes just their viewership over your head and ask you to entertain them when I owe them nothing  This is my stream and in a world where I don t control much  I control and can cultivate my Twitch chat  I have been streaming for 5 years now  I am not doing it to  go big   Its just fun to hangout with friends I know have through streaming and honestly really helps with my lonelieness since I am so far away from  home   I have developed over that time a very  take it or leave it  mentality about watching my stream  You want to pop in  chat  have a good time  Awesome  so happy and thankful you re here  Don t want to watch don t have time whatever  Totally fine  my stream isn t that important and life is busy  Not everything I will stream will be your cup of tea as well and that s totally okay too  But when you come into stream and tell me it s boring  I need to be better  so and so is so much better  etc   it ticks me off so much  And so this is multiplied times ten when it is a FRIEND    I asked her when I died if we were playing and she goes   no cause I don t feel like it now  I don t want to play with an unfunny guy  you make me wanna rip my hair out   Mind you  this is all said in a public Twitch chat with other viewers watching    In the past year  there have been more situations where she is just like this  She says it is an online persona and that she is mean in chat  but not IRL  I am very self conscious and I can take some teasing  but after a while  it just feels rude  I also feel like Erin s opinion matters more to me than a random chatter  Someone says the stream sucks and they can be banned  whereas Erin s opinion matters  In all honestly  I think her   online persona  thing is an excuse and she is just using it to be an ass    During a conversation previously  just last month  over discord DMs  she said  my mom told me that i can be very mean when im on my period  so yeah  if im every extra bitchy towards you just know its cause of my period   i know theres been times in your twitch chat where i have been mean and i apologize  can t help it  most of the time i am kidding and theres that 5% when im not on my period and i just dont stop myself from being mean      Another time I complained about comments people made about me in stream  mostly her  but i wanted to go to her and act like it was the other comments that were bothering me to see what she would say about mean twitch comments    You re the one making the choice to put yourself out there and if you can t handle what you get back in return then maybe it just isn t for you    April 2023    It is for me  I adore streaming to my  on a really good night  ten or so viewers  We have a great time and I go on tangents about whatever it may be  I have grown geniune online friendships that out of this  Seriously  it helps me with my depression to get up and see  UmbrellaMan12  or whatever and just ask how they re doing and play some games    At the very same time  when she says these type of things to me  I ll be real and say that I say simular things back  which is fine if we are doing this friendly back and forth but it always seems like she can say whatever she wants to me and  its just a joke  man up   but is sensitive herself  I feel like I am walking on eggshells talking with her   even when not doing something like this  just in normal conversation  she can just get pissed off of something I didn t think would even make her mad   like literally normal conversation   I would rather we didn t go back and forth at all  but it feel as though she enjoys it    For context on Erin  we graduated high school in summer 2021  Since then  I have moved and worked fulltime 40 50 hours a week for about a year and a half before enrolling in college  which I am doing now   Erin is an only child and lives at home  She hasn t gone to school and works part time at a local grocery store  which is totally fine  That said   and not to say that I am this big mature 21 year old  I think living on my own  paying expensive rent  bills  groceries  saving and buying a car  going to school and enteracting with people  etc   I think that experience has changed me for the better and I think Erin might still be a high school grad if you get what I mean  I truly don t mean anything rude by it   Here s my dilemma that I need help on   thank you so much for reading all of this  i know its a lot  What would you do  Some people have told me to cut her off or somethings along that line  As stated  she has donated done so much for me that I feel like I almost owe her to be her friend at this point  I would bet that she is pretty lonely herself  only interacting with  majority  coworkers and her parents  I like her a lot as a friend  but it is just A LOT for me  Should I try explaining to her how I feel  How would I go about doing that without her being pissed off at me or telling me to  man up   I honestly through writing this feel like I might be being used by her in some way  I apperciate what she has done for me and would like to continue this friendship  but I don t know how long it can truly continue like this  Thank you so much for your help in advance   \n"
