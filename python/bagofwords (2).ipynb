      "Article 14      Mr  Vice President   We come to new article 14   Amendment No  504 was not moved        Shri H  V  Kamath  What about 13 A  That is  amendments 89  90 and 92 of List V       Mr  Vice President  That has been held over  I was referring to No  504       Now the motion is        That article 14 form part of the Constitution        Honourable Members have been supplied with a list which indicates the manner in which I propose to conduct the proceedings of the House  No  505 has been disallowed as being verbal  506 may be moved       Pandit Thakur Dass Bhargava  May I take the liberty of pointing out that my amendment  No  505  is not mercy verbal  It is an amendment of substance also       Mr  Vice President  Then I will give my ruling later on  Mr  Naziruddin Ahmad will carry on his work       Mr  Naziruddin Ahmad  West Bengal  Muslim   Mr  Vice President  I beg to move        That in clause  1  of article 14  after the words  greater than   the words  or of a kind other than  be inserted        Sir  clause  1  provides  I am reading only the material part         No person shall be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law at the time of the commission of the offence        It guards against any punishment  greater than  is provide to be inflicted upon a person  I have attempted to insert after the words  greater than  the words  or other than  that which might have been inflicted  There are many cases where a punishment of fine only is provided  Suppose a man is fined one lakh of rupees  An Appellate Court may turn it to an imprisonment during the sitting of the Court  That will violate the provision that where fine alone is provided for  an imprisonment may be substituted on the ground that it is not  greater than  that  My amendment seeks to limit the powers of Courts to inflict punishment not only as to the extent but also to the kind  There are different kinds of punishments  fine  imprisonment  whipping  forfeiture and hanging and the like where only a particular kind of punishment is specifically provided  you should not award any punishment other than that  That is in short the effect of this amendment  Where whipping alone is provided  You cannot award a fine  Where fine alone is provided  you cannot award imprisonment or whipping or forfeiture  Where forfeiture of movables only a provided  you cannot forfeit immovables  Where forfeiture of articles relating to which crime has been committed is provided  you cannot forfeit other kinds of things  So if we leave the powers of the courts as in the clause it gives the Court the power to give any punishment not sanctioned by law  If clause  1  is to be retained  the Court should also be limited to the class of punishment provided  To me it seems that there is here a lacuna rather oversight which should be corrected       Mr  Vice President  As regards amendment No  505  I can allow the Member to move the second part of it  Pandit Thakur Dass Bhargava       Pandit Thakur Das Bhargava   Sir  I beg to move        That in clause  1  of article 14  for the words  under the law at the time of the commission  the words  under the law in force at the time of the commission  be substituted        Sir  if you kindly examine the definition of the expression  law in force  as given in the explanation under article 307  it would appear that the words  the law  and the words  the law in force  have different meanings  Moreover as the words in the previous part of the article also appear as  law in force   it is very necessary and proper in this juxtaposition that the amendment that I have suggested should be accepted  That is all I have to submit       Mr  Vice President  Amendment Nos  507  508 and 511 are of the same import  The most comprehensive one  i  e  No 507  may be moved   Amendments Nos  507  508 and 511 were not moved        Amendments Nos  509 and 510 are of similar import and may be moved together  They are in the name of Mr  Naziruddin Ahmad       Mr  Naziruddin Ahmad   Sir  I beg to move        That at the end of clause  2  of article 14  the words  otherwise than as permitted by the Code of Criminal Procedure  1898  be added        Sir  I am moving these amendments with considerbale anxiety in my mind  The first anxiety is that I may perhaps over step my time limit  they second anxiety is that there are a large number of observant and powerful eyes directed against me and I am afraid that a point of order may be taken at any time  and the third anxiety is the huge  No  against me will be echoed by honourable Members and this will reverberate as thunder clap under which my feeble  Aye  will be lost       Then the other difficulty is that I have to crave the indulgent attention of the Honourable the Chairman of the Drafting Committee to the point I am raising  I shall restrict my point strictly to the limits of relevancy       Sir  the words which I seek to insert deals with an important principle of criminal procedure  Clause  2  which I seek to amend runs as follows         2  No person shall be punished for the same offence more than once        A very sacred sentiment has prompted the introduction of this clause  but considered from the point of view of criminal law  it has its loop holes       Clause  2  seems to be rather sweeping  There are cases where a man may be legally punished twice for the same offence  and I shall submit the circumstances  with the relevant laws  Sir  the principal which deals with this subject finds a place in section 403  sub section  1  of the Code of Criminal Procedure  The point of this  The law of punishment twice has been enacted       Shri T  T  Krishnamachari  Sir  on a point of order  Can any Member of this House move an amendment referring to an enactmente  itself is out of order       Mr  Naziruddin Ahmad  Anything else may be out of order  but not the amendment  We have already referred to and saved  existing laws   enactments of subordinate legislatures in article 9 and in other places  I was only referring for handy consideration to the Criminal Procedure Code  I cannot pretend to submit that Section 403  or any principle embodied in it  or any sound principle even is binding upon this House  not even the soundest of propositions  because this is a sovereign House       I was submitting for consideration certain principles of the Criminal Procedure  not that I suggested at all that they will be binding on this House  but only that they worthy of consideration       Sir  it often happens  I shall submit examples from general principles because I think they would be more acceptable to Mr  Krishnamachari  it often happens that a man is punished by a Court which has no jurisdiction  It is a very ordinary experience in criminal Courts that the Judge on appeal or the High Court or the Privy Council  and now the Federal Court and later on the future Supreme Court  may and does find that the conviction is without jurisdiction  Meantime  the man has been convicted  If you say that he cannot be convicted twice  then orders of re trial by appellate and revisional Courts would be absolutely out of the question  If a man is tried by a Magistrate or a Court having no jurisdiction  and if he is punished  that is the first punishment       And then if it is found that the Court had no jurisdiction to try the case  what is often done is that there is a re trial  But if you enact the principle of clause  2  that a man shall not be punished for the same offence more than once  the effect would be that if a man is punished by a Court of competent jurisdiction but there is a lacuna in the trial  or by a Court of competent jurisdiction the result will be to shut out any further trial at all  Are trial after a conviction is an ordinary incident of daily experience in criminal Courts       Sometimes  Sir                    After a pause       Sir  I desire to monopolise the attention of the Honourable Member the Chairman of the Drafting Committee  otherwise it will be useless to argue  If he says  No   the whole House will echo him       Mr  Vice President  Dr  Ambedkar  Mr  Naziruddin demands your wholehearted attention  He says that if you say  No   the House will say  No    Laughter        Mr  Naziruddin Ahmad  The point which I was submitting is a point of general importance  The point is that if a man is convicted by a court of law  that is the first conviction  it may be that there is some lacuna in the trial  The accused appeals to the Court of Sessions  The Court finds that there was a lacuna in the trial or that the Court had no jurisdiction  But it may order a re trial  Clause  2  which would effectively prevent further trial because it may involve a second conviction  There may be a first conviction of an offender in the hands of a Court  and this clause will effectively prevent a re trial order by a superior court  This is one of the simplest examples  The principle should be not merely convicted  but the principle should be that a man cannot be tried again  tried twice  if he is acquitted or convicted by a Court of competent jurisdiction  while the conviction or acquittal stands effective  In fact  it is not the first conviction that is important  it is the ultimate legality and finality of the conviction that has to be respected  the finality should attach not only to conviction but also to acquittal  What are you going to do with regard to a person who is finally acquitted after a fair trial  and when the acquittal is not set aside and is therefore final and binding  You say nothing about that  You simply say that a man should not be convicted twice for the same offence  A man acquitted shall also not be liable to be tried again  You say nothing about that but confine you attention to the bogey of double punishment  I submit that the so called theory of double punishment is not all and does not give a complete picture  Take for example  a man fined Rs  50 for an offence by a Magistrate having no jurisdiction  then he appeals to an appellate Court  The appellate Court will  by virtue of clause  2  be precluded from sending it for re trial on any technical ground  even on the ground that the Court had no jurisdiction       The relevant section which caused some amount of suspicion in the mind of a distinguished Member of the House  Mr  T  T  Krishnamachari  I shall with his permission and with your permission  Sir  and with the permission of the House  read  Not that it is binding  but it is a crystallised wisdom which has been handed down to us from generation to generation  Sub section  1  of section 403 says        A person who has been once tried by a Court of competent jurisdiction for an offence and convicted or acquitted of such offence  shall  while such conviction or acquittal remains in force  not be liable to be tried again for the same offence        I think  Sir  this is the proper form  It may be argued that the Criminal Procedure Code is a sufficient safeguard against injustice  but if you introduce it here it is a justiciable right  and we have already provided that any violation of any fundamental right is justiciable and would nullify all existing laws contrary  and therefore it will have the effect of abolishing or rather nullifying the wholesome law as laid down in sub section  1  of section 403  I submit that the clause has got to be very carefully considered and  if necessary  should be re drafted       I submit that double punishment for the same offence in such cases does not in fact work injustice  What happens in such cases is that the punishment already suffered or inflicted is taken into account or adjusted in giving the final punishment in a re trial  That is the effect of this amendment       Mr  Vice President  Do you intend to move amendment No 509       Mr  Naziruddin Ahmad  No  Sir  It deals with the same principle and I do not wish to move it       Mr  Vice President  I have found from the last two days  experience that 9 30 a m  is too early an hour for many Members of the House  They seem to think that others will come at the proper time and they need not come  with the result that there is difficulty in starting our work at the proper time  I have therefore decided that from tomorrow we shall start at 10 a m  and break up at 1 30 p m       The Assembly then adjourned till Ten of the Clock on Friday the 3rd December  1948    Honourable Members  Certainly                                                         DRAFT CONSTITUTION contd                                                                                Article 14 contd        Mr  Vice President   We shall now resume discussion of article 14  Amendment 510 was moved  509 will be put to vote  So we next come to 512       Kazi Syed Karimuddin  C  P    Berar  Muslim   Mr  Vice President  Sir  I beg to move        That in article 14  the following be added as clause  4       4  The right of the people to be secure in their persons  houses  papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized        This is a very important amendment  You will be pleased to find that this finds place as article 4 in the American Constitution and in the Irish Constitution there are clauses 2  and  5  which are similar and in the German Constitution there are articles 114 and 115 on the same lines  In the book of Dr  Ambedkar  Minorities and States  on page 11  item No  10  a similar provision has been made  Thus  this is an amendment  the correctness of which cannot be challenged  What is the situation in India today  In India  in practically every province  there are Goonda Act and Public Safety Act which do not provide for any appeals or representations  and which give no opportunity to the persons concerned to defend themselves  Arrests are made without warrant and searches without justification  We are being governed by lawless laws and there is no remedy for the redress of grievances on account of unauthorised arrests and searches       We have seen in 1947  and in the beginning of 1948  that hundreds of thousands of people were arrested and houses were searched merely on suspicion  The result is that the morale of the members of the Muslim minority community was undermined and they were treated just like criminals in the country  I will give the house one very important instance  Whenever we went to an aerodrome to go to Delhi  our belongings were searched without any reason  without any cause and without any warning  I will now give another instance  When there was police action in Hyderabad  every Muslim worth the name was arrested without any justification in the adjoining provinces  If those Muslims were really traitors they ought to have been prosecuted  punished and hanged  But people who had nothing whatever to do with Hyderabad were arrested under the pretence that they were taken only under protective custody  Well  if they were taken only under protective custody  why were their women and children who were outside not taken under this protective custody       Therefore my submission is that unless this fundamental right that I have asked for in this amendment is guaranteed  there will be no end to these arrests without warrants and to these searches without justifications  I have moved this amendment in the earnest hope that it would be accepted       Mr  Vice President  The next amendment in the List is the one standing in the name of Mr  Kakkan       Shri P  Kakkan  Madras  General   Sir  I do not want to move it  But  with your permission I wish to speak on it       Mr  Vice President  That I cannot permit  I can give the honourable Member an opportunity to speak in the course of the general discussion on article 14  I think  as there are no other amendments to this article  the House can now take up the general discussion of this article  Mr  Kakkan may now make the speech he wanted to       Shri P  Kakkan  Mr  Vice President  I had given notice of an amendment to this article only with a view to speak on it       Sir  what I have got to say concerns the jail administration  In the jails they make a distinction between prisoners and prisoners in allotting duties in the jails  If a prisoner belongs to the Harijan community he is compelled to do scavenging work  no matter what his class or rank or education is  Prisoners belonging to other communities are not similarly forced to do scavenging work  On this occasion I desire to express my opinion and my feeling that this distinction in the matter of the allotment of work to prisoners inside the jails should be removed forthwith  Sir  I know from experience that the members of the Harijan community are treated in jails very cruelly  as if they are God s creatures and that He created them for doing scavenging work  I earnestly hope that this distinction will be removed hereafter and that Harijans will get impartial treatment everywhere  It is with this object that I have stated in my amendment that no person convicted for any offence shall be compelled to work in jail  caste war  in respect of religion  caste  race or class  I thank you  Sir  for giving me this opportunity to speak       Shri T  T  Krishnamachari  Madras  General   Mr  Vice President  Sir  the point I have to place before the House happens to be a comparatively narrow one  In this article 14  clause  2  reads thus   No person shall be punished for the same offence more than once   It has been pointed out to me by more Members of this House that this might probably affect cases where  as in the case of an official of Government who has been dealt with departmentally and punishment has been inflicted  he cannot again be prosecuted and punished if he had committed a criminal offence  or  per contra  if a Government official had been prosecuted and sentenced to imprisonment or fine by a court  it might preclude the Government from taking disciplinary action against him  Though the point is a narrow one and one which is capable of interpretation whether this provision in this particular clause in the Fundamental Rights will affect the discretion of Government acting under the rules of conduct and discipline in regard to its own officers  I think  when we are putting a ban on a particular type of action  it is better to make the point more clear       I recognise that I am rather late now to move an amendment  What I would like to do is to word the clause thus   No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once   If my Honourable Friend Dr  Ambedkar will accept the addition of the words  prosecuted and  before the word  punished  and if you  Sir  and the House will give him permission to do so  it will not merely be a wise thing to do but it will save a lot of trouble for the Governments of the future  That is the suggestion I venture to place before the House  It is for the House to deal with it in whatever manner it deems fit       Mr  Vice President  Does the House give the permission asked for by Shri T  T  Krishnamachari       Honourable Members  Yes       Mr  Vice President  Now I will call upon Dr  Ambedkar to move the amendment suggested by Shri T  T  Krishnamachari       The Honourable Dr  B  R  Ambedkar   Mr  Vice President  Sir  with regard to the amendments that have been moved to this article  I can say that I am prepared to accept the amendment moved by Mr  T  T  Krishnamachari  Really speaking  the amendment is not necessary but as certain doubts have been expressed that the word  punished  may be interpreted in a variety of ways  I think it may be desirable to add the words  prosecuted and punished        With regard to amendments Nos  506 and 509 moved by my friend  Mr  Naziruddin Ahmad                  Mr  Naziruddin Ahmad  It is No  510       The Honourable Dr  B  R  Ambedkar  Anyhow  I have examined the position the whole day yesterday and I am satisfied that no good will be served by accepting these amendments  I am however prepared to accept amendment No 512 moved by Mr  Karimuddin  I think it is a useful provision and may find a place in our Constitution  There is nothing novel in it because the whole of the clause as suggested by him is to be found an the Criminal Procedure Code so that it might be said in a sense that this is already the law of the land  It is perfectly possible that the legislatures they are so important so far as personal liberty is concerned that it is very desirable to place these provisions beyond the reach of the legislature and I am therefore prepared to accept his amendment       With regard to amendment No  513 moved by my friend  Mr  Kakkan            An Honourable Member  It was not moved       Mr  Vice President  What about amendments Nos  505 and 506       The Honourable Dr  B  R  Ambedkar  I have already said that I am not prepared to accept amendment Nos  506 and 510       Mr  Vice President  Have you anything to say about amendment No  505  the second part of it as modified by amendment No  92 in List V  Perhaps you have overlooked it  It is in the name of Pandit Thakur Dass Bhargava       The Honourable Dr  B  R  Ambedkar  I accept the amendment moved by him       Mr  Vice President   I am putting the amendments one by one to the vote       Amendment No  505 as modified by amendment No  92 of List V  I understand that Dr  Ambedkar accepts it  The question is        That in clause  1  of article 14  for the words  under the law at the time of the commission  the words  under the law in force at the time of the commission  be substituted   The amendment was adopted       Mr  Vice President  Amendment No  506  The question is        That in clause  1  of article 14  after the words  greater than  the words  or of a kind other than  be inserted   The amendment was negatived       Mr  Vice President  Amendment No  510  The question is        That at the end of clause  2  of article 14  the words other wise than as permitted by the Code of Criminal Procedure  1898  be added   The amendment was negatived       Mr  Vice President  Amendment No  512 moved by Kazi Syed Karimuddin and accepted by Dr  Ambedkar  The question is       That in article 14  the following be added as clause 4       4  The right of the people to be secure in their persons  houses  papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized        I think the  Ayes  have it       Shri T  T  Krishnamachari  The Noes have it       Mr  Vice President  I will again put it to the vote       I think the  Ayes  have it       Shri T  T  Krishnamachari  No  Sir  the Noes have it       Mr  Vice President  I shall first of all call for a show of hands   The Division Bell was rung        Shri Mahavir Tyagi  United Provinces  General   May I propose that this question might be postponed for the time being and a chance be given for the Members to confer between themselves and arrive at a decision  Even the British House of Commons  sometimes converts itself into a committee to give various parties a chance to confer and arrive at an agreed solution       Mr  Vice President  I am prepared to postpone the voting on this amendment provided the House gives me the requisite permission  I would request the House to be calm  This is not the way to come to decisions which must be reached through co operative effort and through goodwill  Does the House give me the necessary power to postpone voting on this       The Honourable Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru   Mr  Vice President  Sir  as apparently a slight confusion has arisen in many members  minds on this point  I think  Sir  that the suggestion made is eminently desirable  that we might take up this matter a little later  and we may proceed with other things  It will be the wish of the House that will prevail of course  I would suggest to you  Sir  and to the House that your suggestion be accepted       Dr  B  V  Keskar  United Provinces  General   Can it be done after the division bell has rung       Mr  Vice President  I never go by technicalities  I shall continue to use common sense as long as I am here  I have little knowledge of technicalities  but I have some knowledge of human nature  I know that in the long run it is good sense  it is common sense  it is goodwill which alone will carry weight  I ask the permission of the House to postpone the voting       Honourable Members  Yes  Article 15       Mr  Vice President  Then we shall pass on to the next article  The next amendment is No  514 but as Mr  Lari is absent  I shall pass on to the next article       Shri T  T  Krishnamachari   May I suggest that discussion of this article be postponed  as it is being examined and the Members of the House would like to take some more time for the consideration of this particular article  Article 15 A      Mr  Vice President   Very well  Then I pass on to article 15 A  New article   Amendment No  534 seeks to rule out capital punishment  I think it is blocked in view of the fact that a similar amendment was put to vote and rejected   Amendments Nos  535 and 536 were not moved   Article 16       Mr  Vice President   The motion before the House is that article 16 form part of the Constitution        An Honourable Member  What about article 15       Mr  Vice President  Article 15 has been held over  Honourable Members must have been inattentive not to hear the suggestion made by Mr  T  T  Krishnamachari and accepted by the Chair  Amendment No  537 I rule out of order as it is a negative amendment   Amendments Nos  538  539 and 540 were not moved        Amendment No  542 is already covered by the provision relating to ban on cow killing passed by the House previously       Shri C  Subramaniam  Madras  General   Mr  Vice President  Sir  I find some difficulty in accepting this article as an article coming under fundamental rights  The article reads   Subject to the provisions of article 244 of this Constitution and of any law made by Parliament  trade  commerce and intercourse throughout the territory of India shall be free   Before referring to the difficulty  which I feel  I will refer the House to the sections in the Draft Constitution which deals with trade and commerce       There are three Articles 243  244 and 245 which deal with this subject  inter state trade and commerce  in the body of the Draft  Then in the list of legislative powers in the Union list  we find in article 73  inter state trade and commerce subject to the provisions of entry 33 of List No  II   Then item 32 in List II is  trade and commerce within the state  markets and fairs   and item 33 refers to the  regulation of trade  commerce and intercourse on other States for the purposes of the provisions of article 244 of this Constitution   Therefore  you will find inter state trade and commerce  subject to article 244  is a Union subject  Parliament can deal with it  Trade and commerce within the state and inter state commerce as provided in article 244 are given to the State Legislatures  You will find  Sir  that in article 244  even though it might be inter state trade and commerce  the State Legislature is given certain powers to impose certain taxes and impose certain restrictions  Having this in mind  if we come to article 16  we find the words  subject to the provisions of article 244 of this Constitution   that is  even in respect of inter state trade and commerce  the State Legislature has been given certain powers and that is not touched by this article  Therefore leaving that  the article would read  subject to the provisions of any law made by Parliament  trade and commerce and intercourse through the territory of India shall be free   I really fail to understand how this can be a fundamental right and whether there is any right at all reserved  The very conception of a fundamental right is that there is a certain right taken out of the province of the legislature either of the Union or the State  To put it in other words  the sovereignty vests in the public  but that sovereignty is delegated to the legislatures or the sovereignty is expressed through the legislatures in respect of certain subjects       But  in respect of certain fundamental rights we say the Parliament or the Government shall have no power of interference  So much so  the sovereignty of the people is absolute in that respect  It is neither delegated  nor is anybody else authorised to deal with that sovereignty  If we examine this article in that view  what is the residue of right left which could not be touched either by the legislature of the Union or by the legislature of the State  You find stated here   Subject to the provisions of any law made by Parliament  trade  commerce and intercourse throughout the territory of India shall be free   Here  the sovereignty of the Parliament is absolute  There is no right which is taken out of the province of the legislatures  The right which is reserved here as a Fundamental right should be one  which neither the Union Legislature nor the State Legislature can touch  There is no such right left here  Mind you  here the wording in article 16 is   Subject to any law made by Parliament  without any limitation whatsoever  So much so  it comes to this  there shall be free trade throughout the territories of India  subject to the powers of Parliament  I respectfully submit that that would not be a fundamental right       I know there are certain friends of mine who think that the vesting of powers in the Parliament as against the State itself is a fundamental right  That was what was expressed by certain friends  If that logic is extended to its conclusion  all the subjects dealt with in List I would be fundamental rights  That is not the case  The very conception of a fundamental right is that neither the Parliament  nor the State legislatures shall have power to interfere  Here  you make the Parliament sovereign  Only subject to the powers of Parliament  there shall be free trade  commerce and intercourse throughout the territories of India  I find it difficult to see what is the right which has been taken out of the province of the legislatures  either the Parliament or the State legislatures  and which has been reserved here as a fundamental right  It may be all right to say that in respect of free trade  only the Parliament shall have power  That is allocation of administrative powers or legislative powers between the Union legislature and the State legislature  Certainly that is not a fundamental right  As one of my friends pithily put it  it is a fundamental right in favour of the Parliament  it is not a right in favour of any citizen or class of citizens  In these circumstances  I wish the honourable Mover  though I find him preoccupied with other things   I do not know whether he has followed my speech  to explain how this comes under the Chapter on Fundamental Rights  and what is the right reserved       Mr  Vice President  May I suggest  Mr  Subramaniam  that you make a definite suggestion so that Dr  Ambedkar may be in a position to reply       Shri C  Subramaniam  The definite suggestion is this  For the sake of Dr  Ambedkar  I shall state my point again  My complaint in regard to article 16 is this  There is no right which has been taken out of the province of the legislature  either of the Union or of the States  to say that a fundamental right has been reserved in article 16  Because  you will find it is stated here   Subject  leaving alone reference to article 244  to the provisions of any law made by Parliament  trade and commerce and intercourse throughout the territory of India shall be free   You see the right is subject to any law made by Parliament without any restrictions whatsoever  You have secured the sovereignty of the Parliament in respect of this subject  and Parliament can do anything  To be a fundamental right  it should have been taken out of the province of the legislatures  either of the Union or of the States  I find there is left no residue of any right which could not be touched either by Parliament or by the State legislature and as such  it would not properly come under the Chapter on Fundamental Rights  It may be a matter of allocation of powers between the Parliament and the State legislatures in saying that the Parliament alone shall deal with subjects relating to free trade within the territories of India  We can as well put in entry 73 of List I  You canal so make some restriction in entries 32 and 33 of List II  that it shall be subject to matters relating to free trade in India  I would request the Honourable mover  to enlighten me whether  as a matter of fact  there is any right left which has been taken out of the province of the legislatures and the Government and whether it will be proper to have article 16 here  in this chapter dealing with fundamental rights       The Honourable Shri K  Santhanam  Madras  General   Sir  the only way to test whether article 16 is necessary is to find out the consequences of deleting article 16  Suppose article 16 is not there  what will happen  According to the lists in the schedule  the Centre will have the right to legislate on all matters of trade between the various provinces  and according to article 243  no province can make any discrimination against any province or State  According to article 244  there can be no discrimination taxation  According to article 244  b   every State  this includes every provincial legislature  will have the right to impose by law such reasonable restrictions on the freedom of trade  commerce or intercourse with that State as may be required in the public interests  Therefore  each provincial legislature and each State legislature will have the right to impose restrictions on the freedom of trade  commerce or intercourse  Supposing a variety of restrictions are imposed by all the legislatures and it is found desirable to rationalise them  to bring them into some kind of uniformity  there will be no power vested in any agency  Article 16 gives that power to the Parliament  It cannot interfere with the provincial jurisdiction so far as trade and commerce are concerned within that particular province       Shri C  Subramaniam  That authority is provided for in article 245       The Honourable Shri K  Santhanam  Article 245 says  Parliament may by law appoint such authority as it considers appropriate for the carrying out of the provisions of articles 243 and 244 of this Constitution and confer on the authority so appointed such powers and such duties as it thinks necessary   This is only for the purpose of regulation  it does not provide any legislative power for any co ordination  correlation or standardisation of all the restrictions that may be imposed by the various legislatures  and therefore  that power is contained in article 16  Mr  Subramaniam asks  then it means that the whole power is taken out of the hands of the province  I say  it is not       Shri C  Subramaniam  My point is this  A fundamental right is not a question of conferring power on Parliament or on the State legislature  it is taking away both from the Union Parliament and from the State legislature  that alone is a fundamental right  Fundamental rights do not deal with allocation of powers at all       The Honourable Shri K  Santhanam  I do not think Mr  Subramaniam is correct  A fundamental right may consist of this provision that the State legislature shall not interfere in one matter and that that matter can be interfered with only by Parliament  or a fundamental right may be that the Parliament shall not interfere with a matter and only the State legislature may do it  Distribution of powers and the consequent results on the citizens are as much matters of fundamental rights which accrue to the individual  If all the clauses on fundamental rights are scrutinised you will find that in many cases  we have made provision that in this matter  the Parliament may interfere  but the State legislature may not interfere  Therefore  I think that in the interests of freedom of trade  article 16 is absolutely essential and without article 16  the whole structure may become so complicated that almost fancy restrictions and fancy laws may be made by the provincial legislatures  and the internal trade of India may become clogged and obstructed  Therefore  I suggest that article 16 should continue       Shri M  Ananthasayanam Ayyangar    Madras  General   Sir  I do not find any inconsistency nor do I find article 16 unnecessary  I agree with my friend  Mr  Subramaniam that if there is nothing left and the whole sphere of inter state commerce can be regulated either by the States concerned or by the Parliament  there is no need for Fundamental right but I do not agree that there is nothing left as he expects or as he is afraid  Some rights of freedom of speech etc  are given under article 13  Article 16 ensures freedom of trade  commerce and intercourse throughout the territory of India  That is the Fundamental Right  Exceptions are made under article 244 in favour of the States and of any law made by Parliament under the other article  So far as laws made by Parliament are concerned  Parliament can act only in so far as certain powers are conferred on it under list I  So far as the States are concerned they can come under list II  Entry No  32 in the State List refers to trade and commerce within the States  Now so far as trade and commerce within the State is concerned  it is the exclusive jurisdiction of the States  I am only giving an instance as to why this article is necessary in the Chapter on Fundamental Rights       In my presidency there are two districts  one is in the north and the other is in the south  growing cotton  one is in the Andhra and the other is in the Tamil Nadu  Today the district in the south is a progressive district and it has an umber of cotton mills and is utilising all cotton and is sending out yarn and cloth to other parts of the Presidency  There is a move in the northern district which grows cotton to establish certain spinning mills  We will assume that the Madras Government tries to impose certain restrictions and says that the new spinning mill that is going to be established in Cuddappah shall not send any of its yarn to any of the districts which have been already served by the Coimbatore mills  There is absolutely no provision here which prevents this  Unless a proviso is given to that extent  there is nothing preventing any State or any particular State making discrimination between one district and another  Under article 243 we cannot make any distinction between one state and another  But within the State itself there is nothing preventing a State from exercising its right by way of discrimination  There is a possibility  Let us take Bombay Presidency  Ahmedabad has got textile mills  Bombay also has got some mills  Now it is open to the legislature to prevent  as it is  the Southern portion of the Bombay Presidency from developing its resources altogether by imposing a restriction that it shall not send any of its produce or products to any other part of the Bombay Presidency       Shri C  Subramaniam  May I point out it is covered by13  g        Shri M  Ananthasayanam Ayyangar  13  g  says          to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation  trade or business        You are allowed to carry on an occupation by manufacturing this but it is not as if you can carry on a business irrespective of any other consideration       Pandit Lakshmi Kanta Maitra  West Bengal  General   It deals with commerce and intercourse       Shri M  Ananthasayanam Ayyangar  It deals with commerce and trade and there is a third word  intercourse  also  I am coming to it  So far as commerce and trade is concerned I beg to submit that it is not covered by article 13 g   Let us now refer to sub clause  6  which says          6  Nothing in sub clause  g  of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law  or prevent the State from making any law  imposing in the interests of public order  morality or health  restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub clause and in particular prescribing or empowering any authority to prescribe  the professional or technical qualifications necessary for practising any profession or carrying on any occupation  trade or business        But it does not mean that you can impose any sort of restriction  It comes under clause  g   It comes under clause  6  of article 13 and therefore there is necessity for an independent clause like article 16  which gives to every man freedom of trade  commerce and intercourse throughout the length and breadth of India       As regards the word  intercourse  also  apart from trade and commerce  for various purposes intercourse from one province to another is necessary  That is also not provided for in the Fundamental rights either in article 13or elsewhere       Shri C  Subramaniam  That is purely the province of the Parliament       Shri M  Ananthasayanam Ayyangar  With reference to States  what happens       Shri C  Subramaniam  You cannot discriminate       Mr  Vice President  I am afraid there is a lot of infringment of Parliamentary procedure and of irregularity among people who have more experience than I have       Shri M  Ananthasayanam Ayyangar  Article 243 says         No preference shall be given to one State over another nor shall any discrimination be made between one State and another by any law or regulation relating to trade or commerce  whether carried by land  water or air        This prevents discrimination between one State and another State  There is no article here which says that you ought not to discriminate between one part of a State and another part of the State  This is also covered by article 16  I beg to submit  Sir  that so far as discrimination between one area of the State and another is concerned there is no provision  and if not for any other reason  at least for this  this article is necessary       The Honourable Dr  B  R  Ambedkar   Mr  Vice President  what I understood from Mr  Subramaniam  if I have understood him correctly is not that he objects to article 16  but his objection is directed to the place which this article finds  He says that although there may be utility and necessity so far as this article is concerned  it ought not to find a place in the fundamental rights  And his second point  if I have understood him correctly is that as this article is made subject to article 244  article 16 may be completely nullified  and to use his own words  no residue of it might be left if the powers given under article 244 were exercised  I think I am right in thus summarising what he said       Now  I quite appreciate the argument that this article 16 is out of place in the list of fundamental rights  and to some extent  I agree with Mr  Subramaniam  But I shall explain to him why it was found necessary to include this matter in the fundamental rights  My Friend  Mr  Subramaniam will remember that when the Constituent Assembly began  we began under certain limitations  One of the limitations was that the Indian States would join the Union only on three subjects  foreign affairs  defence and communications  On no other matter they would agree to permit the Union Parliament to extend its legislative and executive jurisdiction  So he will realise that the Constituent Assembly  as well as the Drafting Committee  was placed under a very serious limitation  On the one hand it was realised that there would be no use and no purpose served in forming an All India Union if trade and commerce throughout India was not free  That was the general view  On the other hand  it was found that so far as the position of the States was concerned  to which I have already made a reference  they were not prepared to allow trade and commerce throughout India to be made subject to the legislative  authority of the Union Parliament  Or to put it briefly and in a different language  they were not prepared to allow trade and commerce to be included as an entry in List No  I  If it was possible for us to include trade and commerce in list I  which means that parliament will have the executive authority to make laws with regard to trade and commerce throughout India  we would not have found it necessary to bring trade and commerce under article 16  in the fundamental rights  But as that door was blocked  on account of the basic considerations which operated at the beginning of the Constituent Assembly  we had to find some place  for the purpose of uniformity in the matter of trade and commerce throughout India  under some head  After exercising considerable amount of ingenuity  the only method we found of giving effect to the desire of a large majority of our people that trade and commerce should be free throughout India  was to bring it under fundamental rights  That is the reason why  awkward as it may seem  we thought that there was not other way left to us  except to bring trade and commerce under fundamental rights  I think that will satisfy my friend Mr  Subramaniam why we gave this place to trade and commerce in the list of fundamental rights  although theoretically  I agree  that the subject is not germane to the subject matter of fundamental rights       With regard to the other argument  that since trade and commerce have been made subject to article 244  we have practically destroyed the fundamental right  I think I may fairly say that my friend Mr  Subramaniam has either not read article 244  or has misread that article  Article 244 has a very limited scope  All that it does is to give powers to the provincial legislatures in dealing with inter state commerce and trade  to impose certain restrictions on the entry of goods manufactured or transported form another State  provided the legislation is such that it does not impose any disparity  discrimination between the goods manufactured within the State and the goods imported from outside the State  Now  I am sure he will agree that that is a very limited law  It certainly does not take away the right of trade and commerce and intercourse throughout India which is required to be free       Shri C  Subramaniam  The clause says that it shall be lawful for any State to impose by law such reasonable restrictions on the freedom of trade  commerce or intercourse    as may be required in the public interests       The Honourable Dr  B  R  Ambedkar  Yes  but reasonable restrictions do not mean that the restrictions can be such as to altogether destroy the freedom and equality of trade  It does not mean that at all       Sir  I therefore submit that the article as it stands is perfectly in order and I commend it to the House       Mr  Vice President  I shall now put the article to the vote       The question before us is that         Article 16 stand part of the Constitution  The motion was adopted       Article 16 was added to the Constitution  Article 17      Mr  Vice President   Now we come to article 17       The motion before the House is that article 17 form part of the Constitution       There are a number of amendments to this article  and they will be gone through now  The first in my list is No 543  It is a negative one and is therefore ruled out       There is an amendment to this amendment  that is No  93 in List V  standing in the name of Shri Ram Chandra Upadhyaya        Interruption by Mr  Kamath        Yes  Mr  Kamath  you are observing that there are other amendments       Shri H  V  Kamath  C  P  and Berar  General   Yes  Sir  No  544       Mr  Vice President  But I have not called out that  I was dealing with No  543  and amendment No  93 to amendment No  543       Shri H  V  Kamath  But Sir  that has not been moved  How can an amendment to that amendment be moved or even called       Mr  Vice President  Are you pointing out my mistake  Have I not already confessed that I am innocent of all these rules  Is it necessary to rub it in every time  Mr  Kamath        Now  we come to amendment No  544  standing in the name of Kazi Syed Karimuddin       Shri H  V  Kamath  I do not in the least presume to advise you  Sir       Kazi Syed Karimuddin   Mr  Vice President  Sir  I move       That for article 17  the following be substituted        17  Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude such as begar except as a punishment for crime shall exist within the Union State        Sir  there is not much of a change in the amendment I am moving  But article 17 1  does not cover cases in which prisoners are asked to work  a prisoner is asked to work against his own free will  If this article is allowed to remain as it is  then the jail authorities will not be allowed to take work from the prisoners  Therefore I have mentioned the words  except as a punishment for crime   I may point out that such an article finds a place in the American Constitution also       Mr  Vice President  Amendment No  545  Shri Damodar Swarup Seth       Shri Damodar Swarup Seth  United Provinces  General   Sir  I move        That the following words be added at the beginning of clause  1  of article 17                 Servitude and serfdom in all forms as well as         I do not think this is a point on which one is required to speak at length  I will therefore  only like to submit that in some States serfdom and servitude in some form or another prevails  Moreover  in the South customs like devadas is have taken root       Pandit Lakshmi Kanta Maitra  West Bengal  General   What is serfdom as distinguished form servitude        Mr  Vice President  The Honourable Member wants to know from you what is the meaning of serfdom       Shri Damodar Swarup Seth  It is a form of servitude or I may say   slavery  that prevails in States       Mr  Vice President  Probably it is his idea with respect to this distinction between serfdom and servitude       The next three amendments are Nos  546  547 and 548  of which the most comprehensive is No  546  standing in the name of Prof  K  T  Shah       Prof  K  T  Shah  Bihar  General   Sir  I move        That in clause  1  of article 17  for the words Traffic in human beings and begar   the words  Traffic inhuman beings or their dedication in the name of religion to be Devadas is or be subject to other forms of enslavement and degradation and begar  be substituted        In commending this motion I should like to point out that by  Traffic in human beings   I understand the possibility of buying and selling as if these human beings were chattels  and as such ought to be prohibited  The common understanding interprets these words to mean slavery as it was practised in olden countries  and  until recent times  even in the so called civilized countries of Europe or America  It is but right that such traffic should be abolished       But the traffic in human beings is not confined only to what was known as slavery in recent times  It happens   and perhaps it happens on a much larger scale than innocent Members of this House may be aware  in what is known as White Slave traffic  namely  the buying and selling of young women for export or import  from one set of countries to another  and their permanent enslavement or servitude to an owner or proprietor of the establishments of Commercialised vice probably for life       This is covered no doubt by ordinary forms of legal contract  where the contracting parties are presumed to be free agents  How far such legal contracts are truly lawful if interpreted in the spirit of the law  I cannot say  But that these contracts offend very much against the common sense of all civilized humanity  I am prepared to assert       Accordingly  I would like it very clearly to be understood by this amendment that  traffic in human beings  does not consist only of buying and selling of what were formerly known as slaves  but also this new type of slavery which in effect is a very large scale commercialised vice that the so called civilized countries have popularised  or  may I say  have made an industry of       This may not perhaps have been in the minds of the draftsman of this clause  But I think the House would do well to bear it in mind  and to accept this amendment by which such a practice would be perfectly clearly and expressly prohibited       I have  no doubt  worded my amendment with reference to a particular form of slavery which prevails in this country to a large extent  namely  dedication  in the name of religion  of young women to be Devadasis  and as such devoted to immoral traffic almost from an immature age  This also I think ought to be stopped  The name or cloak of religion should not help all those who indulge in such traffic  and the Constitution should make no bones about prohibiting this  if I am right in reading the spirit of this article which would prohibit all kinds of traffic inhuman beings       Forced labour is no doubt an evil  and the peculiar form of it  which is known by the word  begar   that is to say of compulsory work without payment  and work at command  should also be stopped  But more than anything else  I would like by this amendment to emphasize this highly immoral  and  I was going to say  inhuman traffic  which prevail on a very large scale  much larger than perhaps the House realizes  and as such I commend this amendment to the House       Mr  Vice President  Amendment No  547       Shri B  Das  Orissa  General   Sir  I do not move but I wish to speak       Mr  Vice President  I cannot allow you to speak  Do you want that it should be put to the vote       Shri B  Das  No Sir  I do not move  Could you not allow me to say a word       Mr  Vice President  I cannot because that will create a general flutter in the House  You will have to take your chance       Mr  Vice President  Amendment No  548  Giani Gurmukh Singh Musafir  East Punjab  Sikh   Sir  my amendment reads        That in clause  1  of article 17  after the words  human beings  the words  including prostitution  be inserted        Mr  Vice President  Do you want to move it       Giani Gurmukh Singh Musafir    I merely want to say something       Mr  Vice President  I cannot say that every Member who has sent in an amendment would find time to speak  I must make this clear  because we have to hurry   Amendments 549  550 and 552 were not moved        Amendment No  551  This is a verbal amendment and therefore it is disallowed   Amendment 553 was not moved        Amendment No  554  This is a verbal amendment and therefore it is disallowed       Amendments Nos  555  558 and 560 are to be considered together  I can allow No  555 to be moved       Shri Jaspat Roy Kapoor  United Provinces  General   I am not moving amendment No  555       Sardar Bhopinder Singh Man  East Punjab  General   Mr  Vice President  Sir  I beg to move         That in clause  2  of article 17  after the words  caste or class  the words  and shall pay adequate compensation for it  be inserted        Sir  with the addition of my amendment clause  2  will read thus        Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from imposing compulsory service for public purposes and shall pay adequate compensation for it        Begar is a sort of forced work from labourers and we have sought to abolish it and prohibit it in the country  The idea is that the worker should not be made to work against his will  but however an exception is made that the State can impose compulsory service for public purposes  Now  supposing the State requires any property and deprives any citizen of it  there is the accepted principle that it shall pay compensation  adequate price  for it  Similarly  when the State deprives a worker of his lab our   and I believe his labour is his property for the labourer  then I want that the State should pay compensation for it       Shri H  V  Kamath   Mr  Vice President  Sir  I beg to move         That in clause  2  of article 17  for the word  public  the words  social or national be substituted        At the outset  may I just say that the non English word in this article  begar  has nowhere been defined and it will be better if we define it somewhere in the constitution  if not in this article itself  Now  coming to the amendment  to my mind the word  public  does not bring out the meaning or significance of the purport of clause  2  of this article as much as the word  social  or  national  will  We all know that the services of the State  Government services  are referred to as  public services   but  national service  or  social service  has got a wider and a higher  a more comprehensive connotation than the word  public service   I remember very well that during the proceedings of the National Planning Committee  which was brought into being by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and presided over by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and to which my friend Prof  K  T  Shah rendered yeoman service for a period of well over three or four years  in that report it was suggested that all citizens should be conscripted for some social service  and Pandit Nehru when speaking on this subject went to the length of saying that no student should be awarded his academic degree unless and until he puts in six months or a year of some kind of social service  The word used there was  social service   not  public service   The word  national  has got even a still higher connotation than the word  social   My friend Dr  Ambedkar yesterday referred to this type of national service  When there is a war  when there is an emergency  when the stability of the State is threatened  when there is an emergency  when the stability of the State is threatened  when there is an insurrection  then in particular the question of national service will arise and then also will arise  as he referred to yesterday  the duty of the citizens to bear arms  In these cases  I say there must be conscription  I do not mean for military service only but for some kind of service in the national cause  Even conscientious objectors must be asked to do some kind of service  though not necessarily to bear arms and go to the front line       Here  I would also suggest that not merely there should be no discrimination of religion  race  caste or class  but there should be no discrimination of sex either  In this connection  however I would like to sound a note of caution and that is  against the unqualified enforcement of the duty to bear arms  The duty to bear arms  to my mind  without the corresponding right to bear arms  is one of the characteristics of a totalitarian State  a police raj or a military dictatorship  and not of a democratic State which the Preamble says our future India is going to be  The enforcement of the duty to bear arms is only the outward expression of the idea or doctrine of  dying  for the State  We must die for the State  The expression of this doctrine is the duty to bear arms  But every citizen has a higher duty to perform  and that is to  live  for the State  live for the State  and not merely die for the State  and this doctrine of  live for the State  is connected with the right to bear arms       In the end I suggest that clause  2  of this article may be re worded  and for the word  public service  the words  social or national  should be substituted  I would have had no objection if they had said just  public service   but  service for public purposes  is hardly appropriate  and to my mind the significance and meaning of this clause would be better expressed if we say that  nothing in this article shall prevent the State from imposing compulsory service for social or national purposes   Sir  I move   Amendment No  557 was not moved        Prof  K  T  Shah   Mr  Vice President  Sir  I beg to move         That in clause  2  of article 17  after the words  discrimination on the ground  the word  only  be added        This  Sir  is a very small  but in my opinion  a very important amendment  If it is accepted the clause would read             in imposing such service the State shall not make discrimination on the ground only of race  religion caste or class        The significance of this is so clear that  even though I have moved it  I trust the Draftsmen will accept it       Mr  Vice President  The clause is now open for general discussion  Giani Gurmukh Singh will now speak  I give him five minutes       Giani Gurmukh Singh Musafir     Mr  Vice President  article 17 is a useful provision in the Constitution  but there are one or two short comings which should be removed  In this connection I had given notice of an amendment but I could not get an opportunity to speak on it  I would like to say that prostitution is not in accord with the Indian civilization       It was imported from the West and with the departure of Western rulers it must come to an end  In clause  1  of article 17  after the words  Traffic in human beings  the word  Prostitution  must be included  for then alone the dignity of this clause will be increased  and defect removed  Another suggestion has been moved by Sardar Bhopendra Singh Man  It is a very good suggestion that  if the Government imposes compulsory service in the public interest  then the workers must get adequate compensation  It is good to specify in clause  2  of this article that in imposing compulsory service no discrimination on the ground of race  religion  caste or class shall be made  The right of imposing compulsory service conceded to the Government by this clause  is more or less absolutely vested in them  Even now  the government officials through their influence impose compulsory service  If provision is made to pay compensation  then this defect will disappear and the usefulness of this clause will be enhanced  Hitherto the practice of  Begar  was a source of oppression to the poor  Now this clause would not fit in  if it is passed without providing for payment of compensation  I do not propose to say more  as the Vice President has already ruled  and therefore  without taking much of the  time of the House  I shall mention only two points  firstly that the curse of prostitution should go from this country and secondly  compensation must be paid for compulsory service         Shrimati G  Durgabai  Madras  General   Mr  Vice President  let me assure you that I will take up only one or two minutes of the valuable time of the Assembly  I want to say a few words on this article  There is the amendment of Professor Shah intended to substitute in clause  1   Traffic in human beings or their dedication in the name of religion to be Devadasis or be subject to other forms of enslavement and degradation as well as begar   for the words  Traffic in human beings and begar        Sir  if any province has suffered from this bad practice of dedication of devadas is in the name of religion  it is the province of Madras  The worst form of this custom existed in Madras for a long time  I do not know whether this custom of dedication exists in any other province in any form  But we all know that in several ways this was practised  But  I do not think  while appreciating the object of Professor Shah in bringing forward this amendment and while being thankful to him for having realised the necessity for removing this evil  that this amendment is necessary  Madras has already prohibited this practice under a law passed a few years ago  It is no more in vogue there  Though some relics of that system still exist  these  I am sure  will disappear in course of time  I should mention in this connection my appreciation of the efforts put in by reformers like Mrs  Muthulakshmi Reddi  It is mainly on account of her efforts that this evil is no more there  Our deep debt of gratitude is due to her for her efforts  As I said  Madras has passed a law prohibiting this custom  I do not therefore think it necessary to include this provision in article 13  although I very much appreciate the spirit which has actuated Professor Shah to move this amendment       Mr  Vice President  I now call upon Shri B  Das to speak  He is almost the father of the House and must set an example of brevity       Shri B  Das   Sir  on the previous occasion when we were discussing the Fundamental Principles I pointed out the need for including in the Draft Constitution the removal of this great social evil  the traffic in women  This traffic means use of force to compel women to life of prostitution  When we talk of traffic in women  which is a great social evil all over the world  I did dilate upon it last time and said that we should not be prudes and attempt to hide the fact that there existed this traffic in women in India  Sir  I bow to the decision elsewhere that I should not move my amendment which sought to add the words  particularly in women  after the words  Traffic in human beings        Sir  let us confess and admit that there is this traffic in women for which men every where are responsible  Women were often removed from Orissa  I pointed out that in the great Bengal disaster in 1943 44  lakhs of women were spirited away to the Punjab and North West Frontier Province  Sir  young women were taken away by the alien Government into the camps of soldiers and they were thus lost to humanity  lost to family  lost to us as good citizens  So  we mere men should not fight shy of this and feel that by including an amendment of this kind we will be confessing the existence of this traffic in women in this country  That is why I gave notice of the amendment  If the House is willing to accept Shrimati Durgabai s amendment or even the amendment of Professor Shah who has confined his amendment to the Devadasi system and has not thought of the influence of dances before temples which preserve our national art and music from time immemorial       Shri H  V  Kamath  Has Shrimati Durgabai given notice of any amendment to this article  Sir       Mr  Vice President  She has not       Shri B  Das  She has sent in one to Dr  Ambedkar       Mr  Vice President  I have no knowledge of it       Shri B  Das  I am sorry  I misunderstood  However  I think we will not be justifying our constitution on fundamental rights if we do not accept and admit our great sins by including the words  traffic in women  and try to save the situation now and hereafter       Shri Raj Bahadur  United State of Matsya   Mr  vice President  Sir  begar like slavery has a dark and dismal history behind it  As a man coming from an Indian State  I know what this begar  this extortion of forced lab our  has meant to the down trodden and dumb people of the Indian States  If the whole story of this begar is written  it will be replete  with human misery  human suffering  blood and tears  I know how some of the Princes have indulged in their pomp and luxury  in their reckless life  at the expense of the ordinary man  how they have used the down trodden labourers and dumb ignorant people for the sake of their pleasure  I know for instance how for duck shooting a very large number of people are roped in forcibly to stand all day long in mud and slush during cold chilly wintry days  I know how for the sake of their game and people have been roped in large numbers for beating the lion so that the Princes may shoot it  I have also seen how poor people are employed for domestic and other kinds of labour  no matter whether they are ailing or some members of their family are ill  These people are paid nothing or paid very little for the labour extorted from them  This is not the whole story  As I said in the beginning  it would make really a terrible reading if the whole story is told  I know that very often these tyrannies are perpetrated upon poor people by the petty officials  Not only do these petty officials perpetrate such tyrannies but they also extort bribes from the labourers who want to escape the curse of this begar  While making my observations on this article  I would like to say that I am opposed to the amendment which has been moved by Sardar Bhopindra Singh Man providing for compensation in case of compulsory labour on works for public purposes  because I feel that there is a possibility that  if this amendment is accepted  it may be misused and people might be forced against their will       Summing up  I may add that article 13 constitutes the charter of freedom for the common man  and this article is a sort of complement to that charter of freedom  This frees the poor  down trodden and dumb people of the Indian  States  I cannot say anything of other provinces  from this curse of begar  This begar has been a blot on humanity and has been a denial of all that has been good and noble in human civilisation  Through the centuries this curse has remained as a dead weight on the shoulders of the common manlike the practice of slavery  The members of the Drafting Committee and this Constituent Assembly are entitled to the grateful thanks of the dumb down  trodden millions who would be freed by this article from this curse of begar       Shrimati Renuka Ray  West Bengal  General   Mr  Vice President  Sir  I shall try to be as brief as possible       The awakened conscience of women in India and the world is fully alive to the problem of the traffic in women and cannot tolerate its continuance  Sir  if we do not accept the amendment of Mr  B  Das  it is not because we do not appreciate his purpose  We realise that he wishes to place particular emphasis on the problem of the traffic in women  but I do think that the article as it stands does cover it  I am merely pointing this out because it may be thought that the women members of this House are not alive to this problem  It is one of the most urgent of all problems on which women s organisations in this country  have of cussed their attention for some time past       As for the amendment that my honourable Friend  Mr  K  T  Shah  moved  I agree with Shrimati Durgabai that legislation has covered this problem in regard to Madras  but I think that if Mr  Shah s amendment could be accepted by this House so that the Devadasi system  the dedication of women in temples  is abolished by a categorical provision in the Constitution  it would be better procedure as the custom still lingers in some areas  Otherwise it is to be hoped that legislation abolishing the custom in other parts where it still exists will soon come in  I want to stress the fact that women are fully alive to the fact that it is the dual standards of morality that have led to traffic in women  It is when society realises fully the need for doing away with dual standards of morality that this article that is being adopted can really come into effect and become a reality and not merely a paper provision in the Constitution       Acts for the prevention of immoral traffic in women do exist already in this country but their operation is not effective and even if legal flaws are amended  these can only become really effective when men s minds change towards this problem  whereby a section of women are at the mercy of exploiters whereby the very dignity of womenhood is lowered       Mr  Vice President  Mr  Nagappa  please show that you deserve the confidence that the House has placed in you by limiting yourself to five minutes       Shri S  Nagappa  Madras  General   I will not take much time  Sir       This practice of begar is prevalent in my own part of the country  especially among the Harijans  I am glad that the Drafting Committee has inserted this clause to abolish begar  Sir  whenever cattle die  the owner of the cattle wants these poor Harijans to come and remove the dead cattle  remove the skins  tan them and make chappals and supply them free of cost  For this  what do they get  Some food during festival days  Often  Sir  this forced labour is practised even by the government  For instance  if there is any murder  after the postmortem  the police force these people to remove the dead body and look to the other funeral processes  I am glad that hereafter this sort of forced labour will have no place  Then  Sir  this is practised in zamindaries also  For instance  if there is a marriage in the zamindar s family  he will ask these poor people  especially the Harijans  to come and white wash his whole house  for which they will be given nothing except food for the day  This sort of forced labour is still prevalent in most ports of the presidency       Another thing that I want to bring to the notice of the course is that whenever the big zamindar s lands are to be ploughed  immediately he will send word for these poor people  the Harijans  the previous day  and say   All your services are confiscated for the whole of tomorrow  you will have to work throughout the day and night  No one should go to any other work   In return  the zamindar will give one morsel of food to these poor fellows  Sir  this sort of forced labour is in practice in the 20th century in our so called civilised country  I am very thankful to this Drafting Committee  I support this article       Shri T  T  Krishnamachari  Madras  General   Mr  Vice President  Sir  I am here primarily to oppose the amendment moved by my honourable Friend  Prof  K  T  Shah  in that it imports into the consideration of this article facts which ought not to be taken into account in a consideration of the fundamental rights that are to be incorporated in the Constitution       Sir  if the House would permit me a moment to deal with the general principles which are the basis of this particular Part  it is that we want to ensure certain amount of rights to the individual  so that he will be ennobled  We also want to bar legislation from creeping in into those rights  which it is absolutely necessary should be maintained intact so that the individual s status might be protected  There is no point in our trying to import into this particular Part reform of all the abuses  which our society is now heir to  If those abuses are such where vested interests are likely to seek perpetuation of those abuses  well  I think we have to provide against them  but if public opinion is sufficiently mobilised against those abuses  I do not think we ought to put a blot on the fair name of India  possibly  by enacting in our constitution a ban on such abuses  Abuses which will disappear in course of time cannot disappear all at once by our putting a ban on them in the constitution  Looking as I do at such matters in that light  I wish most a my honourable Friends in this House will not try to import into these fundamental rights age old peculiarities of ours that still persist  bad as they are in particular parts of society which can be made to disappear by suitable legislation in due course  perhaps in two  three or four years  My honourable Friend Shrimati Durgabai pointed out that this system of Devadasis obtaining in India has been abolished by legislation in Madras  There is nothing to bar other provinces from following suit and I think public opinion is sufficiently mobilised for all provinces undertaking legislation of that type  Why then put it into the fundamental rights  a thing which is vanishing tomorrow  I think the same principle might be adopted in the rest of the article that would come before the House in this particular part  namely  what we could achieve in the matter of social reform by normal legislation  we need not seek to put into the fundamental rights  but if it is a matter where the vested interests for purposes of economic gain want to perpetuate a particular anti social custom that obtains amongst us  well  I think  it is perfectly right that we should put it into the Fundamental Rights  I think some form of forced labour does exist in practically all parts of India  call it  begar  or anything like that and in my part of the country  the tenant often times is more or less a helot attached to the land and he has certain rights and those are contingent on his continuing to be a slave       We are trying to root it out  and by putting it in the fundamental rights it will hasten legislation to wipe out evils of that kind as it will then become an obligation of the State  I would only mention to the House that let us not seek to enlarge the scope of these articles by putting in evils which can be wiped out by legislation  on which public opinion is sufficiently mobilised  but only import into it such considerations against which vested interests might conceivably take a firm stand  Sir  I support the article that is being considered by the House       Shri Mahavir Tyagi  May I seek your permission  Mr  Vice President  I want to clear some doubts which arise in my mind in regard to this article       Mr  Vice President  I am sorry  it is too late       Shri Mahavir Tyagi  I must be told as to how I can catch your eye or draw your attention       Honourable Members  Order  order       Mr  Vice President  The House has pronounced its decision       Shri Mahavir Tyagi  Can any one  by handing over slips or by standing every time  catch your eye  Sir       Mr  Vice President  The House has pronounced its decision       Shri Mahavir Tyagi  What is the decision       Mr  Vice President  You ask the House       Shri Mahavir Tyagi  I feel it is very unfair       The Honourable Dr  B  R  Ambedkar   Mr  Vice President  I should like to state at the outset what amendments I am prepared to accept and what  I am afraid  I cannot accept  Of the amendments that have been moved  the only amendment which I am prepared to accept is the amendment by Prof  K  T  Shah  No  559  which introduces the word  only  in clause  2  of article 17 after the words  discrimination on the ground   The rest of the amendments  I am afraid  I cannot accept  With regard to the amendments which  as I said  I cannot accept one is by Prof  K  T  Shah introducing the word  devadasis   Now I understand that his arguments for including  devadasis  have been replied to by other members of the House who have taken part in this debate  and I do not think that any useful purpose will be served by my adding anything to the arguments that have already been urged       With regard to the amendment of my honourable Friend  Mr  H  V  Kamath  he wants the words  social and national  in place of the word  public   I should have thought that the word  public  was wide enough to cover both  national  as well as  social  and it is  therefore  unnecessary to use two words when the purpose can be served by one  and I think  he will agree that is the correct attitude to take       With regard to the amendment of my honourable Friend Shri Damodar Swarup Seth  it seems to be unnecessary and I  therefore  do not accept it  With regard to the amendment of Sardar Bhopinder Singh Man  he wants that wherever compulsory labour is imposed by the State under the provisions of clause  2  of article 17 a proviso should be put in that such compulsory service shall always be paid for by the State  Now  I do not think that it is desirable to put any such limitation upon the authority of the State requiring compulsory service  It may be perfectly possible that the compulsory service demanded by the State may be restricted to such hours that it may not debar the citizen who is subjected to the operation of this clause to find sufficient time to earn his livelihood  and if  for instance  such compulsory labour is restricted to what might be called  hours of leisure  or the hours  when  for instance  he is not otherwise occupied in earning his living  it would be perfectly justifiable for the State to say that it shall not pay any compensation       In this clause  it may be seen that non payment of compensation could not be a ground of attack  because the fundamental proposition enunciated in sub clause  2  is this  that whenever compulsory labour or compulsory service is demanded  it shall be demanded from all and if the State demands service from all and does not pay any  I do not think the State is committing any very great inequity  I feel  Sir  it is very desirable to leave the situation as fluid as it has been left in the article as it stands       Shri H  V  Kamath  On a point of information  Sir  is Dr  Ambedkar s objection to my amendment merely on the ground that it consists of two words in place of one  In that case  I shall be happy if the wording is either  social  or  national  in place of  public        The Honourable Dr  B  R  Ambedkar  It is better to use a wider phraseology which includes both       Shri Rohini Kumar Chaudhuri   Assam  General   May I know  Sir  does the honourable Member accept amendment No 548  which deals with prostitution  and which was moved by Giani Gurmukh Singh Musafir       The Honourable Dr  B  R  Ambedkar  I understand it was not moved       Mr  Vice President   It was not moved       I shall now put the amendments to vote one by one       Amendment No  544 standing in the name of Kazi Syed Karimuddin       The question is        That for article 17  the following be substituted          17  Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude such as begar except as a punishment for crime shall exist within the Union State        The amendment was negatived       Mr  Vice President  Amendment No  545 standing in the name of Shri Damodar Swarup Seth       The question is        That the following words be added at the beginning of clause  1  of article 17         Servitude and serfdom in all forms as well as   The amendment was negatived       Mr  Vice President  Amendment No  546 standing in the name of Professor K  T  Shah       The question is        That in clause  1  of article 17  for the words  Traffic in human beings and begar   the words  Traffic inhuman beings or their dedication in the name of religion to be Devadasis or be subject to other forms of enslavement and degradation as well as begar  be substituted        The amendment was adopted       Mr  Vice President  Amendment No  560 standing in the name of Sardar Bhopinder Singh Man       The question is        That in clause  2  of article 17  after the words  caste or class  the words  and shall pay adequate compensation for it  be inserted        Sardar Bhopinder Singh Man  Sir  I request the permission of the House to withdraw it       The amendment was  by leave of the Assembly  withdrawn       Mr  Vice President  Amendment No  556 standing in the name of Mr  Kamath       The question is        That in clause  2  of article 17  for the word  public  the words  social or national  be substituted   The amendment was negatived       Mr  Vice President  Amendment No  559 standing in the name of Professor K  T  Shah  accepted by Dr  Ambedkar       The question is        That in clause  2  of article 17  after the words  discrimination on the ground  the word  only  be added   The amendment was adopted       Mr  Vice President  I shall now put the article as a whole as modified by amendment No  559 to vote       The question is       That article 17 as modified by amendment No  559 form part of the Constitution  The motion was adopted       Article 17  as amended  was added to the Constitution  Article 18      Mr  Vice President   We now go to the next article       The motion is that Article 18 form part of the Constitution       The first amendment is No  561  This is negative and therefore  it is out of order       Amendments numbers 562 and 564  No  562 standing in the name of Professor Shibban Lal Saksena and 564 standing in the name of Shri Damodar Swarup Seth and others are of similar import and have therefore to be considered together  Amendment No  562 is allowed to be moved      Prof  Shibban Lal Saksena  United Provinces  General   Sir  I am not moving the amendment  but I would like to speak on the article       Mr  Vice President  Then  I will allow amendment No 564 to be moved       Shri Damodar Swarup Seth   Sir  I beg to move        That the following be added at the end of article 18         Nor shall women be employed at night  in mines or in industries detrimental to their health         Sir  it is a matter of great satisfaction that in article 18 protection has been afforded to children of minor age  But  unfortunately  for reasons not known to me  no protection has been provided for the fairer and softer sex  who had been in the past  employed in mines even at night time and in industries which are injurious to their health  I therefore think  Sir  that it is just and desirable that the addition suggested should be made in this article so that women may also be provided with due protection and may not be employed in mines at night and in industries which are not suited to their delicate health and position in society  I therefore hope that the House will accept this amendment of mine        Mr  Vice President  Then  comes amendment No  563        Amendments 563 and 565 were not moved        The article is open for general discussion       Prof  Shibban Lal Saksena   Sir  I am very glad that this article has been placed among fundamental rights  In fact  one of the complaints against this charter of liberty is that it does not provide for sufficient economic rights  If we examine the fundamental rights in the Constitutions of other countries  we will find that many of them are concerned with economic rights  In Russia particularly  the right to work is guaranteed  the right to rest and leisure  the right to maintenance in old age and sickness etc   are guaranteed  We have provided these things in our Directive Principles  although I think  properly  they should be in this Chapter  Even then  this article 18 is an economic right  that no child below the age of fourteen shall be employed in any factory  I feel  Sir  that the age should be raised to sixteen  In other countries also the age is higher  we want that in our country also this age should be increased  particularly on account of our climate  children are weak at this age and the age should be raised       So also  I want that women should not be employed in the night or after dusk and before dawn in the factories  In fact all the progressive countries in the world have forbidden female labour after dusk and before dawn  This question was debated at length during the discussion on the Factory Act in the Parliament  I think that this is a question of very fundamental importance and this should be laid down in the Fundamental Rights that the States shall not employ women after dusk or before dawn  Sir  if this important thing had been done  we would have been hailed by innumerable women workers in the country  especially as it is a question of employing women in mines and factories  You know there was a great furore in the country during the war when women were allowed to work in mines  and I personally think that this must be considered as something very important and I hope Dr  Ambedkar will see his way to include it       The Honourable Dr  B  R  Ambedkar   I do not accept the amendment moved by Mr  Damodar Swarup  No  564       Mr  Vice President  I put the amendment No  564 to vote       The question is        That the following be added at the end of article 18          Nor shall women be employed at night  in mines or in industries detrimental to health    The amendment was negatived       Mr  Vice President  Now I put the motion        The question is        That article 18 stand part of the Constitution   The motion was adopted  Article 18 was added to the Constitution  Article 18 A      Mr  Vice President   Now we come to a new article in the form of amendment No  566       Prof  K  T  Shah   Mr  Vice President  I beg to move        That the following new article be inserted under the heading  Rights relating to Religion  occurring after article 18     18 A  The State in India being secular shall have no concern with any religion  creed or profession of faith  and shall observe an attitude of absolute neutrality in all matters relating to the religion of any class of its citizens or other persons in the Union         This  Sir  ought not to be a controversial matter at all  We have proclaimed it time and again that the State in India is secular  and as such it should have no concern  I should think that would follow logically  with the affairs of any religion  with the profession of any particular faith  creed or belief       By this I do not wish to suggest that the neutrality of the State in matters of religion should mean the utter ignorance or neglect of institutions or services which may  in the name of religion or belief  be conducted by people professing a particular form of faith  All I wish to say is that with the actual profession of faith or belief  the State should have no concern  Nor should it  by any action of it  give any indication that it is partial to one or the other  All classes of citizens should have the same treatment in matters mundane from the State  And even those who may not be citizens of this State  by living within it  should receive the same treatment       The citizens of this Union obviously belong to all professions  a wide variety of faiths or religious beliefs  To take one or the other  or even to suggest that one or the other is favoured or assisted or aided by the State in its mundane affairs at any time  if I may put it so   would not be in the interest of the State  For it would give any other section of the people professing another belief  the impression that any particular section is preferred       If the State can  and I believe it can very easily  promote all mundane services  all worldly activities and utilities which are for the benefit of the community collectively  no matter by what section they are carried on  then  according to my amendment  there ought to be no objection  But if the State is associated in any way with the promotion of any particular form of profession or faith  then I think it would be highly objectionable for a secular organization to do so       Accordingly I am suggesting that  The State in India being secular shall have no concern with any religion  creed or profession of faith   I am again and again emphasising this aspect of religion because that is by its very essence  a non worldly activity  and as such the State which is  may I say it without any disrespect  essentially an earthly organization  should have no concern       One could dilate upon this matter for an indefinite period  I do not regard occasions of this kind  or debates of this nature to be opportunities for unconscious self revelation or deliberate professions of one s own attitude  I therefore will not take the time of the House in going further into this subject which I am sure would interest everybody sufficiently  at any rate  to consider favourably my amendment   Amendment No  567 was not moved        Mr  Vice President  No  568       Shri T  T  Krishnamachari  May I point out that this amendment relates to a matter more or less akin to 13 A which you were good enough to keep in abeyance for the time being       Mr  Vice President  Then it may stand over   Amendment No  569 was not moved        Mr  Vice President  I put amendment No  566 to vote       The question is          That the following new article be inserted under the heading  Rights relating to Religion  occurring after article 18   18 A  The State in India being secular shall have no concern with any religion  creed or profession of faith  and shall observe an attitude of absolute neutrality in all matters relating to the religion of any class of its citizens or other persons in the Union    The amendment was negatived   Article 14  Contd        Mr  Vice President   We shall go back to Article 14  So far as I remember   I am sorry I have mislaid my notes  in article 14 there were a number of amendments which were put to the vote one after the other  and that only two amendments were being considered  when  for reasons already known to the House  we postponed their consideration  One was amendment No  512 moved by Kazi Syed Karimuddin  and the other was a suggestion  am I right in saying that it was a suggestion made by Mr  T  T  Krishnamachari  Mr  T  T  Krishnamachari  will you please enlighten me  Was it a suggestion or was it a short notice amendment       Shri T  T  Krishnamachari  It was a short notice amendment       Mr  Vice President  It was a short notice amendment admitted by me  These two only remained to be put to the vote       Mr  Naziruddin Ahmad   With regard to amendment No  512I have a point of order  Mr  Vice President       You will be pleased to remember  Sir  that amendment No  512 was moved in the House  It was accepted by Dr  Ambedkar and then it was put to the vote  The shouts according to your estimate were in favour of its acceptance  Then some trouble arose and then shouts were again called  The shouts according to your estimate were again in favour of the amendment  What is very important in this connection  Sir  is that you declared the amendment to be carried       Mr  Vice President  Did I declare the amendment to be carried       Mr  Naziruddin Ahmad  Yes  Sir  I remember       Mr  Vice President  Do the records show that       Mr  Naziruddin Ahmad  The shorthand notes may be referred to  My recollection is it was declared carried  Interruption        Mr  Vice President  Kindly  in order to preserve the diginity of the House  do not interrupt Mr  Naziruddin Ahmad only because he is putting forward a point of view which may not be agreeable to a certain section of the House        To Mr  Naziruddin Ahmed  Kindly confine your remarks to the business on hand       Mr  Naziruddin Ahmad  Sir  I do not wish to obstruct the majority in dealing with this amendment in any way they please  I simply suggest that if it is carried  it cannot be put again  It is against the Rules  But I have a way out  which I shall suggest and which will be constitutional  There is a rule  in our Rules  that with the consent of twenty five per cent of the Members of the House  any resolution that has been carried may be re opened  I suggest  Sir  that if I am right that it was declared to be carried  then  it should be re opened in the regular constitutional manner       Mr  Vice President  The official records of the deliberations read this way        Just before the voting was called  however  Shri Mahavir Tyagi made a suggestion  which was later supported by the Prime Minister  that the voting on this particular amendment be postponed as there appeared to be some confusion as to the full implications of this provision  The House agreed to the suggestion and voting on this amendment and on the article as a whole was accordingly postponed        That shows that your whole objection falls to the ground        Mr  Naziruddin Ahmad rose to speak        Please do not argue       I want to make certain other things clear to the House  I want to make clear the point of view from which I regard this  As I have said already  the House is the ultimate authority in this as in all matters  The House has laid down certain Rules for the conduct of the business  These Rules have been laid down mainly because the aim of the House is that the work should proceed smoothly  The smooth working of the House I regard as the really essential thing  and much more important than sticking to the Rules which the House has made and which the House can un make at any time  When there was this confusion  to use the language of Mr  Naziruddin Ahmad  I made a reference to the House and the House agreed that the matter should be reconsidered  The House is fully competent to do so and if the House is still of that view  then the matter will be considered here and now       Maulana Hasrat Mohani   United Provinces  Muslim   May I know  Sir  whether the House has reconsidered or whether it is a mandate from the Congress Party who has issued a whip that it should be opposed  Do you decide to allow the House to reconsider or is it only a mandate from the Congress Party  I have got a copy of that whip in my hand  that this must be opposed       Shri Mahavir Tyagi   United Provinces  General   Sir  I protest against the language used and the honourable Member s referring to the whip of the Congress Party       Mr  Vice President  You have done your duty as a Congress man  now I shall do my duty as the presiding officer here       Maulana Hasrat Mohani  Sir  I stick to what I have said       Mr  Vice President  I am sorry                           Shri Mahavir Tyagi  Will you please ask him to give back the whip  which the honourable Member has no right to handle       Mr  Vice President  You are always the stormy petrel  While I am trying to bring peace and good humour you are interfering  I will not allow you to do so again       As I was saying  I am very sorry that an old and experienced public man like Maulana Hasrat Mohani should have permitted himself to make references to things which are no concern of this House  As I have said more than once  though I belong to a particular political party  so long as I am in the Chair  I recognise no party at all  It is in that spirit that proceedings of this House are being conducted  I regret very much that anything should have been said challenging the way in which the proceedings have been conducted or are going to be conducted       I ask the permission of the House once again as to whether I can re open the matter       Honourable Members  Yes       Mr  Vice President  Thank you  I am going to put amendment No  512 to the vote       The Honourable Shri Ghanshyam Singh Gupta   Sir  there is no question of re opening  You had not finally said that the amendment was carried or was not carried  I want to impress upon the House that the Chair had not declared that it was either carried or it was not carried and therefore there is no question of re opening at all  The matter is absolutely in the discretion of the Chair now  The Rules are quite clear  A vote is taken  Once it is challenged  the division bell rings  After the division bell rings  the Chair again puts it to the vote and then sends Ayes and Noes to the lobbies  The Teller counts the votes and after that  it is declared that a certain motion is lost or is carried  This was not done at all  In fact  it was in the process of declaration by the Chair that the motion is or is not carried that the Chair was pleased to say that this thing stands over  Anybody who says that the Chair finally declared that that motion was carried or lost is wrong       Mr  Vice President  It merely shows the depth of my ignorance  I used the word which should not have been used  I used the word  reopen   I am glad that the matter has been set right  I only wish that I had sufficient  what shall I say  ability to act in the way in which the Honourable Mr  Gupta has done  I now put amendment No  512 to vote       The question is        That in article 14  the following be added as clause 4            4  The right of the people to be secure in their persons  houses  papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized   The amendment was negatived       Mr  Vice President  We come to Mr  Krishnamachari s amendment which was accepted by Dr  Ambedkar       Shri H  V  Kamath  Is it necessary to say that Dr  Ambedkar has accepted or rejected every time       Mr  Vice President  Sometimes it is necessary  Not always  I now put the amendment to vote       The question is        That in clause 2 of article 14 after the word  shall be  the words  prosecuted and  be inserted   The amendment was adopted       Mr  Vice President  Now the question is        That article 14  as amended  stand part of the Constitution   The motion was adopted       Article 14  as amended was added to the Constitution  Article 15      Mr  Vice President   Now the motion before the House is  that article 15 form part of the Constitution       We shall go over the amendments one after another  515 is ruled out of order  Nos  516  517  518 and 532 are similar and of these I can allow 516 to be moved as also 517 both standing in the name of Shri Brajeshwar Prasad       Shri Brajeshwar Prasad   Bihar  General   Sir  I am not moving 516 and 517   Amendments Nos  518  532  519 and 520 were not moved        Mr  Vice President  No  521 is blocked  Then 522  523 524  525  528 and 530 are similar  I can allow 523 to be moved       Kazi Syed Karimuddin  C  P    Berar  Muslim   Mr  Vice President  Sir  if the proposed amendment by the Drafting Committee is accepted and the article is allowed to stand as it is         No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law                then in my opinion  it will open a sad chapter in the history of constitutional law  Sir  the Advisory Committee on Fundamental Rights appointed by the Constituent Assembly had suggested that no person shall be deprived of his life or liberty without due process of law  and I really do not understand how the words  personal  and  according to procedure established by law  have been brought into article 15 by the Drafting Committee       Shri Lakshmi Kanta Maitra  Sir  is the honourable Member moving his amendment or not       Mr  Vice President  In order to meet the requirements of technicalities  please move your amendment first       Kazi Syed Karimuddin  Sir  I beg to move        That in article 15  for the words  No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law  the words  No person shall be deprived of his life or liberty without due process of law  be substituted       Continuing my arguments Sir  if the words  according to procedure established by law  are enacted  there will be very great injustice to the law courts in the country  because as soon as a procedure according to law is complied with by a court  there will be an end to the duties of the court and if the court is satisfied that the procedure has been complied with  then the judges cannot interfere with any law which might have been capricious  unjust or iniquitous  The clause  as it stands  can do great mischief in a country which is the storm centre of political parties and where discipline is unknown  Sir  let us guarantee to individuals inalienable rights in such a way that the political parties that come into power cannot extend their jurisdiction in curtailing and invading the Fundamental rights laid down in this Constitution       Sir  there is an instance in the American Constitutional law in a case reported  Chambers Vs  Florida where an act was challenged in a court of law on the ground that the law was not sound and that it was capricious and unjust  Therefore  my submission is that if the words  according to procedure established by law  are kept then it will not be open to the courts to look into the injustice of a law or into a capricious provision in a law  As soon as the procedure is complied with  there will be an end to everything and the judges will be only spectators  Therefore  my submission is  first  that the words   except according to procedure established by law  be deleted  and then that the words  without due process of law  be inserted       Sir  actually I had sent two amendments  one about the word  personal  before the words  liberty   and the other about substitution of the words  without due process of law  for the words  except according to procedure established by law   But somehow or other  these two amendments have been consolidated  and I am required to move one amendment  Even if my amendment about  personal liberty  is not accepted by the Drafting Committee or Dr  Ambedkar  I do not mind  but the second portion of my amendment should be accepted   Amendment No  524 was not moved        Mr  Vice President  Amendment No  525  Mr  Naziruddin Ahmad  Do you want to press it       Mr  Naziruddin Ahmad  Sir  there is a printing mistake which I want to point out       Mr  Vice President  All right  Then we come to No  528 standing in the names of Shri Upendranath Barman  Shri Damodar Swarup Seth and Shri S  V  Krishnamurthy Rao       Kazi Syed Karimuddin  Sir  I have to raise a point of order here  I said in my speech that I have tabled two separate amendments  one regarding the word  personal  and the other regarding  due process of law   Both these amendments have been consolidated by mistake of the Secretariat  So I have had to move the second part of my amendment  But then  according to the list supplied to us  No  528 has been bracketted with No  523 that is my amendment  I have moved mine  and so No  528 cannot be moved now  but only put to vote  according to the practice followed in this House       Mr  Vice President  All right  We need not move No 528       Shri S  V  Krishnamurthy Rao  My sore   But there is a difference  in that in No  528 there is no reference to the word  personal   whereas No  523 refers to deletion of this word       Mr  Vice President  But they are of similar import and I have already given my decision  We shall put No  528 to vote       Then No  530 in the name of Mr  Z  H  Lari  Do you want it to be put to the vote       Mr  Z  H  Lari   United Provinces  Muslim   Yes  Sir       Mr  Vice President  Then in my list come No  524  second part  No  526 and No  527  These are almost the same  No  526 may be moved       Mahboob Ali Baig Sahib Bahadur  Madras  General   Sir  I beg to move        That in article 15 for the words  except according to procedure established by law  the words   save in accordance with law  be substituted        In the note given by the Drafting Committee  it is stated that they made two changes from the proposition or article passed by this Assembly in the month of August  April or May of 1947  The first is the insertion of the word  personal  before liberty  and the reason given is that unless this word  personal  finds a place there  the clause may be construed very widely so as to include even the freedoms already dealt with in article 13       That is the reason given for the addition of the word  personal   As regards why the original words  without due process of law  were omitted and the present words  except according to procedure established by law  are inserted  the reason is stated to be that the expression is more definite and such a provision finds place in article 31 of the Japanese Constitution of 1946  I will try to confine myself to the second change       It is no doubt true that in the Japanese Constitution article 31 reads like this but if the other articles that find place in the Japanese Constitution  viz   articles 32  34 and 35  had also been incorporated in this Draft Constitution that would have been a complete safe guarding of the personal liberty of the citizen  This Draft Constitution has conveniently omitted those provisions       Article 32 of the Japanese Constitution provides that  no person shall be denied the right of access to the court   According to the present expression it may be argued that the legislature might pass a law that a person will have no right to go to a court of law to establish his innocence  But according to the Japanese Constitution article 32 clearly says that  no person shall be denied the right of access to the court   Is there such a corresponding provision in this Draft Constitution  That is the question  It does not find any place at all       Article 34 of the Japanese Constitution provides that  no person shall be arrested or detained without being at once informed of the charges against him or without the immediate privilege of counsel  nor shall be detained without adequate cause and upon demand of any such person such cause should be immediately shown in open court in his presence and in the presence of his counsel   Such a clear right has not been given in these draft provisions       Further  article 35 provides that the right of all persons to be secured in their homes and against entry  searches  etc  shall not be impaired  except upon warrant issued only for probable cause and so on  If for the sake of clarity and definiteness you have imported into this Draft Constitution article 31 of the Japanese Constitution you should in fairness have incorporated the other articles of the Japanese Constitution  which are relevant and which were enacted for safeguarding the personal liberty of the honest citizen  May I ask the Drafting Committee through its Chairman whether it is clear from this constitution that a man who has been arrested and detained has got the right to resort to a court and prove his innocence  It may be said that the expression  except according to procedure established by law  covers the point but the expression means  procedure established by law  of the legislature and it will competent for the legislature to lay down a provision that in the matter of detention of persons whether for political or other reasons  the jurisdiction of the courts is ousted  We know the decisions of the High Courts of India  especially of Madras and some other High Courts  where it has been laid down by these courts that it is open to the legislature to say that the courts shall not interfere with the action taken by the Government in the case of certain citizens whom they consider to be committing an offence or about to commit an offence or are likely to commit an offence  It is not open to the court to go into the merits or demerits of the grounds on which a person has been detained  The only extent to which the courts can go is to find out whether there is bona fides or mala fides for the action of the Government  and the burden is laid upon the person to prove that there is mala fides on the part of the Government in having issued a warrant of detention or arrest  Therefore the words  except according to procedure aid down by law  would mean  and according to me it does mean  that the future legislature might pass a law by which the right of a citizen to be tried by a court to establish his innocence could betaken away  I do not by this mean to convey that under certain circumstances it may not be necessary for Government to prevent a persons from committing an offence and to take the precaution of arresting him and thus prevent him from committing an offence  But I submit that there must be the right of the citizen to go to a court to prove that the ground on which he has been arrested is wrong and he is innocent  That is the elementary right of the citizen as against the executive which might be clothed with power by a party legislature which might pass a law saying that the executive is empowered to take away the liberty of a person under certain circumstances and he will have no right to go to court and prove his innocence  If the framers of the Draft Constitution are able to tell us that these words  except according to procedure established by law  do not deprive a person of his right to go before the court and establish his innocence and he is not prevented from such a course  then it will be another matter  But we must understand that the words  without due process of law  have been held in England and other countries to convey the meaning that every citizen has got the right  when an action has been taken against him depriving him of his personal liberty  to go before the court and say that he is innocent  That right is given under the expression  without due process of law  or  save in accordance with law   In England the law of the land does not deprive a man of this fundamental and elementary right  All laws that may be made are subject to the relevant principle that no man shall be convicted and no man shall be deprived of his liberty without a chance being given to him to prove that he is innocent  Therefore it must be a law  as I have submitted  which will hear him before it condemns a man       The only reason which has been advanced in the footnote is that this is more definite and that it finds a place in the Japanese Constitution  As I have already stated  let us not sacrifice the liberty of the subject to prove his innocence  by resorting to the provisions of the Japanese Act and not complete that right of the citizen to be tried that liberty by omitting the other provisions of the Japanese Act  I shall be satisfied if all the provisions of the Japanese Constitution find a place here  because the other provisions clearly state that no person can be deprived of his liberty without his being given the chance to go to court and all assistance given to him  I therefore object to the words  except according to procedure established by law   If by any other method which may be said to be definite provision they can ensure that the citizen cannot be condemned without being heard by a court  I shall be satisfied  That is my reason for moving this amendment       Mr  Vice President  Amendments Nos  529 and 531 are disallowed as verbal amendments   Amendment No  533 was not moved        We can now proceed with the general discussion on article 15       Pandit Thakur Dass Bhargava  East Punjab  General   Sir  I sent an amendment No  525  which I wanted to amend by amendment No  9 on List No  1  Third week   This and amendment No  528 are the same  The amendment which has been moved by Mr  Karimuddin differs from these in so far as that the word  personal  before the word  liberty  does not appear in his amendment  I am opposed to the amendment of Mr  Karimuddin  The section as it is  with this amendment namely the substitution of the words  without due process of law  for the words  except according to procedure established by law  is the one which I wish to support       In this connection the first question that arises is what is the meaning of the word  law   According to the general connotation of the word  so widely accepted and the connotation which has been given to this word by Austin  law means an Act enacted by the legislatures whereas I submit that when Dicey used his words  law of the land  he meant law in another meaning        Similarly  when the Japanese Constitution and other Constitutions used this word in the broad sense they meant to convey by the word  law  universal principles of justice etc       According to the present section procedure is held sacrosanct whereas the word  law  really connotes both procedural law as well as substantive law  I have used the word  law  in the general sense  Though these words  without due process of law  which are sought to be substituted for the words in the section have not been defined anywhere  their meanings and implications should be understood fully  By using these words  without due process of law  we want that the courts may be authorised to go into the question of the substantive law as well as procedural law  When an enactment is enacted  according to the amendment now proposed to be passed by this House  the courts will have the right to go into the question whether a particular law enacted by parliament is just or not  whether it is good or not  whether as a matter of fact it protects the liberties of the people or not  If the Supreme Court comes to the conclusion that it is unconstitutional  that the law is unreasonable or unjust  then in that case the courts will hold the law to be such and that law will not have any further effect       As regards procedure also  if any legislature takes it into its head to divest itself of the ordinary rights of having a good procedural law in this country  to that extent the court will be entitled to say whether the procedure is just or not  This is within the meaning of the word  law  as it is used in this amendment and as it is generally used  The word  law  has also not been defined in this Constitution  For the purpose of article 8 the word  law  has been defined  Otherwise it has not been defined  I would therefore submit that if the words as used in the section remained  namely  procedure established by law   we will have to find out what is the meaning of the word  law   These words would remain vague and it will result in misconceptions and misconstructions  Therefore  unless and until we understand the meaning of  due process of law  we will not be doing justice to the amendment proposed  I therefore want to suggest that the words  due process of law  without being defined convey to us a sense as used in the American law as opposed to other laws  What will be the effect of this change  To illustrate this I would refer the House to Act XIV of 1908 called the Black Law under which thousands  if not hundreds of thousands of Congressmen were sent to jail  According to Act XIV of 1908 the Government took to themselves the powers of declaring any  organisation illegal by the mere fact that they passed a notification to that effect  This Act  when passed  was condemned by the whole of India  But the Government of the day enacted it in the teeth of full opposition  When the non co operation movement began it was civil disobedience of this law with which the Congress fought its battle  The Courts could not hold that the notification of the Government was wrong  The courts were not competent to hold that any organisation or association of persons was legal though its objects were legal  The objects of the Congress were peaceful  They wanted to attain self government but by peaceful and legitimate means  All the same  since the Government had notified  the courts were helpless  This legislation demonstrates the need of the powers of  due process        Similarly I will give another illustration  and that is Section 26 of the Defence of India Act  We know that the Federal Court held this Section to be illegal and a new Ordinance had to be issued  Unless and until therefore you invest the court with such power and make this Section 15 really justifiable there is no guarantee that we will enjoy the freedoms that the Constitution wants to confer upon us       The House has already accepted the word  reasonable  in article 13  At least 70 per cent of the Acts which can evolve personal liberty have now come under the jurisdiction of the courts  and the courts are competent to pronounce an opinion on such laws  whether they are reasonable or not  The House is now stopped from adopting another principle  In regard to personal property and life the question is much more important  So far as the question of life and personal liberty are concerned they must be also under the category of subjects which are within the jurisdiction of the courts       Therefore it is quite necessary that the House should accept this amendment  There are two ways  as suggested by the previous speakers  either you must put all the sections as in the Japanese Constitution  and we should pass many of the amendments tabled by Messrs  Lari and Karimuddin one of which you were pleased to declare carried in the first instance and which was later declared lost  They seek to introduce into the Constitution principles which the legislature will in future be unable to contravene  All those amendments regarding Fundamental Rights will be carried ipso facto if this one amendment of  due process  is accepted  Another thing which will be achieved by the acceptance of this one amendment is a recognition in this Constitution of the real genius of the people  In the old days we have heard of seven or eight Rishis  all very pious and intelligent people  holding real power in the land  To them  well versed in the Shastras  the ministers and the ancient kings went for advice  Those Rishis controlled the whole field of administration  This old ideal will practically be achieved if the full bench of the Supreme Court Judges well versed in law and procedure and possessing concentrated wisdom had the final say in regard to peoples  rights       Mr  Vice President  The honourable Member s time is up       Pandit Thakur Dass Bhargava  I have to say many things more  Sir  I know the argument against this amendment is that these words  due process of law  are not certain or clear  But may I know what is the exact meaning of the word  morality  put in this Constitution       Mr  Vice President  I ask the indulgence of the honourable Member  I intimated to him twice that he has exhausted his time  I have half a dozen notes from people competent to speak on this point  I am quite certain that it is not the wish of the honourable Member to curtail the time which I can allow them       Pandit Thakur Dass Bhargava  I do not want to curtail the time of the others       Mr  Vice President  Then you may have two minutes more       Pandit Thakur Dass Bhargava  Thank you  Sir       Shri Upendranath Barman   West Bengal  General   May I say a few words at this stage  Sir       Mr  Vice President  I am sorry I cannot oblige the honourable Member       Pandit Thakur Dass Bhargava  As I was saying  Sir  many other words used in this Constitution have an uncertain meaning  The words  decency  and  morality  have not got a definite meaning       Then  Sir  it is said this will tend to weaken the administration by the uncertainties which will be imported if this amendment is carried  But  Sir  our liberties will be certain through the particular law which may be reviewed by the court may become uncertain  The administration will not be weakened thereby  I grant that it may probably be that the administration will not have its way  But we want to have a Government which will respect the liberties of the citizens of India  As a matter of fact  if this amendment is carried  it will constitute the bed rock of our liberties  This will be a Magna Carta along with article 13 with the word  reasonable  in it  This is only victory for the judiciary over the autocracy of the legislature  In fact we want two bulwarks for our liberties  One is the Legislature and the other is the judiciary  But even if the legislature is carried away by party spirit and is sometimes panicky the judiciary will save us from the tyranny of the legislature and the executive       In a democracy  the courts are the ultimate refuge of the citizens for the vindication of their rights and liberties  I want the judiciary to be exalted to its right position of palladium of justice and the people to be secure in their rights and liberties under its protecting wings       I commend my amendment and beg the House to pass it       Shri Chimanlal Chakkubhai Shah  United States of Kathiawar  Saurashtra    Mr  Vice President  Sir  the right conferred by article 15 is the most fundamental of the Fundamental Rights in this Chapter  because it is the right which relates to life and personal liberty without which all other rights will be meaningless  Therefore  it is necessary that in defining this right  we must make it clear and explicit as to what it is that we want to confer and not put in restrictions upon the exercise of that right which make it useless or nugatory  I therefore support the amendment which says that the words  without due process of law  should be substituted for the words  except in accordance with the procedure established by law   Sir  the words  without due process of law  have been taken from the American Constitution and they have come to acquire a particular connotation  That connotation is that in reviewing legislation  the court will have the power to see not only that the procedure is followed  namely  that the warrant is in accordance with law or that the signature and the seal are there  but it has also the power to see that the substantive provisions of law are fair and just and not unreasonable or oppressive or capricious or arbitrary  That means that the judiciary is given power to review legislation  In America that kind of power which has been given to the judiciary undoubtedly led to an amount of conservative outlook on the part of the judiciary and to uncertainly in legislation  But our article is in two respects entirely different from the article in the American Constitution  In the American Constitution  the words are used in connection with life  liberty and property  In this article we have omitted the word  property   because on account of the use of this word in the American Constitution  there has been a good deal of litigation and uncertainty  There has been practically no litigation and no uncertainty as regards the interpretation of the words  due process of law  as applied to  life  and  liberty        Secondly  Sir  in the word  liberty  that we have used  we have added the word  personal  and made it  personal liberty  to make it clear that this article does not refer to any kind of liberty of contract or anything of that kind  but relates only to life and liberty of person  Therefore  it would be wrong to say that the words  due process of law  are likely to lead to any uncertainty in legislation or unnecessary interference by the judiciary in reviewing legislation       Sir  in all Federal Constitutions  the judiciary has undoubtedly the power which at times allows it to review legislation  This is inherent in all Federal Constitutions  In England  for example  the judiciary can never say that a law passed by Parliament is unconstitutional  All it can do is to interpret it  But in Federal Constitutions the judiciary has the power to say that a law is unconstitutional  In several articles of this Constitution  we have ourselves provided for this and given express powers to the judiciary to pronounce any law to be unconstitutional or beyond the powers of the legislature  I have no doubt in my mind that this is a very salutary check on the arbitrary exercise of any power by the executive       Sir  at times it does happen that the executive requires extraordinary powers to deal with extraordinary situations and they can pass emergency laws  The legislature  which is generally controlled by the executive because it is the majority that forms the executive gives such powers to the executive in moments of emergency  Therefore  it is but proper that we should give the right to the judiciary to review legislation       It may be said that the judiciary may  in times of crisis  not be able to appreciate fully the necessities which have required such kind of legislation  But I have no such apprehension  I have no doubt that the judiciary will take into account fully the necessities of a situation which have required the legislature to pass such a law  But it has happened at times that the law is so comprehensive that the individual is deprived of life and liberty without any opportunity of defence  What is the worst that can happen in an article like this if we put in the words  without due process of law   Some man may escape death or jail if the judiciary takes the view that the law is oppressive  Sir  is it not better that nine guilty men may escape than one innocent man suffers  That is the worst that can happen even if the judiciary takes a wrong view       But  in these days  the executive is naturally anxious to have more and more powers and it gets them  And we have developed a kind of legislation which is called delegated legislation in which the powers are given to subordinate officers to issue warrants and the like  For example  under the Public Safety Measures Acts  if a Commissioner of Police is satisfied that a particular man is acting against the interests of the State or is dangerous to public security  he could detain the man without trial       We know it to our cost that even the Commissioner of Police does not look into these matters personally as he is expected to do and signs or issues warrants on the reports of subordinate officials  It is better under such circumstances that there is some checkup on the exercise of such powers if they are arbitrarily used  I therefore fully support the amendment which seeks to substitute the words  without due process of law  in place of the words which have been used in the Article  As Mr  Mahboob Ali Baig has rightly pointed out  these words are taken from the Japanese Constitution but the Drafting Committee has omitted the other provisions which give meaning to these words  Mr  Baig s amendment which seeks to substitute the words  save in accordance with law   I am afraid  will not serve his own purpose  If he has in mind that the full import of all the provisions of the Japanese Constitution read along with the one which the Drafting Committee has put in  should be brought out here  it is better that he accepts the words   without due process of law   rather than the words  save in accordance with law  which are taken from the Irish Constitution and which probably have the same meaning as the words put in by the Drafting Committee  I therefore fully support amendment No 528  Shri Krishna Chandra Sharma  United Provinces  General   Mr  Vice President  Sir  my amendment No  523 sought the substitution of the words  without due process of law  for the words  except according to procedure established by law   This article guarantees the personal liberty and life of the citizen  In democratic life  liberty is guaranteed through law  Democracy means nothing except that instead of the rule by an individual  whether a king or a despot  or a multitude  we will have the rule of the law  Sir  the term  without due process of law  has a necessary limitation on the powers of the State  both executive and legislative  The doctrine implied by  without due process of law  has a long history in Anglo American law  It does not lay down a specific rule of but it implies a fundamental principle of justice  These words have nowhere been defined either in the English Constitution or in the American Constitution but we can find their meaning through reading the various antecedents of this expression  As a matter of fact  it can be traced back to the days of King John when the barons wrung their charter from him  i e   the Magna Carta  The expression  Per Legum Terrea  in the Magna Carta have come to mean  without due process of law   Chapter 39 of the Charter says         No free man shall be taken  or imprisoned  diseased  or outlawed  exiled  or in any way destroyed  nor shall we go upon him  nor send upon him  but by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land        These words were used again in 1331  1351 and 1355  Statute No  28 during the reign of Edward III says         No man of what state or condition so ever he be  shall be put out of his lands or tenements  nor taken  nor imprisoned  nor indicated  nor put to death  without he be brought to answer by due process of law        Sir  in the American Constitution  these words were first used in 1791         Nor shall any person           be deprived of life  liberty or property  without due process of law        What this phrase means is to guarantee a fair trial both in procedure as well as in substance  The procedure should be in accordance with law and should be appealable to the civilised conscience of the community  It also ensures a fair trial in substance  that is to say  that substantive law itself should be just and appealable to the civilised conscience of the community  Sir  various decisions of the American Supreme Court  when analysed  will stress the four fundamental principles that a fair trial must be given  second  the court or agency which takes jurisdiction in the case must be duly authorised by law to such prerogative  third that the defendant must be allowed an opportunity to present his side of the case and fourth that certain assistance including counsel and the confronting of witnesses must be extended  These four fundamental points guarantee a fair trail in substance       As to social progress  my Friend Pandit Bhargava has already spoken and I need not repeat the argument here  but for your enlightenment I would like to read a judgment which clarifies the position  The judgment runs  from Willoughby on the Constitution of the United States  p 1692         Thus  for example  in 1875  in Loan Association v  Topeka the Court said        It must be conceded that there are such rights in every free government beyond the control of the state  a government which recognised no such rights  which held the lives  the liberty and the property of its citizens subject at all times to the absolute disposition and unlimited control of even the most democratic depository of power is  after all  a despotism       The theory of our governments  state or municipal  is opposed to the deposit of unlimited power anywhere  The executive  the legislative and the judicial branches of these governments are all of limited and defined powers  There are limitations on such power which grow out of the essential nature of all free governments implied reservations of individual rights  without which the social compact could not exist  and which are respected by all governments entitled to the name  No court  for instance  would hesitate to declare void a statute which enacted that A and B who were husband and wife to each other should be so no longer  but that A should thereafter be the husband of C  and B the wife of D  or which should enact that the home stead now owned by A should henceforth be the property of B        Sir  with these words I support the amendment      Shri H  V  Pataskar  Bombay  General   Mr  Vice President  I have come forward only to take a few minutes of the House for supporting the amendment No  528 which wants to substitute  except according to procedure established by law  by the words  without due process of law   Already the legal aspect of this matter has been discussed at length in this House  but I want to place it before the House from another point of view  We are  Sir  at the present moment in a state which is going to be a democracy  Now  democracy implies party Government and party Government  in our country  is rather new and we have instances which lead us to think that the party machine at work is likely to prescribe procedures which are going to lead to the nullification of the provisions which we have made in the Fundamental Rights  which are being given to the people  We know from experience that in certain provinces there are already legislations which have been enacted and which prescribe certain procedures for detention  which have come in for criticism by the public in a very vehement manner  I therefore  submit  Sir  that it is very essential from the point of view of the right of personal liberty  that the words  due process of law  should be particularly there  With these words  Sir  I support the amendment and would not like to repeat what has been said in favour of this amendment already       Shri K  M  Munshi   Mr  Vice President  Sir  I want to support amendment No  528 which seeks to incorporate the words  without due process of law  in substitution of the words  except according to procedure established by law   In my humble opinion  if the clause stood as it is  it would have no meaning at all  because if the procedure prescribed by law were not followed by the courts  there would be the appeal court in every case  to set things right  This clause would only have meaning if the courts could examine not merely that the conviction has been according to law or according to proper procedure  but that the procedure as well as the substantive part of the law are such as would be proper and justified by the circumstances of the case  We want to set up a democracy  the House has said it over and over again  and the essence of democracy is that a balance must be struck between individual liberty on the one hand and social control on the other  We must not forget that the majority in a legislature is more anxious to establish social control than to serve individual liberty  Some scheme therefore must be devised to adjust the needs of individual liberty and the demands of social control  Eminent American constitutional lawyers are agreed on the point that no better scheme could have been evolved to strike a balance between the two  Of course  as the House knows  lawyers delight to disagree and there is a certain volume of opinion against it in America  but as pointed out by my honourable Friend  Mr  C  C  Shah  we have made drastic changes in the American clause  The American clause says that no person shall be deprived of his life  liberty or property without due process of law  That clause created great difficulties with regard to laws relating to property  That word has been omitted  The word  liberty  was construed widely so as to cover liberty of contract and that word has been qualified  This clause is now restricted to liberty of the person  that is  nobody can be convicted  sent to jailor be sentenced to death without due process of law  That is the narrow meaning of this clause which is now sought to be incorporated by amendment No  528       Now  the question we have to consider  I submit  is only this  What are the implications of this  due process   Due process  is now confined to personal liberty  This clause would enable the courts to examine not only the procedural part  the jurisdiction of the court  the jurisdiction of the legislature  but also the substantive law  When a law has been passed which entitles Government to take away the personal liberty of an individual  the court will consider whether the law which has been passed is such as is required by the exigencies of the case  and  therefore  as I said  the balance will be struck between individual liberty and the social control  In the result  Governments will have to go to the court of law and justify why a particular measure infringing the personal liberty of the citizen has been imposed  As a matter of fact  the fear that in America the  due process  clause has upset legislative measures  is not correct  I have not got the figures here  but I remember to have read it some where in over 90 per cent of the cases on the  due process  clause which have gone to the American courts  action of the legislatures has been upheld  In such matters involving personal liberty Governments had to go before the court and justify the need for passing the legislation under which the person complaining was convicted  In a democracy it is necessary that there should be given an opportunity to the Governments to vindicate the measures that they take  Apart from anything else  it is a whole some thing that a Government is given an opportunity to justify its action in a court of law       I know some honourable Members have got a feeling that in view of the emergent conditions in this country this clause may lead to disastrous consequences  With great respect I have not been able to agree with this view  Interruption   Take even our Public Safety Acts in the provinces  In view of the condition in the country they would certainly be upheld by the court of law and even if one out of several acts is not upheld  even then  I am sure  nothing is going to happen  Human ingenuity supported by the legislature and assisted by the able lawyers of each province will be sufficient to legislate in such a manner that law and order could be maintained       Therefore  my submission is that this clause is necessary for this purpose and is not likely to be abused  We have  unfortunately  in this country legislatures with large majorities  facing very severe problems  and naturally  there is a tendency to pass legislation in a hurry which give sweeping powers to the executive and the police  Now  there will be no deterrent if these legislations are not examined by a court of law  For instance  I read the other day that there is going to be a legislation  or there is already a legislation  in one province in India which denies to the accused the assistance of lawyer  How is that going to be checked  In another province  I read that the certificate or report of an executive authority  mind you it is not a Secretary of a Government  but a subordinate executive  is conclusive evidence of a fact  This creates tremendous difficulties for the accused and I think  as I have submitted  there must be some agency in a democracy which strikes a balance between individual liberty and social control        Our emergency at the moment has perhaps led us to forget that if we do not give that scope to individual liberty  and give it the protection of the courts  we will create a tradition which will ultimately destroy even whatever little of personal liberty which exists in this country  I therefore submit  Sir  that this amendment should be accepted       Shri Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar  Madras  General   Mr  Vice President  Sir  the debate on this article reveals that there seems to be a leaning on the part of a good number of members in this House in favour of the expression  due process  being retained and not for substituting the expression  procedure established by law   which is the expression suggested by the Drafting Committee in its last stage  I am using the words  in its last stage  because my honourable Friend Mr  Munshi has taken the opposite view       Sir  at least in justification of the change suggested by the Drafting Committee  I owe it to myself  to my colleagues and the respected Chairman of the Drafting Committee  to say a few words  because  up to the last moment  presumably  the House is open to conviction       The expression  due process  itself as interpreted by the English Judges connoted merely the due course of legal proceedings according to the rules and forms established for the protection of rights  and a fair trial in a court of justice according to the modes of proceeding applicable to the case  Possibly  if the expression has been understood according to its original content and according to the interpretation of English Judges  there might be no difficulty at all  The expression  however  as developed in the United States Supreme Court  has acquired a different meaning and import in a long course of American judicial decisions  Today  according to Professor Will is  the expression means  what the Supreme Court says what it means in any particular case  It is just possible  some ardent democrats may have a greater faith in the judiciary than in the conscious will expressed through the enactment of a popular legislature  Three gentlemen or five gentlemen  sitting as a court of law  and stating what exactly is due process according to them in any particular case  after listening to long discourses and arguments of briefed counsel on either side  may appeal to certain democrats more than the expressed wishes of the legislature or the action of an executive responsible to the legislature  In the development of the doctrine of  due process   the United States Supreme Court has not adopted a consistent view at all and the decisions are conflicting  One decision very often reversed another decision  I would challenge any member of the Bar with a deep knowledge of the cases in the United States Supreme Court to say that there is anything like uniformity in regard to the interpretation of  due process   One has only to take the index in the Law Reports Annotated Edition for fifteen years and compare the decisions of one year with the decisions of another year and he will come to the conclusion that it has no definite import  It all depended upon the particular Judges that presided on the occasion  Justice Holmes took a view favourable to social control  There were other Judges of a Tory complexion who took a strong view in favour of individual liberty and private property  There is no sort of uniformity at all in the decisions of the United States Supreme Court       Some of my honourable Friends have spoken as if it merely applied to cases of detention and imprisonment  The Minimum Wage Law or a Restraint on Employment have in some cases been regarded as an invasion of personal liberty and freedom  by the United States Supreme Court in its earlier decisions  the theory being that it is an essential part of personal liberty that every person in the world be she a woman  be he a child over fourteen years of age or be he a labourer  has the right to enter into any contract he or she liked and it is not the province of other people to interfere with that liberty  On that ground  in the earlier decisions of the Supreme Court it has been held that the Minimum Wage Laws are invalid as invading personal liberty  In recent times I quite realise  after the New Deal  the swing of the pendulum has been other way  Even there  there has not been any consistency or any uniformity  I hope that if this amendment is carried  in the interpretation of this clause our Supreme Court will not follow American precedence especially in the earlier stages but will mould the interpretation to suit the conditions of India and the progress and well being of the country  This clause may serve as a great handicap for all social legislation  for the ultimate relationship between employer and lab our  for the protection of children  and for the protection of women  It may prove fairly alright if only the Judges move with the times and bring to bear their wisdom on particular issues  But since the British days we have inherited a kind of faith in lawyers  legal arguments  legal consultations and in courts  I  for my part  having flourished in the law  have no quarrel with those people who believe in the lawyer  In the earlier stages of American history  lawyers ranged themselves on the side of great Trusts and Combines and in favour of Corporations who were in a position to fee them very well  sometimes in the name of personal liberty  sometimes in the name of protection of property  After all the word  personal liberty  has not the same content and meaning as is imported into it by some of our friends who naturally feel very sensitive about people being detained without a proper trial  I equally feel it but that is not the meaning of personal liberty attributed by the American Courts in the context of  due process   I trust that the House will take into account the various aspects of this question  the future progress of India  the well being and the security of the States  the necessity of maintaining a minimum of liberty  the need for co ordinating social control and personal liberty  before coming to a decision  One thing also will have to be taken into account  viz   that the security of the State is far from being so secure as we are imagining at present  Take for example the normal detention cases  I may tell you as a lawyer  I am against the man being detained without his being given an opportunity  but an opportunity is not necessarily given in a court of law  as a result of argument  as a result of evidence  as a result of examination or cross examination  Today I know in Madras a Special Committee has been appointed consisting of a Judge of the High Court  the Advocate General of Madras and another person to go into the cases of detention and to find out whether there are proper materials or not  Now all these cases might have to go to Courts of law and possibly it is a good thing for lawyers  Though I am getting old I do not despair of taking part in those contests even in the future       The support which the amendment has received reveals the great faith which the Legislature and Constitution makers have in the Judiciary of the land  The Drafting Committee in suggesting  procedure  for  due process of law  was possibly guilty of being apprehensive of judicial vagaries in the moulding of law  The Drafting Committee has made the suggestion and it is ultimately for the House to come to the conclusion whether that is correct  taking into consideration the security of the State  the need for the liberty of the individual and the harmony between the two  I am still open to conviction and if other arguments are forthcoming I might be influenced to come to a different conclusion       Mr  Z  H  Lari   Mr  Vice President  the last speaker who has spoken on this article has drawn the attention of the House to dangers to the State which are likely to arise if the article as it stands is amended by the amendment No 528 or 530  I have not got that experience which the learned speaker has but with the little knowledge of the working of the Legislatures during the last ten years  I can say that it is necessary not only in the interest of individual liberty but in the interest of proper working of legislatures that such a clause as due process of law clause should find a place in the Constitution  It is open to that speaker at the fag end of his life as a lawyer to have a fling at the profession of law but I can say that assistance of lawyers is absolutely essential to secure justice       Shri Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar  On a point of order  I had no fling at the profession of law       Mr  Z  H  Lari  I stand corrected       I feel that two things are necessary  We all know that the State  these days  is all powerful  Its coercive processes extend to the utmost limits but still there is a phase of life which must be above the processes of Executive Government  and that is individual liberty  In America no such word as  personal  existed  There the word liberty alone existed and possibly in that state of things  it was possible to interpret it in such a way as to extend the scope of due process of law to other spheres of life but when the word  personal liberty  has been definitely inserted in the clause  I doubt whether any Court which is conscious of the requirements of a State as well as conscious of the necessities of individual liberty  will be so uncharitable to the interest of the State as to interpret it in a way to thwart the proper working of the State  My friend admitted that in the latter rulings in America itself there has been a recognition of the necessities of the State and the word has been interpreted in such a way as not to obstruct the proper working of the State  My submission would be that in this land our Supreme Court will recognise the limits of individual liberty as well as the necessities of the State and interpret it in such a way as to ensure individual liberty of a man       Pandit Thakur Dass Bhargava  The Drafting Committee also said so in their note       Mr  Z  H  Lari  My friend is right  and the only reason which was given by the Drafting Committee of which the honourable Speaker who preceded me was a member also  was that the words  due process of law  is not specific and the word as was used in the Japanese Constitution is more specific  No doubt the words as they stand in the Japanese Constitution are specific because the procedure is indicated and definitely laid down there  What is the essence of the due process of law  I think they are two  First is  enquiry before you condemn a man  And then there is judgment after trial  If any procedure which is adopted by any legislature provides for the hearing of a person who is suspected or is accused  and then after a proper hearing  enables him to get the benefit of a judgment based on that enquiry  my submission is  that the requirements of the due process of law are complied with  And I would beg of the House to consider whether in any country  however emergent and however unstable its conditions  is it necessary or is it not necessary that every individual citizen should feel that he will be heard before he is condemned  and that he will be dealt with in the light of the judgment based on the enquiries and not be subject to arbitrary detention  The House will also remember that lately there was the question of drafting human rights  and already such a draft has been prepared  And one of the clauses therein is that nobody should be subjected to arbitrary detention  Now  what is the way to prevent arbitrary detention  If you have the words in this clause  as they stand at present  namely   procedure established by law  it means that the legislature is all powerful and whatever procedure is deemed proper under the circumstances will be binding upon the courts  But  Sir  there are certain procedures which are the inherent rights of man and the should not be infringed upon by any legislative Assembly  Men as well as assemblies  or any mass of people are subject to passing emotions  and you will realise that in the present state of things  particularly keeping in view the constitution that we are going to have  namely  a parliamentary government  the legislature is controlled by a Cabinet  which means by the executive  You have also the provisions about having ordinances which means that the cabinet  a body consisting of eight to ten persons  decide upon a particular course of action  issue as an ordinance  and  the legislature then has to approve of it  otherwise it would amount to a vote of censure  Therefore the legislature in the last analysis means only the cabinet or the executive and nothing but the executive  The question before us is whether you are going to give such powers to the Executive which can infringe even the elementary rights of a person  the elementary rights of personal liberty  or whether you should not put certain checks on the executive which can be done only if you accept the amendment which has been moved by a Congress member  i e   amendment No  528  My amendment No  530 is exactly similar       My friend who spoke on the other side gave instances of legislation in the British period  of rights which were curtailed  and of innocent persons jailed  But I submit with all humility  that every legislature and every government is liable to do such things which the British Government did  You cannot excuse excess of law simply because those excesses are committed by a popularly elected legislature  That is why there are two domains  one is the domain of individual liberty  and the other domain is where the State comes in to regulate our life  What do you leave to the State  You leave to the State everything except personal liberty  As to stability of the State my submission would be that if there are classes or communities which are prone to violence  there are sufficient provisions in this Constitution to deal with them  they are in article 13 There  the State can come in and curtail the liberty of such persons  and even nullify their activities  What can an individual do  If there are parties which have got objectives which run counter to the stability of the State  you have already got enough provisions where by the State can declare those bodies unlawful  But this particular clause deals with a very small sphere of action  namely  personal liberty  My submission is that our State is not so weak as to be subverted by the activities of a particular individual  and mark that  that individual will not have the liberty to do everything  He can be brought before a court  He can be judged in a court of law  no doubt  he will have the assistance of counsel and the Government will have the obligation to produce evidence against him  Does this amount to curtailing the powers of the State  Does this amount to subverting the State  Does it amount to annihilating the State  With all respect to the previous speaker  I feel he took a very uncharitable view of the citizens of our State  and took a still more uncharitable view of the strength of the State which will emerge after the promulgation of the new Constitution  No doubt  we have to go by realities  We have to take into consideration stern facts  But I may remind the House of one thing  In America  this clause is accepted and is reproduced in the Japanese Constitution  You know the Americans have been responsible for framing the Japanese Constitution  A constitution for a fascist country  a country where individuals are prone to violence  they wanted to overthrow the peace of the world  when they were drafting a constitution for such a country  composed of such citizens  they laid down clauses 31  32  33 and 34 which say that nobody shall be denied access to courts  nobody shall be arrested unless causes are shown against him  and nobody shall be denied the privilege of the assistance of counsel  May I say that if the framers of this latest constitution  based on experience and knowing the nature of the people living in Japan  who are not a very peace loving people as was demonstrated in the last war  have accepted these provisions  that means that these provisions have stood the test of time and have safeguarded the liberty of the individual and also guaranteed the integrity of the state  There are two things by which we have to go  One is experience of others  No doubt  every clause can be criticised in one way or other  But we have to be guided by experience  Here is the experience of other countries  and this has shown that the words  due process of law  can exist without jeopardising the existence of the State  Secondly  we know that not only here  but throughout the world every assembly is likely to misuse its power  It is bound to happen  Power corrupts  We should profit by the experience of other countries and by what has been observed for centuries  Or should we go by the ipse dixit of X  Y  Z who says that there seems to be some germ of disruption in this clause  My submission is that it is only making a bogey out of nothing  We should not be led away by this bogey into accepting this clause  If this clause is accepted  then the whole Constitution becomes lifeless  The article  as it stands  is lifeless and it makes also the whole Constitution lifeless  Unless you accept this amendment  you would not earn the gratitude of future generations  Therefore  Sir  I pray that this motion which has been supported by several members should be accepted       With these words  Sir  I support the amendment  Article 15      Mr  Vice President   With the permission of the House  I should like to revert to an article left over  that is article 15  I have before me the proceedings of the House from which it appears  this was considered on the 6th December last  that general discussion had concluded and I had called upon Dr  Ambedkar to reply  At that time it was suggested that efforts should be made to arrive at some kind of understanding so that those who had submitted certain amendments might feel satisfied  I do not know the position now  but we cannot wait any longer  Dr  Ambedkar  will you please make the position clear  If no understanding has been arrived at  I would ask you to reply       The Honourable Dr  B  R  Ambedkar   Mr  Vice President  I must confess that I am somewhat in a difficult position with regard to article 15 and the amendment moved by my Friend Pandit Bhargava for the deletion of the words  procedure according to law  and the substitution of the words  due process        It is quite clear to any one who has listened to the debate that has taken place last time that there are two sharp points of view  One point of view says that  due process of law  must be there in this article  otherwise the article is a nugatory one  The other point of view is that the existing phraseology is quite sufficient for the purpose  Let me explain what exactly  due process  involves       The question of  due process  raises  in my judgment  the question of the relationship between the legislature and the judiciary  In a federal constitution  it is always open to the judiciary to decide whether any particular law passed by the legislature is ultra vires or intra vires in reference to the powers of legislation which are granted by the Constitution to the particular legislature  If the law made by a particular legislature exceeds the authority of the power given to it by the Constitution  such law would be ultra vires and invalid  That is the normal thing that happens in all federal constitutions  Every law in a federal constitution  whether made by the Parliament at the Centre or made by the legislature of a State  is always subject to examination by the judiciary from the point of view of the authority of the legislature making the law  The  due process  clause  in my judgment  would give the judiciary the power to question the law made by the legislature on another ground  That ground would be whether that law is in keeping with certain fundamental principles relating to the rights of the individual  In other words  the judiciary would be endowed with the authority to question the law not merely on the ground whether it was in excess of the authority of the legislature  but also on the ground whether the law was good law  apart from the question of the powers of the legislature making the law  The law may be perfectly good and valid so far as the authority of the legislature is concerned  But  it may not be a good law  that is to say  it violates certain fundamental principles  and the judiciary would have that additional power of declaring the law invalid  The question which arises in considering this matter is this  We have no doubt given the judiciary the power to examine the law made by different legislative bodies on the ground whether that law is in accordance with the powers given to it  The question now raised by the introduction of the phrase  due process  is whether the judiciary should be given the additional power to question the laws made by the State on the ground that they violate certain fundamental principles       There are two views on this point  One view is this  that the legislature may be trusted not to make any law which would abrogate the fundamental rights of man  so to say  the fundamental rights which apply to every individual  and consequently  there is no danger arising from the introduction of the phrase  due process   Another view is this  that it is not possible to trust the legislature  the legislature is likely to err  is likely to be led away by passion  by party prejudice  by party considerations  and the legislature may make a law which may abrogate what may be regarded as the fundamental principles which safeguard the individual rights of a citizen  We are therefore placed in two difficult positions  One is to give the judiciary the authority to sit in judgment over the will of the legislature and to question the law made by the legislature on the ground that it is not good law  in consonance with fundamental principles  Is that a desirable principle  The second position is that the legislature ought to be trusted not to make bad laws  It is very difficult to come to any definite conclusion  There are dangers on both sides  For myself I cannot altogether omit the possibility of a Legislature packed by party men making laws which may abrogate or violate what we regard as certain fundamental principles affecting the life and liberty of an individual  At the same time  I do not see how five or six gentlemen sitting in the Federal or Supreme Court examining laws made by the Legislature and by dint of their own individual conscience or their bias or their prejudices be trusted to determine which law is good and which law is bad  It is rather a case where a man has to sail between Charybdis and Scylla and I therefore would not say anything  I would leave it to the House to decide in any way it likes       Mr  Vice President   I shall now put the amendments one by one to vote  No  523       The question is          That in article 15  for the words  No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law  the words  No person shall be deprived of his life or liberty without due process of law  be substituted   The amendment was negatived       Mr  Vice President   The question is         That in article 15  for the words  except according to procedure established by law  the words  due process of law  be substituted   The amendment was negatived       Mr  Vice President   No  528       Shri S  V  Krishnamurthy Rao  Mysore   I do not press it       The amendment was  by leave of the Assembly  withdrawn       Mr  Vice President  No  530       The question is          That in article 15  for the words  procedure established by law  the words  due process of law  be substituted   The amendment was negatived       Mr  Vice President   No  526      The question is          That in article 15 for the words  except according to procedure established by law  the words  save in accordance with law  be substituted   The amendment was negatived       Mr  Vice President   No  527       The question is          That in article 15 for the words  except according to procedure established by law  the words  except in accordance with law  be substituted   The amendment was negatived       Mr  Vice President   I shall put the article to vote       The question is         That article 15 stand part of the Constitution  The motion was adopted  Article 15 was added to the Constitution   \n"
