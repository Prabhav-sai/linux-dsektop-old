Actor Nayanthara has offered sincere and heartfelt apology over her latest Tamil film “Annapoorani”, a week after the makers were accused of hurting religious sentiments and the movie was pulled from streaming service Netflix.In an Instagram post on Thursday night, the "Jawan" star said the film was made to "uplift and inspire, not to cause distress"."Jai Shri Ram. I am writing this note with a heavy heart and a genuine desire to address the recent turn of events concerning our film, 'Annapoorani'. Crafting 'Annapoorani' was not just a cinematic endeavour but a heartfelt pursuit of inspiring resilience and instilling the spirit of never giving up."It aimed to mirror life's journey, where we learn that obstacles can be overcome with sheer willpower... In our sincere attempt to share a positive message, we may have inadvertently caused hurt," Nayanthara wrote.“Annapoorani” featured the 39-year-old actor star as a young woman who aims to become the best chef in the country but in order to realise her dream, she has to cook non-vegetarian food.Directed by Nilesh Krishnaa, the movie was released in theatres in December last year, before it started streaming on Netflix four weeks later. Last week, the movie kicked up a row after two complaints were filed against Nayanthara and the makers over allegations that certain scenes in the film hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus.The complaints alleged that the film makes controversial remarks about Lord Ram and also promotes 'love jihad'. Amid the controversy, the film was removed from Netflix by the makers.In her post, Nayanthara said the team wanted to share a positive message and never expected that the movie, which was showcased in theatres, would be removed from a streaming platform."My team and I never intended to hurt anyone's sentiments and we understand the gravity of this issue. Being someone who wholly believes in God and frequently visits temples across the country, it is the last thing I would intentionally do."To those whose feelings we've touched, I extend my sincere & heartfelt apologies. The intention behind 'Annapoorani' was to uplift and inspire, not to cause distress. Over the last two decades, my journey in the film industry has been guided with a singular intention - To spread positivity & foster learning from one another," she said.After the complaints, the police in Maharashtra's Thane district registered a case against eight persons, including Nayanthara, last week.The station house officer at the Naya Nagar police station said a case was registered against eight persons, including the actor and the film's producer, under Indian Penal Code sections 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups), 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings) and 505 (2) (offence committed in place of worship) read with 34 (common intention).
    

Inter Milan is hoping a midseason trophy will catapult the team to the Serie A title.The Nerazzurri are on track following a 3-0 win over Lazio in the Italian Super Cup semifinals on Friday.Serie A leader Inter will face Serie A titleholder Napoli in Monday's final.Napoli, lying eighth in the league, beat Fiorentina 3-0 on Thursday.Marcus Thuram put Inter ahead 17 minutes in at Al-Awwal Park Stadium after Federico Dimarco used a backheel flick to set up the France forward. Then Hakan Calhanoglu converted a penalty kick after the break and Davide Frattesi finished off a counterattack three minutes from time.Inter also hit the crossbar twice in a dominating performance — first by Nicolo Barella early on and then by Lautaro Martinez after Calhanoglu's penalty.The Italian Super Cup was always contested between the Serie A champion and the Italian Cup winner from the previous season but the format was changed this year to include the runners-up from those competitions — similar to the Spanish competition, which was held in the same stadium in Riyadh last week.Napoli ran away with the Serie A title last season, finishing above Lazio, while Inter beat Fiorentina in the Italian Cup final.Inter also beat Lazio 2-0 in the league last month in Rome, and won at Napoli 3-0.
    

At least 13 students were killed when a fire broke out in a school dormitory in central China's Henan province, the official media reported on Saturday.The fire at the Yingcai School in Henan's Yanshanpu village was reported to the local fire department at 11 pm local time Friday night, The People's Daily reported.All of the dead were third-grade students, a teacher told Zonglan News, a state-backed media outlet from Hebei province.One person rescued from the scene was being treated in the hospital, CCTV, China's state broadcaster said.Rescuers arrived at the scene quickly and the flames were extinguished at 11:38 pm.The manager of the school, near Nanyang City, has been detained and an investigation is under way, BBC reported.No further details about the identities of the dead or the cause of the fire were released via official channels. It was extinguished less than an hour after firefighters were alerted, Xinhua reported.The boarding school caters primarily to students in the elementary grades, though it has an attached kindergarten.Fatal fires in China are not uncommon due to lax enforcement of building and safety standards.In November, 26 people died after a large fire ripped through an office building in Luliang City, Shanxi province.A hospital fire in Beijing last April claimed the lives of at least 29 people - mostly patients - and triggered an investigation which saw 12 people detained by police for questioning.The boarding school caters primarily to students in the elementary grades, though it has an attached kindergarten. 
    

Donald Trump surrounded himself with leaders from Nikki Haley 's home state in a show of strength ahead of Tuesday's New Hampshire primary.Trump was joined at a rally at the NHU Arena in Manchester Saturday night by South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, the state's lieutenant governor and a slew of other senior officials, including the state's attorney general, treasurer and House speaker. The statewide officials, along with U.S. Reps. Joe Wilson, William Timmons and Russell Fry, appeared on stage with Trump.“Almost every politician from South Carolina's endorsing me,” Trump declared.The South Carolinians urged the voters to carry Trump to a win in New Hampshire before the contest moves to their state and its decisive early contest set for next month.“If you do that and you win by a big margin here, we'll finish the job in South Carolina,” said Murrell Smith, the speaker of the South Carolina House of Representatives.The appearances are yet another blow from South Carolina against Haley, who is hoping her appeal among independent and unaffiliated voters will propel her to a strong enough finish in New Hampshire to turn the race into a two-person contest against Trump.It comes a day after Trump received the endorsement of South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who joined him at a rally in Concord. Scott dropped his own bid for the Republican nomination in November. A dozen years ago, Haley, then serving as governor of their state, elevated Scott from the House by appointing him as senator, making him one of the nation's most prominent Black Republicans.McMaster and other top officials had already endorsed Trump. Haley has a famously fractious relationship with many of her state's Republican power brokers even as she was twice elected governor — defeating McMaster in the GOP primary the first time.Her response on Saturday made clear she hadn't forgotten that rivalry.“I'm sorry, is that the person I ran against for governor and beat?” she said. "Just checking.Haley campaign manager Betsy Ankney also brushed off the appearances at an event hosted by Bloomberg News, insisting endorsements had “never been Nikki's game.”Trump on Saturday repeatedly railed against Haley and New Hampshire's voting laws, which allow unaffiliated voters to participate in either the Republican or Democratic primary. The state's more moderate electorate is expected to make the contest much closer than it was in leadoff Iowa.“Don't listen to polls. Get out and vote. We need a big big win against these terrible people,” Trump said.Haley, meanwhile, highlighted on Saturday a gaffe Trump made at his rally the night before.Trump repeatedly suggested Haley had been in charge of keeping the Capitol secure on Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the building to try to stop his election loss from being certified. Haley was not at the Capitol that day. And Trump has consistently downplayed his administration's failure to keep the Capitol safe or his delay in trying to call off the rioters.“They're saying he got confused. That he was talking about something else, that he was talking about Nancy Pelosi," Haley said. “When you're dealing with the pressures of a presidency, we can't have someone else where we question whether they're mentally fit to do this.”“It's a distinction without a difference. It's Nikki and Nancy,” Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita said to reporters Saturday night. “What's the difference?”Even with their state's top elected Republicans and much of the congressional delegation in New Hampshire to advocate for Trump this week, some South Carolina voters were undeterred about backing other candidates.“I'm a strong Republican, and I just vote Republican because I think they have a lot in common with supporting the United States and the regular citizens of the United States,” said Sandra Chase, following an event for GOP presidential candidate Ron DeSantis in Lexington, South Carolina, on Saturday afternoon.DeSantis, coming off a second-place finish in leadoff Iowa, has shifted some of his focus away from New Hampshire, where the state's independent voters are seen to provide more of an opening for Haley. He's instead been campaigning this weekend in South Carolina.Chase said she had previously backed Trump but wanted to go in a different direction this year.“I just want to pick the best candidate, and I think the best candidate is Ron DeSantis,” she said.
    

Josh Hazlewood claimed his 11th five-wicket total in Test matches as Australia completed a 10-wicket win over West Indies on Friday before lunch on the third day of the first Test.Australia dismissed the West Indies for 120 in the 13th over of the day on Friday, leaving the home side needing just 26 runs to win.Steven Smith (11) and Usman Khawaja (9) easily completed that total for Australia, although Khawaja retired hurt after being hit by a bouncer with Australia needing one run to win. Marnus Labuschagne hit the winning run two balls later.Hazlewood already had four for 18 at the start of the day, as he helped Australia reduce the West Indies to 73 for six in its second innings before stumps on the second day. Australia led by 95 runs on the first innings after making 283 in reply to the West Indies 188.“It's nice to have the weekend off now. It's nice as a group to play on that wicket. It felt like there was enough there the whole game," Hazlewood said.“I felt I bowled just as well in the first half of the summer with no result. The wickets have been really good and playing with this team, it feels relentless and the pressure just builds all the time.”Australia captain Pat Cummins said, “It was a wicket where you always felt like there might be a ball that nips and you were in the game even when someone was scoring a few runs."“The big fella (Hazlewood) really turned it on for us this week. We had a decent lead but not a huge lead and he took the game away from them in one spell really.”The big question at the start of the day was whether the West Indies would be able to make Australia bat again. It began to look unlikely when Mitchell Starc dismissed Joshua da Silva (18) and Alzarri Joseph (16) and Hazlewood bowled Gudakesh Motie (3) to leave the West Indies 94 for nine, still needing one run to avoid an innings defeat.Shamar Joseph and Kemar Roche again produced a small rearguard action, adding 26 for the last wicket after putting on 55 for the last wicket in the first innings. Joseph already was a star of the match for his 36 in the first innings and his five 94 on debut.He hit three boundaries on Friday to add a little to the West Indies lead before he was the last man out.West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite said Shamar Joseph was a joy to be around.“He's full of energy and he makes me laugh a lot,” Brathwaite said. “He has a lot of talent, a lot of skill and he can score some runs as well.”“I thought our bowlers did extremely well to bowl out Australia for less than 300. We obviously didn't bat well both innings. Our top order didn't get going."The second and final test between the teams begins January 25 in Brisbane, a day-night match at the Gabba.
    

Australian captain Pat Cummins on Monday came in support of his teammate Usman Khawaja, saying the opener's attempt to bring to the fore the humanitarian crisis in Gaza was "not offensive".Cricket's global governing body ICC has rejected Khawaja's application to have a sticker showing a black dove holding an olive branch on his bat and shoes during the Boxing Day Test against Pakistan.Cummins said he finds no difference between Khawaja displaying a dove logo on his shoe and bat to raise awareness of humanitarian issues and teammate Marnus Labuschagne displaying an eagle on his bat which signifies a personal religious message."We really support Uzzy. He's standing up for what he believes and I think he's done it really respectfully," Cummins told reporters on the eve of the second Test at the MCG."As I said last week, 'All lives are equal', I don't think that's very offensive and I'd say the same about the dove."Backing his 37-year-old colleague who was born in Pakistan capital Islamabad, Cummins added, "That's Uzzy. I think he can really hold his head high with the way he's gone about it."But obviously there's rules in place and I believe the ICC have said they're not going to approve that. They make up the rules and you've got to accept it."Notably, the ICC reprimanded Khawaja for wearing a black armband during Australia's 360-run win over Pakistan in Perth, the action coming after he was barred from wearing boots with the messages "Freedom is a human right" and "All lives are equal" in the colours of the Palestinian flag during the match at the Optus Stadium.Labuschagne displays the symbol of an eagle on the back of his bats which represents a verse from the bible and has long been allowed to have the sticker on his bat in international cricket.Last week, Khawaja spoke about the impact that the Israel-Hamas conflict had on him."When I'm looking at my Instagram and seeing innocent kids, videos of them dying, passing away, that's what hit me the hardest," he said."I don't have any agendas other than trying to shine a light on what I feel really passionately, really strongly about."
    

The Israeli National Security Council has issued a travel advisory for its citizens in India, suspecting that an explosion near the Israeli embassy in New Delhi on Tuesday was "a possible terror attack".No one was injured in the blast that occurred near the Israel embassy in the Chanakyapuri diplomatic enclave in New Delhi on Tuesday evening.When contacted, Israeli embassy spokesperson Guy Nir said, "We can confirm that around 5:48 pm, there was a blast in close proximity to the embassy. Delhi Police and the security team are still investigating the situation."The recommendations of the Israeli National Security Council (NSC) on Tuesday, which come amid concerns of a "recurrence of events", apply especially to New Delhi.Israeli nationals have been warned to try to avoid going to crowded places (malls and markets) and places identified as serving Westerners/Jews and Israelis.They have also been urged to be on heightened alert in public places (including restaurants, hotels, pubs, etc).The recommendations also suggest avoiding openly displaying Israeli symbols, refraining from attending unsecured large-scale events, and avoiding publicising itineraries on social media as well as photographs and details of visits in real-time.The Israeli Foreign Ministry, in a press statement earlier on Tuesday, said that there were no casualties in the explosion."The incident is under investigation by the local authorities in full cooperation with the Israeli security forces", the ministry said.Soon after the explosion, which took place in a green belt area outside the Central Hindi Training Institute located near the embassy, teams of Delhi Police's Special Cell, bomb disposal squad and fire department rushed to the spot. An almost three-hour-long search operation was carried out in the area.A National Investigation Agency (NIA) team also examined the site, a senior police officer in New Delhi said.After the incident, security was further beefed up around the embassy and other Israeli establishments, according to officials.Earlier this month, the NSC warned Israelis to reconsider all their travel abroad and called on those who do need to travel overseas to avoid outward displays of their Jewish and Israeli identities amid rising antisemitism around the world amidst the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas militant group in Gaza.In the past, too, the Israeli embassy and its staff have come under attack in New Delhi.There was an explosion outside the Israeli embassy in 2021 in which cars were damaged, but no casualties were reported.In February 2012, the wife of an Israeli security staff at the embassy was injured in an attack on her car in New Delhi.Security has been high around the Israel embassy in New Delhi since the war between Israel and Hamas began earlier this year, security officials said.
    

The Delhi Police has intensified its probe into a low intensity blast that occurred near the Israel Embassy here and sources said two youths were caught on camera walking on the road close to the spot shortly before the explosion.The police have also beefed up security in the national capital after Tuesday's blast near the embassy in the Chanakyapuri diplomatic enclave, an official said.Areas around the Israel embassy and Jewish establishments in Delhi have been put under the watch of the security personnel. The local police have been asked to increase the vigil in the national capital, an official said Wednesday.According to police sources, CCTV footage have been recovered from near the spot in which two youths were found walking on the road, shortly before the blast. "It is yet to be ascertained whether they are suspects," the officer said.The security agencies have collected multiple CCTV footage from the lanes of Abdul Kalam Road and Prithviraj Road.Security officials who visited the spot said since no remnants of the explosive were found at the spot, the possibility of a "chemical explosion" cannot be ruled out.No one was injured in the blast but an "abusive" letter addressed to the Israeli ambassador was found near the site, officials said.The letter is "abusive" in nature. It has been sent to the forensic lab to check for fingerprints, they said."It's a one-page letter written in English. It is suspected to be related to some organisation with name 'Sir Allah Resistence', and the words like Zionists, Palestine and Gaza mentioned in the letter," a police source said Tuesday.The explosion and the recovery of the letter is a grim reminder of the 2021 blast near the embassy in which some cars were damaged. The National Investigation Agency had probed the case.Security has been upped around the Israel embassy since the war between Israel and Hamas began earlier this year, the oficials said.
    

Hours after Pakistan's counter-strike on Thursday in Iran's Siestan-o-Balochistan province that killed nine persons, former diplomats, intellectuals and international relations experts have weighed in over what is seen as a retaliation to Tehran violating its airspace and also expressed caution.Pakistan conducted "precision military strikes" against what it called "terrorist hideouts" in Iran's Siestan-Balochistan province that killed 9 people in the wee hours on Thursday. The attack was seen as retaliation to Iranian missile and drone attacks on Tuesday which targeted two bases of the Sunni Baloch militant group 'Jaish al-Adl' in Pakistan's unruly Balochistan province.Former foreign secretary of Pakistan Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry said Islamabad acted “responsibly” and “has proved with this response that we don't want to do it but we can do it," Geo News reported. A “friendly” country does not attack their friends but long-term thinking is required, Chaudhry said and urged the highest authorities in Pakistan and Iran to “talk” and “settle this through bilateral communications and China's help.”“Iran's government has good relations with Pakistan so we should talk to them. [Pakistan's] border situation is not okay with India and Afghanistan so I don't think they [Pakistan] would want to open up [a conflict on] another border,” the former diplomat stated.Pakistan's former high commissioner to India Abdul Basit highlighted the need to find a diplomatic solution, and said Pakistan cannot include Iran in the same “category” as India."We have partnered with them (Iran) a lot over our past. Pakistan and Iran have collaborated many times before. We should move towards de-escalation,” he was quoted as saying by the Dawn.Com.In a post on X soon after the Pakistan Army came out with a statement related to the attack, former human rights minister Shireen Mazari described Pakistan's response as “swift and proportionate”.She applauded how the “full spectrum deterrence reasserted militarily - meeting the threat at a level of our choosing & prevailing,” but rued: “One of the many disturbing questions arising is why both supposedly friendly ‘brotherly' Muslim countries, with deep historical & social ties, allowed space creation for these militant groups in each other's territories?”“Need for serious introspection by both states,” Mazari added.Political analyst Mosharraf Zaidi warned of a “very dangerous and unpredictable situation”.“For years, Iran has actively curated terrorists that target Pakistan — worst of all, Iran works with India to undermine Pakistani security. On the surface, Pakistan's targeting of these groups is perfectly defensible,” Zaidi posted on X.Pointing out that Pakistan's stakes require the absence of war, he stated: “It is no accident that Pakistan's negative economic trajectory is aligned chronologically with the regional instability it endures.” Michael Kugelman, a scholar of South Asian affairs at the Wilson Center in Washington, called for a third-party mediation.“Pakistan's retaliation appears to have been proportionate to Iran's earlier strike, and notably it targeted only militants and not Iranian security forces. With both sides even, so to speak, this provides an opening for de-escalation, if cooler heads prevail. But that's a big if,” he posted on X.Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leader and senator Sherry Rehman told Geo News that the people on both sides should “not fan the flames” and “this should stop here.”Noting that such border exchanges (between Pakistan and Iran) have been going on for a long time since 2013 and that there were treaties on it as well, she said the strike by Iran was “unpredictable” and Pakistan would have thought about the matter “a lot” before retaliating.
    

In recent years, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been marked by a complex interplay between state and non-state actors, notably employing the Political Contest Model developed by Gadi Wolfsfeld. This model illustrates the asymmetry in power and resources between state and non-state entities, exemplified by Israel’s actions in West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Jewish settlements.The quintessential Political Contest Model, as advanced by Israeli scholar Gadi Wolfsfeld, posits the narrative that during a conflict, the state actor is pitted against a non-state actor, in tandem with the germination and sustenance of a spectacular effect. The state actor is steadily accoutered with the characteristics of power and resources, such as the military prowess of the high-riding establishment and the economic premise of the regime of the day. On the other hand, the non-state actor is hard-pressed for resources and thus consequently relies upon a spectacular impact, such as that of an insurgent action, which inflicts damage to the state’s habiliments and its symbols of state power. This is the Simulacra effect of the non-state actor. The same model has been utilised by the state of Israel to rationalise its actions in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, as well as the related Jewish settlements in the contested terrain.The Israel-Palestine conflict is often scrutinised in an inquisitive quest to identify the culpable agent, leading to collateral damage and the mass destruction of human lives and the remnants of human civilisation. The prologue of “O Jerusalem” sets the stage in Israel, stating, “They knew the sound. For months before this afternoon in May 1948, the forlorn wail had symbolised the frontiers of their existence. It was the skirl of the British bagpipes, and now its call reverberated for the last time down these ancient stone passages, piping away the few British soldiers left inside the old walled city of Jerusalem. They marched in columns, silent and unsmiling, the rhythmic tramp of their boots blending with the dying notes of the bagpipes. At the head and the rear of each column, one soldier, a sten gun crooked in his elbow, broke the pattern of their unwavering stares, his restless eyes scanning the hostile stone facades around them.”The Balfour Declaration, penned by Arthur James Balfour, contained ambiguities that required interpreters and solution providers to attempt filling the gaps. Released in 1917, the declaration declared British support for the establishment of a national home for dispersed Jews in Palestine. It took the form of a letter from Arthur James Balfour, the British Foreign Secretary, to Lionel Rothschild, a leader of the Anglo-Jewish community. Despite this, there was a struggle to balance the two communities in Palestine. It was asserted that neither party should do anything to diminish the civil and religious rights of the non-Jewish communities in the land of Palestine. Thus, one can trace back to history to advance the argument that the seeds of conflict resolution were embedded in the two-nation theory, a concept that still perplexes present-day interlocutors.There is no doubt that Hamas is considered a terrorist organisation of the non-state genre. The incident on October 7, where they caused mayhem and kidnapped Jews in south Israel, is cited by Benjamin Netanyahu as a justification for the IDF’s aggressive actions and relentless attacks on northern Gaza in the early stages of the conflict. Prime Minister Netanyahu contends, “This is a fight till the finish, and the war will be carried on until the whole of the Hamas establishment is annihilated in Gaza Strip.”The UNSC has reprimanded Tel Aviv, emphasising the need for a humanitarian corridor to be provided to international aid agencies. Ceasefires, negotiated by neighbouring state actors like Egypt, have been proposed to facilitate this. Describing Israel’s involvement as a ceaseless Armageddon would not be an overstatement, according to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Israel aims to destroy both Hamas’ military and governing capabilities. Initially designated as a recalcitrant non-state actor due to its actions on October 7, 2023, Hamas has faced international criticism for the reported massive collateral damage in Gaza. While President Joe Biden expresses unwavering support for Tel Aviv, he urges less intrusive actions, emphasising the prevention of incidents like the destruction of Shifa Hospital. Similar to the Ukraine-Russia conflict, the issue of collateral damage poses a challenge for the IDF, which contends that civilian facilities, including hospitals, serve as shelters for Hamas terrorists and concealment of their strength through tunnels.The world awaits with bated breath to see how the global ecosystem will navigate the twin conflicts in Ukraine and Israel, especially with the pervasive threat of the pandemic looming. The credibility of international institutions such as the United Nations and the ambiguous stance of superpowers like the United States have come under scrutiny, notably with the aggressive actions of Houthi rebels in Yemen and the involvement of Iranian agents, which further escalates the conflict. The promotion of peace and stability must be orchestrated by the interlocutors in West Asia and the great powers collectively.The United States of America has made it clear that it will stand by Israel regardless of the circumstances, and two warship groups have been stationed in the near vicinity. President Biden has unequivocally expressed this intent to the international community, both at the UNSC and beyond. Collateral damage is strongly condemned by the Americans, as indicated by Biden’s statement regarding the tragic news related to Gad Haggai. The United States has traditionally been a staunch ally of Tel Aviv, and the Jewish lobby, despite facing dehumanisation globally, has a significant influence in the political, social, and economic life of America.A relevant and timely White House release succinctly asserts, “Today, the world faces an inflection point, where the choices we make, including in the crises in Europe and West Asia,  will determine the direction of our future for generations to come. What will our world look like on the other side of these conflicts? Will we deny Hamas the ability to carry out pure, unadulterated evil? Will Israelis and Palestinians one day live side by side in peace, with two states for two peoples?” IR theorist John Mearsheimer staunchly contends that the key pillar of US policy has been the nation-state of Israel, which, according to him, is an undeniable fact. Additional strategic imperatives and a higher moral perch have been incorporated into the US-Israel narrative, and this is prominently reflected in the contemporary crisis.(The writer teaches at International Relations and International Organisations, Indian Institute of Public Administration, New Delhi)

Atletico Madrid got the better of Real Madrid this time, beating its crosstown rival 4-2 in extra time Thursday to reach the quarterfinals of the Copa del Rey.Antoine Griezmann and Rodrigo Riquelme scored after a 2-2 draw in regulation to send Atletico to the last eight less than a week after it lost to Madrid in the semi-finals of the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia.Atletico thrived again at home, where it also beat Madrid in the first Spanish league derby of the season in September in what had been its rival's only loss this season.Atletico is unbeaten in 25 consecutive matches at its Metropolitano stadium in all competitions, with two draws since a 1-0 league defeat to Barcelona in January 2023.Defending champion Madrid eliminated Atletico in the Copa quarterfinals last season, winning 3-1 in extra time at home. The city rivals will play again on February 4 — the third meeting in less than a month — in La Liga at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium. Madrid won 5-3 in extra time in the Super Cup semi-finals last Wednesday.Griezmann secured Atletico's win this time with a beautiful goal after making a run through the right side of the area. The France international, Atletico's all-time top scorer with 175 goals, got past Madrid forward Vinícius Júnior before finding the top corner from a tight angle.“It was an amazing goal, probably one of his best,” Madrid coach Diego Simeone said. “We played a very good match and the players gave everything they had against a top opponent. It was a great match.”Riquelme sealed Atletico's win from inside the area on a breakaway in the 119th after an assist by Memphis Depay.Atletico had opened the scoring with a goal from close range by Samuel Lino after Madrid defender Antonio Rüdiger deflected the ball backwards into the area in the 39th.Madrid equalized after a rare mistake by Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak, who punched the ball into his net while trying to clear a cross.Álvaro Morata put Atletico ahead again from close range in the 57th after Madrid goalkeeper Andriy Lunin failed to fully clear a cross. The ball bounced off Rüdiger and went toward Morata in front of an open net.Striker Joselu, who came on for Rodrygo in the 80th, equalized with a header in the 82nd after a cross by Jude Bellingham. Morata had missed a clear chance in a one-on-one situation with Lunin just moments earlier.Brahim Díaz thought he had scored an equalizer late in extra time, but the goal was disallowed because of an offside by Bellingham.Bellingham hit the crossbar early in the first half, and Rodrygo struck the woodwork in the second.Madrid went on to win the Spanish Super Cup 4-1 in the final against Barcelona on Sunday, but there was no guard of honour by Atletico before the match at the Metropolitano.There was a report by The Athletic and some Spanish media that some Atletico fans called Vinícius a monkey before the game. The Brazil international had been racially abused by Atletico fans before other derbies, including by some who hanged an effigy of the player off a highway bridge last year.Simeone exchanged a few heated words with Vinícius after the end of regulation. The coach appeared to be upset with Vinícius because of his celebration after Joselu's goal. Vinícius apparently also got into a spat with one of the ball boys at the Metropolitano.“It was a very competitive match, he was involved in many duels, and sometimes you are not able to keep your cool," Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said about Vinícius. “I think it's understandable.”Ancelotti's Madrid had come into the game on an unbeaten run of 21 matches in all competitions, with 17 wins and four draws.  BARCELONA ADVANCESBarcelona picked up the pace in the second half to beat third-division club Unionistas 3-1 in its pre-quarterfinal match.It will be the second straight last-eight appearance for the Catalan club, which arrived under pressure after losing the Spanish Super Cup final to Madrid.After being held 1-1 at half-time, Barcelona improved in the second half to secure the victory with goals by Jules Koundé and Alejandro Balde.The hosts had taken the lead with a beautiful one-timer by Álvaro Gómez in the 31st minute before Ferran Torres equalized for Barcelona on a breakaway in the 45th. Koundé scored with a long-range shot in the 69th and Balde sealed the victory with a strike from a tight angle in the 73rd.“After a tough loss in the Super Cup we needed to rebound," Koundé said. “It wasn't easy, they have a good team and were very motivated."Unionistas had a few chances to move closer toward the end, but Barcelona goalkeeper Iñaki Peña made some good saves to maintain the comfortable lead at the 5,000-capacity Reina Sofia Stadium.Barcelona defender Pau Cubarsí, 16, made his first-team debut by entering the match after halftime to replace Andreas Christensen.
    

The new Ram Lalla idol was consecrated at the newly constructed temple here on Monday amid grand celebrations in the town, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi participating in the rituals.The prime minister walked inside the temple premises with a silver 'chattar' (umbrella) placed on a red folded dupatta.Dressed in a golden kurta teamed up with a cream dhoti and patka, he took ‘sankalp' for the “pran pratishtha ceremony” and later moved to the sanctum sanctorum for the rituals.RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat, Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath were also present inside the sanctorum during the rituals.Army helicopters showered flower petals on the temple premises when the consecration took place."The extraordinary moment of the consecration of Shri Ram Lala's life in Ayodhya Dham is going to leave everyone emotional.

The Israeli embassy in India pitched for promoting tourism in Lakshadweep on Monday, amid a diplomatic row between India and the Maldives over disparaging remarks made by Maldivian ministers following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the islands."We were in #Lakshadweep last year upon the federal government's request to initiate the desalination program. Israel is ready to commence working on this project tomorrow. For those who are yet to witness the pristine and majestic underwater beauty of #lakshadweepislands, here are a few pictures showing this island's enchanting allure," the Israeli embassy wrote on X.It also shared pictures of the pristine beaches and marine life in Lakshadweep.Meanwhile, the Maldivian envoy to India was summoned to the external affairs ministry on Monday and conveyed strong concern over the remarks against Modi in social media by a number of ministers of the Maldives.The Maldivian government suspended three of its deputy ministers on Sunday after they criticised Modi for his post on X following his visit to Lakshadweep, inferring that it was an attempt to project the Union Territory as an alternative tourist destination to the Maldives.The Maldivian foreign ministry said the government is aware of "derogatory remarks" made on social media platforms against foreign leaders and that the personal views do not represent the country's position.

India has said that it is in constant touch with the leaders of Israel and Palestine and its “clear and consistent” message since the start of the latest Middle East conflict has been to prevent escalation to ensure continued delivery of humanitarian aid and early restoration of peace and stability.“The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas has led to a large-scale loss of civilian lives, especially women and children, and has resulted in an alarming humanitarian crisis," India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Ruchira Kamboj said on Tuesday in the UN General Assembly."This is clearly unacceptable and we have strongly condemned the death of civilians,” she said.She underlined that India is aware that the immediate trigger was the terror attacks in Israel on October 7, which were shocking and “deserve our unequivocal condemnation. India has a zero-tolerance approach to terrorism. There can be no justification for terrorism and hostage-taking.”Kamboj said India demands the immediate and unconditional release of those taken hostage.Kamboj told the 193-member UNGA that the “leadership of India is in constant touch with the leaders of the region, including those of Israel and Palestine.”“The message that India has conveyed since the start of this conflict is clear and consistent. It is important to prevent escalation to ensure continued delivery of humanitarian aid and to work towards an early restoration of peace and stability. A peaceful resolution of the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy is the only way forward,” she said.Kamboj was addressing a General Assembly meeting Tuesday convened after the US had on December 22, 2023, vetoed an amendment proposed by Russia to a resolution tabled in the Security Council on delivery of humanitarian aid throughout the Gaza strip.The 15-nation Council had adopted the United Arab Emirates-drafted resolution that demanded scaling up humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza but had not called for a ceasefire.After days of intense negotiations and delays on a vote, the Council had adopted the resolution with 13 votes in favour, none against and abstentions by Russia and the US.An amendment to the resolution proposed by Russia was not approved after the US, a permanent member of the Council, cast a veto. This veto triggered the UNGA meeting that was convened on Tuesday. The UNGA is now required to meet and discuss any time a veto is cast in the Security Council by any of the five permanent Council members.India took note of the adoption of the Security Council resolution aimed towards scaling up humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza and commended UAE's “able leadership” in piloting the text.Kamboj said India has voiced its views on the conflict in multilateral fora such as the G20, BRICS and at the Voice of the Global South Summit in November 2023, reiterating its long-standing and principled position on the issue. India has also called for continued humanitarian aid for the affected population and in this regard, Kamboj expressed hope that the Security Council resolution adopted in December would aid in enhancing humanitarian assistance.Kamboj told the General Assembly that India has so far provided 70 tonnes of humanitarian aid, including 16.5 tonnes of medicine and medical supplies in two tranches to the people of Palestine.India has also provided five million dollars, including the 2.5 million dollars it provided in December to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). This will go to support the agency's core programs and services, including education, healthcare, relief and social services provided to Palestinian refugees, she said.Kamboj reaffirmed India's firm commitment to achieving a just, peaceful and lasting solution to the Israel-Palestine issue. “We firmly believe that only a two-state solution achieved through direct and meaningful negotiations between both sides on final status issues will deliver an enduring peace that the people of Israel and Palestine desire and deserve.”She said that for this, India urges the parties to de-escalate, eschew violence and work towards creating conditions for an early resumption of direct peace negotiations. Ambassador Robert Wood, Alternate Representative for Special Political Affairs at the US Mission to the UN, said that the adoption of the UNSC resolution had demonstrated Washington's commitment to working with other Council members to speak out on this humanitarian crisis.“This work supports the direct diplomacy the United States is engaged in to get more humanitarian aid into Gaza and to help get hostages out of Gaza. And it is unfortunate that rather than contributing to the hard work of diplomacy, one permanent member of the Security Council continues to put forward amendments and ideas that are disconnected from the situation on the ground,” he said, referring to the amendment tabled by Moscow that Washington vetoed.As member states addressed the plenary, dozens of rabbis demonstrated on the balcony inside the Security Council chambers and disrupted the General Assembly plenary session to demand that the U.S. Stop preventing the UN from taking urgent action for an immediate, permanent ceasefire in Gaza.Led by Rabbis 4 Ceasefire, and co-organised by Jews For Racial & Economic Justice (JFREJ), Jewish Voice for Peace, and IfNotNow, the 36 rabbis recited prayers and excerpts of the UN Declaration of Human Rights, held a memorial service while holding up banners that read 'Biden: The World Says Ceasefire', 'Biden: Stop Vetoing Peace' and 'Biden: Rabbis Demand Ceasefire Now'. The rabbis were escorted out of the UN building by security, a release said.
