      " A 71 year old Illinois man accused of fatally stabbing a 6 year old boy and seriously wounding a 32 year old woman was charged with a hate crime Sunday  Police allege he singled out the victims because of their Islamic faith and as a response to the war between Israel and Hamas In recent days  police in US cities and federal authorities have been on high alert for violence driven by antisemitic or Islamophobic sentiments  FBI officials  along with Jewish and Muslim groups  have reported an increase of hateful and threatening rhetoric In the Chicago area case  officers found the woman and boy late Saturday morning at a home in an unincorporated area of Plainfield Township  about 40 miles  65 kilometers  southwest of Chicago  the Will County Sheriff s Office said in a statement on social media The boy was pronounced dead at a hospital  The woman had multiple stab wounds and was expected to survive  according to the statement  An autopsy on the child showed he had been stabbed dozens of times “Detectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the on going Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis ” the sheriff s statement said According to the Will County sheriff s office  the woman had called 911 to report that her landlord had attacked her with a knife  adding she then ran into a bathroom and continued to fight him off The man suspected in the attack was found Saturday outside the home and “sitting upright outside on the ground near the driveway of the residence” with a cut on his forehead  authorities said Joseph M  Czuba of Plainfield was charged with first degree murder  attempted first degree murder  two counts of hate crimes and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon  according to the sheriff s office  He was in custody Sunday and awaiting a court appearance Attempts to reach Czuba or a family member were unsuccessful Sunday  His home phone number was unlisted  Messages left for possible relatives in online records and on social media were not immediately returned  The sheriff s office and county public defender s office did not immediately return messages about Czuba s legal representation Authorities did not release the names of the two victims But the boy s paternal uncle  Yousef Hannon  spoke at a news conference Sunday hosted by the Chicago chapter Council on American Islamic Relations  There the boy was identified as Wadea Al Fayoume  a Palestinian American boy who recently had turned 6  The organisation identified the other victim as the boy s mother “We are not animals  we are humans  We want people to see us as humans  to feel us as humans  to deal with us as humans  because this is what we are ” said Hannon  a Palestinian American who emigrated to the U S  In 1999 to work  including as a public school teacher The Muslim civil liberties organisation called the crime “our worst nightmare” and part of a disturbing spike in hate calls and emails since the outbreak of the Israel Hamas war  The group cited text messages exchanged among family members that showed the attacker had made disparaging remarks about Muslims “Palestinians basically  again  with their hearts broken over what s happening to their people ” said Ahmed Rehab  the group s executive director  “have to also worry about the immediate safety of life and limb living here in this most free of democracies in the world  In response to the increased threats  the Illinois State Police are communicating with federal law enforcement and reaching out to Muslim communities and religious leaders to offer support  according to a Sunday press release from Illinois Democratic Gov  JB Pritzker “To take a six year old child s life in the name of bigotry is nothing short of evil   Pritzker said   Wadea should be heading to school in the morning  Instead  his parents will wake up without their son  This wasn t just a murder   it was a hate crime  And every single Illinoisan   including our Muslim  Jewish  and Palestinian neighbors   deserves to live free from the threat of such evil ”President Joe Biden echoed that sentiment Sunday  saying in a statement  “This horrific act of hate has no place in America  and stands against our fundamental values  freedom from fear for how we pray  what we believe  and who we are ”FBI Director Chris Wray said on a call with reporters Sunday that the FBI is also moving quickly to mitigate the threats A senior FBI official who spoke on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Bureau said the majority of the threats that the FBI has responded to were not judged to be credible  adding that the FBI takes them all seriously nonetheless The official also said that agents have been encouraged to be “aggressive” and proactive in communicating over the last week with faith based leaders  The official said the purpose is not to make anyone feel targeted but rather to ask clerics and others to report to law enforcement anything that seems suspicious        The list reads 2009  2010  2011  2012  2015  2019  2021  and now 2023 Lionel Messi won the men s Ballon d Or for a record extending eighth time on Monday after fulfilling his life s ambition by leading Argentina to the World Cup title in Qatar last year Adding to his silverware the one major trophy that eluded him in his storied career was the decisive factor in an otherwise quite mundane season   for his standards   at Paris Saint Germain The 36 year old Messi won ahead of Manchester City forward Erling Haaland and his former PSG teammate Kylian Mbappe Messi thanked his Argentina coach  teammates and staff for making his victory possible  Tonight I m enjoying myself  It s a pleasure that will never leave me  and I hope to be able to enjoy it for many years to come   Messi said through a translator  Becoming world champion was the title we were missing  I d like to thank everyone who helped make Argentina the world champion team  Messi also paid tribute to the late Diego Maradona  who also helped Argentina win the World Cup  back in 1986  This title and this trophy   Messi said   I share them with you and all our Argentina comrades  Aitana Bonmati won the women s award for guiding Spain to victory at the Women s World Cup in August  She also helped Barcelona win the Women s Champions League and Spanish league A year after missing out on the shortlist for the 2022 Ballon d Or  and despite leaving top level European soccer behind  Messi has recovered his crown He won the sport s biggest individual prize due to his tremendous World Cup  In Qatar  Messi was involved in 10 goals for Argentina  scoring seven and assisting three  He scored twice in the final against France His final season with PSG was less shiny  Although PSG won a record extending 11th French league  it again exited the Champions League in the round of 16 Nobody else has won more than five Ballon d Or  Cristiano Ronaldo has five  and Michel Platini  Johan Cruyff and Marco van Basten each won it three times Since moving to Inter Miami in the United States  Messi has already picked up his first silverware there by inspiring the team to victory in the U S  Leagues Cup Messi s latest win marked the first time a Major League Soccer based player got such recognition  Messi received the trophy from former Manchester United star David Beckham  who is one of the owners of his new club  I m very happy with the decisions I ve made and to be with Miami   Messi said He succeeded Karim Benzema Mbappe hoped another Frenchman could win the Ballon d Or after he scored a hat trick in the World Cup final  though France lost in a penalty shootout Haaland led City to a treble of trophies last season   Champions League  English Premier League  FA Cup   while scoring 52 goals Bonmati had already been awarded UEFA best women s player and the Golden Ball for the top Women s World Cup player  She scored three times and assisted twice at the tournament She followed in the footsteps of her teammate Alexia Putellas  who took the past two awards Bonmati won ahead of Sam Kerr and Salma Paralluelo  We are a country that lives football  intensely ” Bonmati said  “We have a unique talent in Spain  For the first time last year  the trophy awarded by France Football magazine was based on achievements from the past season  It was previously awarded based on performances through a calendar year  Stanley Matthews won the first Ballon d Or in 1956 The women s trophy was created in 2018  and both were cancelled in 2020 because of the pandemic In other awards  the best under 21 player was Jude Bellingham  while Haaland won the Gerd Müller award for the best striker of the year The Lev Yashin award for best goalkeeper went to Emiliano Martinez  In addition to his trophy  the Argentina goalkeeper collected boos and whistles from the audience at the Theatre du Chatelet that included Mbappe and France coach Didier Deschamps Martinez was criticized for the excessive tone of his World Cup celebrations  He carried a doll with Mbappe s face on it while standing alongside teammate Messi as Argentina paraded the trophy back home  Martinez  who also made a crude gesture after winning the Golden Glove award for best goalkeeper  was filmed mocking Mbappe in the team dressing room after the game         Israeli warplanes struck targets across Gaza early Monday  including in areas where Palestinian civilians have been told to seek refuge  after another small aid shipment was allowed into the besieged Hamas ruled territory Israel is widely expected to launch a ground offensive in Gaza following Hamas  brutal October 7 rampage into southern Israeli communities Tanks and troops have been massed at the Gaza border  and Israel says it has stepped up airstrikes in order to reduce the risk to troops in the next stages Fears of a widening war have grown as Israeli warplanes have struck targets in the occupied West Bank  Syria and Lebanon in recent days It has frequently traded fire with Lebanon s Hezbollah militant group  which is armed with tens of thousands of rockets Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told troops in northern Israel on Sunday that if Hezbollah launches a war   it will make the mistake of its life  We will cripple it with a force it cannot even imagine  and the consequences for it and the Lebanese state will be devastating ”More than 1 400 people in Israel have been killed   mostly civilians slain during the initial Hamas attack At least 212 people were captured and dragged back to Gaza  Two Americans were released Friday  hours before the first shipment of humanitarian aid More than 4 600 people have been killed in Gaza  according to the Hamas run Health Ministry  That includes the disputed toll from a hospital explosion Israel has carried out limited ground forays into Gaza  and on Sunday  Hamas said it had destroyed an Israeli tank and two armoured bulldozers inside the territory it has ruled since 2007 The Israeli military said a soldier was killed and three others were wounded by an anti tank missile during a raid inside Gaza The military said the raid was part of efforts to rescue hostages abducted in the October 7 attack  Hamas hopes to trade the captives for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel On Saturday  20 trucks entered Gaza in the first aid shipment into the territory since Israel imposed a complete siege at the start of the war Israel allowed a second convoy of 15 trucks into Gaza on Sunday  Both entered from Egypt through the Rafah crossing  the only way into Gaza not controlled by Israel COGAT  the Israeli defence body responsible for Palestinian civilian affairs  said the aid was allowed in at the request of the United States  and included water  food and medical supplies  It said everything was inspected by Israel before it was brought into Gaza In a Sunday phone call  Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden “affirmed that there will now be continued flow of this critical assistance into Gaza ” the White House said in a statement Relief workers said far more aid was needed to address the spiralling humanitarian crisis in Gaza  where half the territory s 2 3 million people have fled their homes The UN humanitarian agency said the 20 trucks that entered Saturday amounted to 4 per cent of an average day s imports before the war and “a fraction of what is needed after 13 days of complete siege ”The Israeli military said the humanitarian situation was “under control ” even as the UN called for 100 trucks a day to enter Israel has not allowed any fuel to enter Gaza  where there has been a full power blackout for more than a week and where hospitals say they are scrounging for generator fuel in order to keep operating life saving medical equipment and incubators for premature babies The World Health Organisation said seven hospitals in northern Gaza have been forced to shut down due to damage from strikes  lack of power and supplies  or Israeli evacuation orders The lack of fuel has also crippled water and sanitation systems  Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians sheltering in UN run schools and tent camps are running low on food and are drinking dirty water Israel repeated its calls for people to leave northern Gaza  including by dropping leaflets from the air  It estimated 700 000 have already fled But hundreds of thousands remain  That would raise the risk of mass civilian casualties in any ground offensive Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Israel “can t go back to the status quo” in which Hamas controls Gaza and is able to threaten it  but that Israel has “absolutely no intent” to govern Gaza itself “Something needs to be found that ensures that Hamas can t do this again  but that also doesn t revert to Israeli governance of Gaza ” he told NBC s “Meet the Press” on Sunday “It s something that needs to be worked even as Israel is dealing with the current threat ”Israel captured Gaza  along with the West Bank and east Jerusalem  in the 1967 Mideast war  The Palestinians want all three territories for a future state Israel withdrew troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005  but Israel and Egypt have imposed a blockade of varying degrees since Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007 Heavy Israeli airstrikes and shelling continued overnight across Gaza  the Hamas run Interior Ministry said It said airstrikes hit residential apartments in the town of Khan Younis and the Nuseirat refugee camp  both of which are south of the evacuation line The Palestinian Red Crescent medical service reported heavy overnight airstrikes near al Quds hospital in Gaza City  Aside from patients  the hospital houses more than 12 000 displaced people  it said The Israeli military says it does not target civilians  It says Palestinian militants have fired over 7 000 rockets at Israel since the start of the war The military said Monday that it had struck 320 militant targets throughout Gaza over the last 24 hours It said it had destroyed anti tank positions and other targets that could endanger forces preparing for “a maneuver in the Gaza Strip ” an apparent reference to a ground operation        Israel s military directed the evacuation on Friday of all of the hundreds of thousands of civilians living in Gaza City ahead of a feared Israel ground offensive  The directive came on the heels of what the United Nations said was a warning they received from Israel to evacuate 1 1 million people living in the north of Gaza within 24 hours The Israeli military order  which comes on the seventh day of a war declared by Israel following an unprecedented Hamas incursion and deadly attack  directs residents of Gaza City to flee deeper south into the Gaza Strip  a narrow coastal territory  Israel s directive charged that Hamas militants were hiding in tunnels under the city “This is chaos  no one understands what to do ” said Inas Hamdan  an officer at the U N  Palestinian refugee agency in Gaza City while she grabbed whatever she could throw into her bags as the panicked shouts of her relatives could be heard around her  She said all the U N  Staff in Gaza City and northern Gaza had been told to evacuate south to Rafah “This evacuation is for your own safety ” the Israeli military said  in a warning it said was sent to Gaza City civilians The flurry of directives could signal an impending ground offensive  though the Israeli military has not yet confirmed such a move  On Thursday it said that while it was preparing  no decision has been made Israel delivered an even broader evacuation order   giving almost half of tiny Gaza s population 24 hours to flee to the territory s south   to the U N   spokesman Stephane Dujarric said  The Israeli military did not immediately confirm the broader evacuation order The broad order for all of Gaza s north also applies to all U N  Staff and to the hundreds of thousands who have taken shelter in U N  Schools and other facilities since Israel launched round the clock airstrikes Saturday “The United Nations considers it impossible for such a movement to take place without devastating humanitarian consequences ” Dujarric said “The United Nations strongly appeals for any such order  if confirmed  to be rescinded avoiding what could transform what is already a tragedy into a calamitous situation ” the spokesman said Another U N  Official said that the United Nation is trying to get clarity from Israeli officials at the senior most political level “It s completely unprecedent ” the official said  speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak publicly Panicked rumors of an evacuation had begun to spread in north Gaza in the early morning Friday A ground offensive in Gaza  which is ruled by Hamas and where the population is densely packed into a sliver of land only 40 kilometers  25 miles  long  would likely bring even higher casualties on both sides in brutal house to house fighting Hamas  assault Saturday and smaller attacks since have killed more than 1 300 people in Israel  including 247 soldiers   a toll unseen in Israel for decades   and the ensuing Israeli bombardment has killed more than 1 530 people in Gaza  according to authorities on both sides Israel says roughly 1 500 Hamas militants were killed inside Israel  and that hundreds of the dead in Gaza are Hamas members  Thousands have been wounded on both sides As Israel pounds Gaza from the air  Hamas militants have fired thousands of rockets into Israel  Amid concerns that the fighting could spread in the region  Syrian state media reported that Israeli airstrikes on Thursday put two Syrian international airports out of service Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to “crush” Hamas after the militants stormed into the country s south on Saturday and massacred hundreds of people  including killings of children in their homes and young people at a music festival Amid grief and demands for vengeance among the Israeli public  the government is under intense pressure to topple Hamas rather than continuing to try to bottle it up in Gaza The number of people forced from their homes by Israel s airstrikes soared 25 per cent in a day  reaching 423 000 out of a population of 2 3 million  the U N  Said Thursday On Thursday  the Israeli military pulverized the Gaza Strip with airstrikes  prepared for a possible ground invasion and said its complete siege of the territory   which has left Palestinians desperate for food  fuel and medicine   would remain in place until Hamas militants free some 150 hostages taken during their grisly weekend incursion A visit by Secretary of State Antony Blinken  along with shipments of U S  Weapons  offered a powerful green light to Israel to drive ahead with its retaliation in Gaza after Hamas  deadly attack on civilians and soldiers  even as international aid groups warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis  Israel has halted deliveries of basic necessities and electricity to Gaza s 2 3 million people and prevented entry of supplies from Egypt “Not a single electricity switch will be flipped on  not a single faucet will be turned on and not a single fuel truck will enter until the Israeli hostages are returned home ” Israeli Energy Minister Israel Katz said on social media Lt  Col  Richard Hecht  an Israeli military spokesman  told reporters Thursday that forces “are preparing for a ground maneuver” should political leaders order one        Israel has been badly victimised  but it should explore the opportunity to relieve the suffering of people in Gaza who have nowhere to go  US President Joe Biden said following his trip to Israel  “Look  Israel has been badly victimised  But the truth is that if they have an opportunity to relieve the suffering of people who have nowhere to go  it’s what they should do  And if they don t  they ll be held accountable in ways that may be unfair ” Biden told reporters aboard Air Force One on his way back from Israel on Wednesday  “And my point to everyone is  look  if you have an opportunity to alleviate the pain  you should do it  period  And if you don t  you re going to lose credibility worldwide  And I think everyone understands that ” Biden said after he spent several hours in Israel in the aftermath of the terrorist strike from Hamas Israel is likely planning retaliation and a possible ground invasion of Gaza against Hamas for its October 7 attack that killed around 1 400 people in Israel The US has asked for massive humanitarian aid for the people of Gaza and is in the process of providing defence military assistance to Israel Biden said Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi agreed to open up the Rafah gate to allow up to 20 trucks of humanitarian assistance into Gaza  “If Hamas confiscates them or doesn’t let it get through … then it’s going to end ” he said  “The bottom line is Sisi deserves a lot of credit ” he added The White House  in a readout of the phone call between the two leaders  said Biden and Al Sisi discussed ongoing coordination to deliver humanitarian assistance to Gaza and mechanisms to ensure the aid is distributed for the benefit of the civilian population “The two leaders agreed to work together closely on encouraging an urgent and robust international response to the UN’s humanitarian appeal  They agreed on the need to preserve stability in the Middle East  prevent escalation of the conflict  and set the circumstances for a durable  permanent peace in the region ” the White House said On his way back from Israel  Biden was asked about the odds of Israeli forces launching a ground invasion of Gaza  “We had a long talk about that and what alternatives there are  Our military is talking with their military about what the alternatives are  but I’m not going to go into that  either ” the president said The US president added that he found Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu receptive to the humanitarian aid argument “Well  we ve had a number of discussions on this  I don t know what you picked up in Israel  but I got no pushback  Virtually none  Let me say it again  I got no pushback   from  All the partners  virtually none  I m hopeful we can get some Americans out as well of Gaza and I m hopeful we can continue to work toward getting other Americans out through other means as well ” Biden said       Terrorism is a  malignancy  and knows no borders  nationality or race and the world should not buy into any justification of terror acts  India has told the UN General Assembly as it abstained on a resolution on the Israel Hamas conflict India on Friday abstained in the UN General Assembly on a Jordanian drafted resolution titled ‘Protection of civilians and upholding legal and humanitarian obligations  that called for an immediate humanitarian truce in the Israel Hamas conflict and unhindered humanitarian access in the Gaza strip The 193 member General Assembly adopted the resolution that called for an immediate  durable and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities The resolution  which garnered 121 votes in favour  44 abstentions and 14 member states voting against it  also demanded the immediate  continuous  sufficient and unhindered provision of essential goods and services to civilians throughout the Gaza Strip India s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Yojna Patel  in Explanation of Vote here said in a world where differences and disputes should be resolved by dialogue  this august body should be deeply concerned at recourse to violence  That too  when it happens on a scale and intensity that is an affront to basic human values ” Patel said Patel said that violence as a means to achieve political objectives damages indiscriminately and does not pave the way for any durable solutions Describing the terror attacks in Israel on October 7 as shocking  Patel said they deserve condemnation  India s explanation of the vote did not mention Hamas “Terrorism is a malignancy and knows no borders  nationality or race  The world should not buy into any justification of terror acts  Let us keep aside differences  unite and adopt a zero tolerance approach to terrorism ” she said India expressed hope that the deliberations of the General Assembly will “send a clear message against terror and violence and expand prospects for diplomacy and dialogue while addressing the humanitarian crisis that confronts us ”Patel said India is “deeply concerned” at the deteriorating security situation and astounding loss of civilian lives in the ongoing conflict “The escalation of hostilities in the region will only exacerbate the humanitarian crisis  It is necessary for all parties to display the utmost responsibility ” she said  India also called for the “immediate and unconditional release” of the hostages Earlier  Iraq had abstained on the resolution but later changed its vote to a yes citing “a technical problem” at the time of voting  Countries voting against the resolution included Israel and the US  China  France  and Russia voted in favour of the resolution while Canada  Germany  Japan  Ukraine and the UK abstained The resolution called for immediate  full  sustained  safe and unhindered humanitarian access for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and other United Nations humanitarian agencies and their implementing partners  the International Committee of the Red Cross and all other humanitarian organisations upholding humanitarian principles and delivering urgent assistance to civilians in the Gaza Strip It encourages the establishment of humanitarian corridors and other initiatives to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to civilians and welcomes efforts on this Patel stressed that casualties in the ongoing conflict in Gaza are a telling  serious and continuing concern and it is civilians  especially women and children  who are paying with their lives “This humanitarian crisis needs to be addressed ” Patel said  welcoming the international community s de escalation efforts and delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza She noted that India too has contributed to this effort  India has sent 38 tons of humanitarian goods  including medicines and equipment to the people of Palestine Patel reiterated that India has always supported a negotiated two state solution to the Israel Palestine issue  leading to the establishment of a sovereign  independent and viable state of Palestine  living within secure and recognised borders  side by side in peace with Israel “For this  we urge the parties to de escalate  eschew violence and work towards creating conditions for an early resumption of direct peace negotiations ” she said The Jordanian drafted resolution did not make any mention of the militant group Hamas Before the General Assembly voted on the resolution  the 193 member body considered an amendment proposed by Canada and co sponsored by the US to the text The amendment proposed by Canada asked for inserting a paragraph in the resolution that would state that the General Assembly “Unequivocally rejects and condemns the terrorist attacks by Hamas that took place in Israel starting on 7 October 2023 and the taking of hostages  demands the safety  well being and humane treatment of the hostages in compliance with international law  and calls for their immediate and unconditional release ”India voted in favour of the amendment  along with 87 other nations  while 55 member states voted against and 23 abstentions The draft amendment could not be adopted  having failed to obtain a 2 3rd majority of members present and voting The adopted resolution called for the rescinding of the order by “Israel  the occupying Power”  for Palestinian civilians and United Nations staff  as well as humanitarian and medical workers  to evacuate all areas in the Gaza Strip north of the Wadi Gaza and relocate to southern Gaza It also called for the immediate and unconditional release of all civilians who are being illegally held captive  demanding their safety  well being and humane treatment in compliance with international law It emphasised the importance of preventing further destabilisation and escalation of violence in the region and in this regard called upon all parties to exercise maximum restraint and upon all those with influence on them to work toward this objective Meanwhile  UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres voiced deep concern at the humanitarian system in Gaza  saying it is facing a total collapse with unimaginable consequences for more than 2 million civilians Guterres noted that about 500 trucks per day were crossing into Gaza before the hostilities began but in recent days  an average of only 12 trucks per day have entered  despite needs being far greater than at any time before  Further  the supplies that have trickled in do not include fuel for United Nations operations “Given the desperate and dramatic situation  the United Nations will not be able to continue to deliver inside Gaza without an immediate and fundamental shift in how aid is going in ” Guterres said He added that the verification system for the movement of goods through the Rafah crossing must be adjusted to allow many more trucks to enter Gaza without delay Guterres underscored that life saving humanitarian aid – food  water  medicine  fuel – must be allowed to reach all civilians swiftly  safely and at scale “Misery is growing by the minute  Without a fundamental change  the people of Gaza will face an unprecedented avalanche of human suffering ” the UN chief said        US President Joe Biden will travel to Israel on Wednesday to demonstrate his support for Israel in the aftermath of the Hamas attack  the White House announced Monday  adding that he would also travel to Jordan for a summit meeting with the heads of States of Jordan  Egypt and the president of Palestinian Authority “President Joseph R  Biden  Jr  Will travel to Israel on Wednesday  October 18  to demonstrate his steadfast support for Israel in the face of Hamas s brutal terrorist attack and to consult on next steps ” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean Pierre said in a statement on Monday night Biden will then travel to Amman  Jordan  where he will meet with His Majesty King Abdullah of Jordan  Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi  and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas “He will reiterate that Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian people s right to dignity and self determination and discuss the humanitarian needs of civilians in Gaza ” Jean Pierre said Earlier in the day  the US president spoke over the phone with his Egyptian counterpart El Sisi and Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al Sudani of Iraq during which they talked about the situation in the region after the Hamas terrorist attack in Israel In the call  Biden and El Sisi discussed ongoing efforts to alleviate the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza  in coordination with the United Nations  UN   Jordan  the Palestinian Authority  Israel  and other regional partners  and the need to preserve stability in the Middle East more broadly “Biden condemned Hamas  terrorist attack on Israel and reiterated that Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian people s right to dignity and self determination  The two leaders agreed to continue their close coordination to prevent the conflict from widening and ensure humanitarian assistance reaches those in need ” said a readout of the call In Biden s call with Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al Sudani of Iraq  they discussed ongoing efforts to prevent an expansion of the conflict in Gaza in the wake of Hamas  abhorrent attack in Israel “The two leaders discussed the importance of addressing the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza  in coordination with the UN and regional partners ” said a readout of the call Biden and Al Sudani also affirmed the importance of the bilateral partnership between Iraq and the United States as outlined in the Strategic Framework Agreement between our two countries  They finally committed to regular coordination between their teams to advance shared objectives and preserve regional stability over the coming weeks  the readout said Meanwhile  US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant to continue discussions on Israel s operations to restore security following the Hamas attack  The Secretary reiterated the US  commitment to continue expediting security assistance and preventing conflict escalation  a media release said Austin emphasised civilian safety and thanked the Gallant for efforts to restore safe drinking water access in Gaza  it said In the morning  Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were briefed by their national security team on the latest updates in the wake of Hamas  abhorrent attack in Israel and the resulting conflict in Gaza Chief of Staff Jeff Zients joined the briefing led by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan  Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines  and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Bill Burns  the White House said        Israeli forces backed by fighter jets and drones carried out a second ground raid into Gaza in as many days and struck targets on the outskirts of Gaza City  the military said Friday  as it prepares for a widely expected ground invasion of the Hamas ruled territory US warplanes meanwhile struck targets in eastern Syria that the Pentagon said were linked to Iran s Revolutionary Guard after a string of attacks on US forces by Iran backed fighters  adding to the already high regional tensions fueled by the three week old Gaza war The Palestinian death toll has soared past 7 000 as Israel has carried out waves of devastating airstrikes in response to a bloody Hamas incursion into southern Israel on Oct 7  The Health Ministry in Gaza  which tracks the toll  released a detailed list of names and ID numbers on Thursday  The toll includes more than 2 900 minors and more than 1 500 women The overall number of deaths far exceeds the combined toll of all four previous wars between Israel and Hamas  estimated at around 4 000 More than 1 400 people in Israel  mostly civilians  were slain during the initial Hamas attack  according to the Israeli government  Hamas is holding at least 229 captives inside Gaza  including men  women  children and older adults The airstrikes have flattened entire neighborhoods  causing a level of death and destruction unseen in the last four wars between Israel and Hamas  Over a million people have fled their homes  with many heeding Israeli orders to evacuate to the south  despite continuing Israeli strikes across the sealed off territory The humanitarian crisis sparked by the war and the Israeli siege has sparked protests across the region  and more demonstrations were expected later Friday after weekly Muslim prayers The military said ground forces raided inside Gaza  striking dozens of militant targets over the past 24 hours  It said aircraft and artillery bombed targets in Shijaiyah  a neighborhood on the outskirts of Gaza City that was the scene of a bloody urban battle in the 2014 Gaza war The military said the soldiers exited the territory without suffering any casualties  It reported an earlier raid into northern Gaza early Thursday  saying ground forces battled militants and struck anti tank missile firing positions in an operation that lasted hours Rear Adm  Daniel Hagari  an Israeli military spokesman  said the raids enable forces to “uncover the enemy ” to kill militants and to remove explosives and launch pads  The aim is “to prepare the ground for the next stages of the war ” he added The damage to Gaza from nearly three weeks of bombardment showed in satellite photos of several locations taken before the war and again in recent days Entire rows of residential buildings simply disappear in the photos  reduced to smears of dust and rubble  A complex of 13 high rises by the sea was pounded to dust near Gaza City s al Shati refugee camp  leaving only a few tottering bits of facade  Just down the street  hardly anything remained in what had been a neighborhood of low built homes on winding lanes  according to the photos by Maxar Technologies The military says it only strikes militant targets and accuses Hamas of operating among civilians in an attempt to protect its fighters  The Israeli military said an airstrike killed one of two masterminds of the Oct  7 massacre  Shadi Barud  the head of Hamas  intelligence unit Palestinian militants have fired thousands of rockets into Israel since the war began Hamas  military wing said Thursday that Israeli bombardment has so far killed about 50 of the hostages  There was no immediate comment from Israeli officials  who have denied previous  similar claims The conflict has threatened to ignite a wider war across the region Hezbollah  an Iranian backed ally of Hamas in Lebanon  has repeatedly traded fire with Israel along the border  and Israel has carried out airstrikes targeting Iran linked groups in Syria  The United States has sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the region  along with additional fighter jets and other weaponry and personnel  in part to deter Iran and its allies from entering the war on the side of Hamas U S  Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the strikes in eastern Syria were “a response to a series of ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against U S  Personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian backed militia groups that began on Oct  17 ”He said President Joe Biden directed the narrowly tailored strikes “to make clear that the United States will not tolerate such attacks and will defend itself  its personnel and its interests ” He added that the operation was separate and distinct from Israel s war against Hamas Syrian opposition activists in the area said the two locations are associated with Iranian arms shipments to militant groups in the region  and had been evacuated ahead of the strikes  There were no immediate reports of casualties Egyptian state media reported that six people were lightly wounded when a rocket slammed into a medical building in the town of Taba  on the border with Israel  It was not immediately known who fired the projectile Hagari  the Israeli military spokesperson  said “an aerial threat was identified in the area of the Red Sea ” which appeared to be the source of the blast in Egypt  He said fighter jets were dispatched to the area and that Israel  Egypt and the U S  Were tightening their defenses in the region Last week  a U S  Navy destroyer in the northern Red Sea shot down three cruise missiles and several drones launched toward Israel by Iran backed Houthi rebels in northern Yemen In Gaza  supplies of food  medicine and fuel for powering emergency generators are running low  The U N  Agency for Palestinian refugees  which provides basic services to hundreds of thousands of people  including operating schools turned into shelters  has said it may run out of fuel within days Gaza s sole power station shut down for lack of fuel days after the start of the war  and Israel has barred all fuel deliveries  saying it believes Hamas would steal them for military purposes About 1 4 million of Gaza s 2 3 million residents have fled their homes  with nearly half of them crowding into U N  Shelters  Hundreds of thousands remain in northern Gaza  despite Israel ordering them to evacuate to the south and saying that those who remain might be considered “accomplices” of Hamas In recent days  Israel has let more than 70 trucks with aid enter from Egypt through the Rafah crossing  the only entry point into Gaza not controlled by Israel  But aid workers say the convoys meet only a tiny fraction of the territory s mounting humanitarian needs  Before the war  an average of 500 trucks entered Gaza each day The U S  Has been working with other mediators to send in more humanitarian aid  but Israel is demanding strict screening to make sure none falls into the hands of Hamas  The U S  Says Hamas has meanwhile refused to open the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing to let hundreds of foreign passport holders leave        US fighter jets launched airstrikes early Friday on two locations in eastern Syria linked to Iran s Revolutionary Guard Corps  the Pentagon said  in retaliation for a slew of drone and missile attacks against U S  Bases and personnel in the region that began early last week The U S  Strikes reflect the Biden administration s determination to maintain a delicate balance  The U S  Wants to hit Iranian backed groups suspected of targeting the U S  As strongly as possible to deter future aggression  possibly fueled by Israel s war against Hamas  while also working to avoid inflaming the region and provoking a wider conflict According to a senior U S  Military official  the precision strikes were carried out near Boukamal by two F 16 fighter jets  and they struck weapons and ammunition storage areas that were connected to the IRGC  The official said there had been Iranian aligned militia and IRGC personnel on the base and no civilians  but the U S  Does not have any information yet on casualties or an assessment of damage  The official would not say how many munitions were launched by the F 16s A senior defense official said the sites were chosen because the IRGC stores the types of munitions there that were used in the strikes against U S  Bases and troops  The two officials briefed reporters after the strikes on condition of anonymity to provide details on the mission that had not yet been made public According to the Pentagon  there have now been at least 19 attacks on U S  Bases and personnel in Iraq and Syria since Oct  17  including three new ones Thursday  Air Force Brig  Gen  Pat Ryder said 21 U S  Personnel were injured in two of those assaults that used drones to target al Asad Airbase in Iraq and al Tanf Garrison in Syria In a statement  Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the “precision self defense strikes are a response to a series of ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against U S  Personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian backed militia groups that began on October 17 ”He said President Joe Biden directed the narrowly tailored strikes “to make clear that the United States will not tolerate such attacks and will defend itself  its personnel  and its interests ” And he added that the operation was separate and distinct from Israel s war against Hamas The senior defense official told reporters that the F 16 airstrikes will have a significant impact on the ability of Iranian proxy groups to continue to attack U S  Forces  Asked what groups were targeted  the official said there are several that can have different names  but the U S  Holds Tehran responsible for funding  arming  equipping and directing the proxies  The official said the airstrikes were not designed to expand the conflict in the region  but to compel Iran to direct the militia groups to cease the attacks on American bases and personnel The Biden administration has not accused Iran of having a direct role in the Oct  7 Hamas attack on Israel and has said it appears so far that Tehran was not aware of it beforehand  But the U S  Has noted that Iran has long supported Hamas and has raised concerns that Iran and its proxies could turn the conflict into a wider war Austin said the U S  Does not seek a broader conflict  but if Iranian proxy groups continue  the U S  Won t hesitate to take additional action to protect its forces According to the Pentagon  all the U S  Personnel hurt in the militant attacks received minor injuries and all returned to duty  In addition  a contractor suffered a cardiac arrest and died while seeking shelter from a possible drone attack The retaliatory strikes came as no surprise  Officials at the Pentagon and the White House have made it clear for the past week that the U S  Would respond  with Ryder saying again Thursday that it would be “at the time and place of our choosing ”“I think we ve been crystal clear that we maintain the inherent right of defending our troops and we will take all necessary measures to protect our forces and our interests overseas ” he told reporters during a Pentagon briefing earlier in the day Biden said Wednesday that he had warned Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  Iran s supreme leader  that if Tehran continues to “move against” U S  Forces in the Middle East  “we will respond ”The latest spate of strikes by the Iranian linked groups came in the wake of a deadly explosion at a Gaza hospital  triggering protests in a number of Muslim nations  The Israeli military has relentlessly attacked Gaza in retaliation for the devastating Hamas rampage in southern Israel nearly three weeks ago  but Israel has denied responsibility for the al Ahli hospital blast and the U S  Has said its intelligence assessment found that Tel Aviv was not to blame The U S   including the Pentagon  has repeatedly said any strike response by America would be directly tied to the attacks on the troops  and not connected to the war between Israel and Hamas  Such retaliation and strikes against Iranian targets in Syria after similar attacks on U S  Bases are routine In March  for example  the U S  Struck sites in Syria used by groups affiliated with Iran s Revolutionary Guard after an Iranian linked attack killed a U S  Contractor and wounded seven other Americans in northeast Syria  American F 15 fighter jets flying out of al Udeid Air Base in Qatar struck several locations around Deir el Zour U S  Officials have routinely stressed that the American response is designed to be proportional  and is aimed at deterring strikes against U S  Personnel who are focused on the fight against the Islamic State group U S  Officials have not publicly tied the recent string of attacks in Syria and Iraq to the violence in Gaza  but Iranian officials have openly criticized the U S  For providing weapons to Israel that have been used to strike Gaza  resulting in civilian death The Pentagon  meanwhile  has beefed up air defenses in the region to protect U S  Forces  The U S  Has said it is sending several batteries of Patriot missile systems  a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense  THAAD  battery and additional fighter jets The THAAD is being sent from Fort Bliss  Texas  and the Patriot batteries are from Fort Liberty in North Carolina and Fort Sill in Oklahoma  An Avenger air defense system from Fort Liberty is also being sent Officials have said as much as two battalions of Patriots are being deployed  A battalion can include at least three Patriot batteries  which each have six to eight launchers Ryder said Thursday that about 900 troops have deployed or are in the process of going to the Middle East region  including those associated with the air defense systems        The Indian embassy at Tel Aviv and the Representative Office of India in Palestine on Saturday issued advisories asking Indian nationals in respective countries to “remain vigilant” and “directly contact the Office” in case of emergency as a full fledged war broke out between the ruling Hamas militant group in the Gaza Strip and Israel killing at least 498 people from both sides As they entered southern Israel by land  sea and air  using paragliders  Hamas militants fired more than 2 000 rockets from the Gaza Strip into Israel  according to the Israeli military  Hamas says it captured several Israeli soldiers near the border The surprise attack has killed 200 people and injured more than 1 100 in Israel  In the Gaza Strip side  there were 198 dead and about 1 500 wounded in Israel s counterattack  media reports said        The surprise and unprecedented multifront attack – by air  land and sea – by the Hamas militant group in southern Israel from the Gaza Strip is a result of a  colossal failure  of the country s intelligence agencies  according to media reports and experts Militants from Hamas  which rules the Gaza Strip  fired more than 3 000 rockets from the Gaza Strip into Israel on Saturday morning  according to the Israeli military  while Hamas fighters entered southern Israel by land  sea and air  using paragliders and even captured several Israeli soldiers near the border At least 350 Israelis  including soldiers  have been killed and more than 1 900 injured in Israel   the deadliest day for the country in at least 50 years  On the Gaza Strip side  there are nearly 300 deaths and about 1 500 wounded in Israel’s counterattack  media reports said on Sunday        The European Union began taking steps on Thursday to limit the impact of the war between Israel and Hamas on the bloc  amid heightened security tensions after a firebomb attack on a Berlin synagogue and killings in Belgium and France by suspected Islamic extremists Spain  which currently holds the EU s rotating presidency  activated a crisis mechanism to speed up decision making and coordination between the 27 member countries  the bloc s institutions and major partners like the United Nations or the United States Officials from across the EU have expressed concerns about a rise in anti semitic attacks  radicalization online  the use of encrypted messaging services by extremists  and the need to speed up the deportation of people who might pose a public danger But calls for an increase in security across the board are creating deep unease as the solutions being discussed could undermine free movement and the right to assemble in Europe Italy is introducing border checks to counter a possible rise in tensions over the Israel Hamas war  Denmark and Sweden are too  due to what they have said is a terrorist threat  France intends to keep checks in place until at least May 2024  citing “new terrorist threats and external borders situation ”More police have been deployed in Belgium  France and Germany EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell believes part of the solution to Europe s security woes must involve the bloc helping diplomatically and financially to bring an end to years of conflict between Israel and the Palestinians “We have learned from history that the most difficult decisions are always taken when we are on the edge of the abyss  I believe that is where we are now  on the edge of the abyss ” Borrell told EU lawmakers on Wednesday “When I hear Muslim religious authorities speaking the language of inter religious conflict and explicitly stating that Europe is a party to this conflict  I feel that the storm clouds are looming ” he said Still  not all of Europe s challenges are directly linked to the war Earlier on Thursday  Sweden hosted a meeting of ministers from eight countries  among them Germany  Belgium and France  focused on how to handle incidents where people burn the Muslim holy book  the Quran Prosecutors are trying to establish whether that was a key motive for a Tunisian man to shoot three Swedes in Brussels on Monday  killing two of them  ahead of a Belgium Sweden soccer match in the capital While the Quran burnings are not directly linked to the conflict between Israel and Hamas  they are a sign of rising tensions between religious and other communities in Europe The war that began October 7 has become the deadliest of five Gaza wars for both sides  More than 5 000 people have been killed in Israel and Gaza  Nearly 12 500 Palestinians have been wounded  and over 200 people in Israel taken hostage “We have to address multiple impacts from the continuing crisis in the Middle East  in the EU  European Commission Vice President Margaritis Schinas said “This entails the protection of our Jewish communities  but also the protection against a generalised climate of Islamophobia that has no place in our society ” he told reporters in Luxembourg  where EU interior ministers were meeting Pro Palestinian rallies have been held in several European cities since the war  France has banned them  Germany has also promised to take tougher action against Hamas  which is already on the EU s list of terrorist organizations Chancellor Olaf Scholz told the German parliament that local authorities “must not allow gatherings … at which it must be feared that anti semitic slogans will be shouted  that people s deaths will be glorified and everything we can t accept here ”In France  the Palace of Versailles   a major tourist attraction   and three airports were evacuated for security reasons and temporarily closed Wednesday  The incidents were the latest in a spate of evacuations in the past five days  and the French government is threatening to fine or jail prank callers They followed the killing of a teacher in northern France on Friday by a suspected Islamic extremist French Interior Minister Gerland Darmanin noted that two foreigners were behind the recent attacks in Belgium and France  and he insisted that long delayed reforms of EU asylum rules must be put in place Europe must “manage our borders  register people and conduct the security interviews that are necessary before every asylum request ” he told reporters The EU has agreements with Turkey and Tunisia to persuade them to prevent migrants reaching Europe   and take them back if they do get through   but they are not working well  Other deals  with Egypt notably  are planned        Noted Indian Americans  including two Republican presidential candidates Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy  have rallied behind Israel following unprecedented attacks on it by the Hamas militant group that has left hundreds dead Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a barrage of rocket attacks in southern Israel on Saturday  killing over 600 people  including soldiers  and wounding more than 1 900 The Israel Defense Forces  IDF  in response launched multiple airstrikes targeting Hamas  key infrastructure  About 1 000 people have been confirmed dead in Israel and Gaza in the biggest escalation in decades between the two sides “Hamas and the backers who support them  the Iranian regime  were chanting  Death to Israel  death to America   That s what we have to remember  We are united with Israel because Hamas  Hezbollah  the Houthis and the Iranian backers hate us   Republican presidential candidate Haley told NBC News on Sunday  We have to remember that what happened to Israel could happen here in America  And I hope that we all unite and stand with Israel because they really need us right now ” she said In a post on X  Haley told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to “finish them  Hamas ” Hamas is a Palestinian Islamist militant group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007  The Gaza Strip is home to about 2 3 million people  It is a 41km long and 10km wide territory surrounded by Israel  Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea Haley said she had introduced a resolution denouncing Hamas when she was the US ambassador to the UN “America was the only member of the Security Council to vote for it  This is what Israel is up against a world that denies the evil in front of them  We did not bow to world pressure then we won t now ” she said Other Indian American Republican candidate Ramaswamy said the key lesson for America to learn from the attack on Israel was that it cannot be complacent about defending its own borders  If it can happen there  it can happen here  Our own border is near completely porous right now  The Southern Border is a disaster and I visited the Northern Border yesterday which is wide open for invasion  Hamas picked a moment when Israel is deeply divided over domestic politics  as we are now here at home ” he said “Our own foreign policy establishment has focused on distant foreign priorities while leaving us badly vulnerable on border defence  cyber and super EMP defence  nuclear missile defence  and space based defences  We can t lose sight of that and should use the attacks on Israel as a wake up call here at home ” Ramaswamy said on Sunday Mukesh Aghi  president and CEO of US India Strategic and Partnership Forum  USISPF  posted on social media platform X on Sunday  “I stand with Israel” with the flag of India in the backdrop Bharat Barai  Indian Indian American community leader  said Hamas and Hezbollah are the most barbaric terrorist organisations in the world “Israel has every right to destroy this brutal terrorist outfit for attacking Israel  murdering  abducting  raping and torturing innocent Israeli citizens  The entire civilised world must condemn Hamas and other similar barbarians ” he said The terrorist attacks by Hamas on the people of Israel are absolutely  horrific   said community leader Ajay Jain Bhutoria “I stand with Israel in its unwavering right to defend itself  My prayers are with the dead  reported hostages  and hundreds injured and all affected by these horrific attacks  I strongly condemn the terrorist attacks against Israel ” he said “These acts of violence are completely unacceptable  We stand with Israel and fully support its right to defend itself  Our thoughts are with everyone affected by this  Civilian innocent life must be protected on both sides including in Palestine ” Bhutoria said Indian American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi said the United States “unequivocally” stands with the people of Israel against this  gruesome  terror attack and strongly supports its right to defend itself Sunday s war crimes carried out by Hamas against Israeli women and children were inhuman and appalling  said Indian American Congressman Ro Khanna “My heart breaks for the victims  and I stand in solidarity with the people of Israel at this dark moment ” he said Strongly condemning the terrorist attack by Hamas  Indian American Congressman Dr Ami Bera said that it is more important than ever that the United States stands with Israel and its right to defend its sovereignty “America stands firmly with Israel ” said Indian American Congressman Shri Thanedar  adding that Congress must rally behind Israel until this threat is addressed and security is restored        Nearly three dozen trucks entered Gaza in the largest aid convoy since the war between Israel and Hamas began  but humanitarian workers said the assistance still fell desperately short of needs after thousands of people broke into warehouses to take flour and basic hygiene products The Gaza Health Ministry said on Sunday the death toll among Palestinians passed 8 000  mostly women and minors  as Israeli tanks and infantry pursued what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called a “second stage” in the war ignited by Hamas  brutal October 7 incursion  The toll is without precedent in decades of Israeli Palestinian violence  Over 1 400 people have died on the Israeli side  mainly civilians killed during the initial attack  also an unprecedented figure Communications were restored to most of Gaza s 2 3 million people Sunday after an Israeli bombardment described by residents as the most intense of the war knocked out phone and internet services late Friday Israel has allowed only a trickle of aid to enter  On Sunday  33 trucks carrying water  food and medicine entered the only border crossing from Egypt  a spokesperson at the Rafah crossing  Wael Abo Omar  told The Associated Press After visiting the Rafah crossing  the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court called the suffering of civilians “profound  and said he had not been able to enter Gaza  “These are the most tragic of days ” said Karim Khan  whose court has been investigating the actions of Israeli and Palestinian authorities since 2014 Khan called on Israel to respect international law but stopped short of accusing it of war crimes  He called Hamas  October 7 attack a serious violation of international humanitarian law  “The burden rests with those who aim the gun  missile or rocket in question ” he said The Israeli military said Sunday that it had struck more than 450 militant targets over the past 24 hours  including Hamas command centers and anti tank missile launching positions  Huge plumes of smoke rose over Gaza City  Military spokesman Rear Adm  Daniel Hagari said dozens of militants were killed Hagari  who said ground operations were intensifying  also reiterated calls for Gaza residents to move south  saying they d have better access to food  water and medicine there “This is a matter of urgency ” he said Israel says most Gaza residents have heeded its orders to flee to the southern part of the besieged territory  but hundreds of thousands remain in the north  in part because Israel has also bombarded targets in so called safe zones  More than 1 4 million people in Gaza have fled their homes The Hamas military wing said its militants clashed with Israeli troops who entered the northwest Gaza Strip with small arms and anti tank missiles  Palestinian militants have continued firing rockets into Israel  including toward its commercial hub  Tel Aviv The aid warehouse break ins were “a worrying sign that civil order is starting to break down after three weeks of war and a tight siege on Gaza   said Thomas White  Gaza director for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees  known as UNRWA   People are scared  frustrated and desperate ”UNRWA spokesperson Juliette Touma said the crowds broke into four facilities on Saturday  She said the warehouses did not contain any fuel  which has been in critically short supply since Israel cut off all shipments  Israel says Hamas would use it for military purposes and that the militant group is hoarding large fuel stocks for itself in the territory  That claim couldn t be independently verified One warehouse held 80 tons of food  the U N  World Food Program said  It emphasized that at least 40 of its trucks need to cross into Gaza daily just to meet growing food needs President Joe Biden in a call with Netanyahu on Sunday “underscored the need to immediately and significantly increase the flow of humanitarian assistance to meet the needs of civilians in Gaza ” the US said Israeli authorities said they would soon allow more humanitarian aid to enter Gaza But the head of civil affairs at COGAT  the Israeli defense body responsible for Palestinian civilian affairs  provided no details on how much aid would be available  Elad Goren also said Israel has opened two water lines in southern Gaza within the past week  The AP could not independently verify that either line was functioning Meanwhile  crowded hospitals in Gaza came under growing threat  Residents living near Shifa Hospital  the territory s largest  said Israeli airstrikes overnight hit near the complex where tens of thousands of civilians are sheltering  Israel accuses Hamas of having a secret command post beneath the hospital but has not provided much evidence  Hamas denies the allegations The Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service said nearby Israeli airstrikes damaged parts of another Gaza City hospital after it received two calls from Israeli authorities on Sunday ordering it to evacuate  Some windows were blown out  and rooms were covered in debris  The rescue service said airstrikes have hit as close as 50 meters  yards  from the Al Quds Hospital where 14 000 people are sheltering Israel ordered the hospital to evacuate more than a week ago  but it and other medical facilities have refused  saying evacuation would mean death for patients on ventilators “Under no circumstances  hospitals should be bombed ” the director general of the International Committee of the Red Cross  Robert Mardini  told CBS  “Face the Nation  About 20 000 people were sheltering at Nasser Hospital  emergency director Dr  Mohammed Qandeel said  “I brought my kids to sleep here ” said one displaced resident who gave her name only as Umm Ahmad  “I used to be afraid of my kids playing in the sand  Now their hands are dirty with the blood on the floor ”An Israeli airstrike hit a two story house in Khan Younis on Sunday  killing at least 13 people  including 10 from one family  The bodies were brought to the nearby Nasser Hospital  according to an AP journalist at the scene The military escalation has increased domestic pressure on Israel s government to secure the release of some 230 hostages seized by Hamas fighters during the October 7 attack Hamas says it is ready to release all hostages if Israel releases all of the thousands of Palestinians held in its prisons  Desperate family members of the Israeli captives met with Netanyahu on Saturday and expressed support for an exchange  Israel has dismissed the Hamas offer “If Hamas does not feel military pressure  nothing will move forward ” Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told families of the hostages Sunday The Israeli military has stopped short of calling its gradually expanding ground operations inside Gaza an all out invasion  Casualties on both sides are expected to rise sharply as Israeli forces and Palestinian militants battle in dense residential areas Israel says it targets Hamas fighters and infrastructure and that the militants operate among civilians  putting them in danger The violence has inflicted serious damage on Gaza s civilian infrastructure  The territory s sole power plant shut down shortly after the war began  Hospitals are struggling to keep emergency generators running to operate incubators and other life saving equipment  and UNRWA is trying to keep water pumps and bakeries running  As water ran short  some Gazans bathed in the sea The fighting has raised concerns that the violence could spread across the region  Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah have engaged in daily skirmishes along Israel s northern border  Hagari said Israel on Sunday struck three militant cells that fired from Lebanon into Israel and killed militants who were trying to enter  Hamas said its forces in Lebanon fired 16 missiles at the Israeli city of Nahariya  Hezbollah  a Hamas ally  said it also fired missiles at several sites The Israeli military said Sunday night that rockets from Syria fell in open Israeli territory  It did not report any injuries Roughly 250 000 Israelis have been evacuated from their homes because of violence along the border with Gaza and the northern border with Lebanon  according to the Israeli military        President Joe Biden

would begin Gaza s overwhelmed hospitals tried to stretch out ebbing medical supplies and fuel for generators  as authorities worked out logistics for a desperately needed aid delivery from Egypt  Doctors in darkened wards across Gaza performed surgeries by the light of mobile phones and used vinegar to treat infected wounds Amid the violence  President Joe Biden pledged unwavering support for Israel s security  “today and always ” while adding that the world “can t ignore the humanity of innocent Palestinians  in the besieged Gaza Strip In an address Thursday night from the Oval office  hours after returning to Washington from an urgent visit to Israel  Biden drew a distinction between ordinary Palestinians and Hamas  the militant group that controls Gaza  He linked the current war in Gaza to the Russian invasion of Ukraine  saying Hamas and Russian President Vladimir Putin  both want to completely annihilate a neighbouring democracy ”Biden said he was sending an “urgent budget request” to Congress on Friday  to cover emergency military aid to both Israel and Ukraine Meanwhile  an unclassified US intelligence assessment delivered to Congress estimated casualties in an explosion at a Gaza City hospital this week on the “low end” of 100 to 300 deaths  The death toll “still reflects a staggering loss of life ” US intelligence officials said in the report  seen by The Associated Press  It said intelligence officials were still assessing the evidence and their casualty estimate may evolve Biden and other US officials already have said that US intelligence officials believe the explosion at al Ahli Hospital was not caused by an Israeli airstrike  Thursday s findings echoed that The Israeli military has relentlessly attacked Gaza in retaliation for the devastating Oct  7 Hamas rampage in southern Israel  Even after Israel told Palestinians to evacuate the north of Gaza and flee south  strikes extended across the territory  heightening fears among the territory s 2 3 million people that nowhere was safe Palestinian militants fired rockets into Israel from Gaza and Lebanon  and tensions flared in the Israeli occupied West Bank In a fiery speech to Israeli infantry soldiers on the Gaza border  Defense Minister Yoav Gallant urged the forces to “get organized  be ready” to move in  Israel has massed tens of thousands of troops along the border “Whoever sees Gaza from afar now  will see it from the inside   he said  “It might take a week  a month  two months until we destroy them ” he added  referring to Hamas Israel s consent for Egypt to let in food  water and medicine provided the first possible opening in its seal of the territory  Many Gaza residents are down to one meal a day and drinking dirty water Egypt and Israel were still negotiating the entry of fuel for hospitals  Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm  Daniel Hagari said Hamas has stolen fuel from UN facilities and Israel wants assurances that won t happen  The first trucks of aid were expected to go in Friday With the Egypt Gaza border crossing in Rafah closed  the already dire conditions at Gaza s second largest hospital deteriorated further  said Dr Mohammed Qandeel of Nasser Hospital in the southern town of Khan Younis  Power was shut off in most of the hospital and medical staff were using mobile phones for light At least 80 wounded civilians and 12 dead flooded into the hospital after witnesses said a strike hit a residential building in Khan Younis  Doctors had no choice but to leave two to die because there were no ventilators  Qandeel said “We can t save more lives if this keeps happening ” he said The Gaza Health Ministry pleaded with gas stations to give fuel to hospitals and a U N  Agency donated some of its last fuel The agency s donation to Gaza City s Shifa Hospital  the territory s largest  would “keep us going for another few hours ” hospital director Mohammed Abu Selmia said Al Ahli Hospital was still recovering from Tuesday s explosion  which remains a point of dispute between Hamas and Israel  Hamas quickly said an Israeli airstrike hit the hospital  which Israel denied  The AP has not independently verified any of the claims or evidence released by the parties The blast left body parts strewn on the hospital grounds  where crowds of Palestinians had clustered in hopes of escaping Israeli airstrikes  The US assessment noted “only light structural damage ” with no impact crater visible Near al Ahli  meanwhile  another explosion struck a Greek Orthodox church housing displaced Palestinians late Thursday  resulting in deaths and dozens of wounded  Abu Selmia  the Shifa Hospital director general  said dozens were hurt at the Church of Saint Porphyrios but could not give a precise death toll because bodies were buried under rubble Palestinian authorities blamed the blast on an Israeli airstrike  a claim that could not be independently verified  The Greek Orthodox Patriarchy of Jerusalem condemned the attack and said it would “not abandon its religious and humanitarian duty” to provide assistance The Gaza Health Ministry said 3 785 people have been killed in Gaza since the war began  the majority women  children and older adults  Nearly 12 500 were injured  and another 1 300 people were believed buried under rubble  authorities said More than 1 400 people in Israel have been killed  mostly civilians slain during Hamas  deadly incursion  Roughly 200 others were abducted  The Israeli military said Thursday it had notified the families of 203 captives More than 1 million Palestinians  about half of Gaza s population  have fled their homes in the north since Israel told them to evacuate  crowding into U N  run schools turned shelters or the homes of relatives For the first time since Israel captured Gaza from Egypt in 1967  a major tent camp arose to house displaced people  Dozens of U N  provided tents lined a dirt lot in Khan Younis The deal to get aid into Gaza through Rafah  the territory s only connection to Egypt  remained fragile  Israel said the supplies could only go to civilians and that it would “thwart” any diversions by Hamas  Biden said the deliveries “will end” if Hamas takes any aid More than 200 trucks and some 3 000 tons of aid were positioned at or near Rafah  according to Khalid Zayed  the head of the Red Crescent for North Sinai Under an arrangement reached between the United Nations  Israel and Egypt  U N  Observers will inspect the trucks before entering Gaza  The U N   working with the Egyptian and Palestinian Red Crescent  will ensure aid goes only to civilians  an Egyptian official and European diplomat told the AP  A UN flag will be raised on both sides of the crossing as a sign of protection against airstrikes  said the officials  who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media It was not immediately clear how much cargo the crossing could handle  Waleed Abu Omar  spokesperson for the Palestinian side  said work has not started to repair the road damaged by Israeli airstrikes Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry told Al Arabiya TV that foreigners and dual nationals would be allowed to leave Gaza once the crossing was opened Israel said it agreed to allow aid from Egypt because of a request by Biden   which followed days of intense talks with the US secretary of state to overcome staunch Israeli refusal Israel had previously said it would let nothing into Gaza until Hamas freed the hostages taken from Israel  Relatives of some of the captives were furious over the aid announcement “The Israeli government pampers the murderers and kidnappers ” the Hostage and Missing Families Forum said The Israeli military said Thursday it killed a top Palestinian militant in Rafah and hit hundreds of targets across Gaza  including militant tunnel shafts  intelligence infrastructure and command centres  Palestinians have launched barrages of rockets at Israel since the fighting began Violence was also escalating in the West Bank  where Israel carried out a rare airstrike Thursday  targeting militants in the Nur Shams refugee camp Six Palestinians were killed  the Palestinian Health Ministry said  and the Israeli military said the strike killed militants and resulted in 10 Israeli officers being wounded  More than 74 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the war started        The United States on Friday expanded its effort to cut off funding for Hamas  announcing a second round of sanctions against people and organisations linked to the group since it launched an attack on Israel that killed more than 1 400 people The new sanctions highlight Iran s role in providing financial  logistical and operational support to Hamas  the US Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Control said in a statement They include a Hamas representative in Iran and members of Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guard The sanctions were announced as Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo travelled to London to shore up support from Britain  one of America s closest allies  for the drive to squeeze off funding for Hamas  which both countries consider a terrorist organisation “Today s action underscores the United States  commitment to dismantling Hamas s funding networks by deploying our counterterrorism sanctions authorities and working with our global partners to deny Hamas the ability to exploit the international financial system ” Adeyemo said Among those targeted are Khaled Qaddoumi  described as a liaison between Hamas and the Iranian government  and Ali Morshed Shirazi and Mostafa Mohammad Khani  officials in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps  Qods Force who are accused of training and assisting Hamas fighters The US also sanctioned a number of organisations  including the Iranian Bonyad Shahid  also known as the Martyrs Foundation  US officials say the group  which is affiliated with Palestinian Islamic Jihad  funnels millions of dollars through the Gaza based Al Ansar Charity Association for the families of militants The practice “ultimately serves as a recruiting tool for terrorist activities”  the US said The sanctions freeze any US based assets owned or controlled by the named individuals and organisations  They also block financial transactions with those designated and prohibit the contribution of funds  goods and services to them        President Joe Biden said Friday he thought Hamas was motivated to attack Israel in part by a desire to stop that country from normalising relations with Saudi Arabia “One of the reasons Hamas moved on Israel … they knew that I was about to sit down with the Saudis ” Biden said at a fundraising event  The US president indicated that he thinks Hamas militants launched a deadly assault on October 7 because  “Guess what  The Saudis wanted to recognise Israel” and were near being able to formally do so Jerusalem and Riyadh had been steadily inching closer to normalization  with Biden working to help bring the two countries together  announcing plans in September at the Group of 20 summit in India to partner on a shipping corridor Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Biden on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in September and told him  “I think that under your leadership  Mr President  we can forge a historic peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia ”The Saudis had been insisting on protection and expanded rights for Palestinian interests as part of any broader agreement with Israel  An agreement would have been a feat of diplomacy that could have enabled broader recognition of Israel by other Arab and Muslim majority nations that have largely opposed Israel since its creation 75 years ago in territory where Palestinians have long resided But talks were interrupted after Hamas militants stormed from the blockaded Gaza Strip where Palestinians live into nearby Israeli towns The October 7 attack coincided with a major Jewish holiday  It led to retaliatory airstrikes by Israel that have left the world on edge with the US trying to keep the war from widening  as 1 400 Israelis and 4 137 Palestinians have been killed  Hamas also captured more than 200 people as hostages after the initial assault        Israel on Tuesday bombed areas of southern Gaza where it had told Palestinians to flee to ahead of an expected invasion  killing dozens of people Meanwhile  mediators struggled to break a deadlock over delivering aid to millions of increasingly desperate civilians in the territory  which has been besieged and under assault by Israel since a brutal attack by Hamas militants Flaring violence along Israel s border with Lebanon also led to concerns over a widening regional conflict that diplomats were working to prevent In Gaza  people wounded in the airstrikes were rushed to the hospital after heavy attacks outside the southern Gaza cities of Rafah and Khan Younis  residents reported  Basem Naim  a senior Hamas official and former health minister  reported 27 people were killed in Rafah and 30 in Khan Younis An Associated Press reporter saw around 50 bodies brought to Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis  Family members came to claim the bodies  wrapped in white bedsheets  some soaked in blood An airstrike in Deir al Balah reduced a house to rubble  killing nine members of the family living there  Three members of another family that had evacuated from Gaza City were killed in a neighbouring home  The dead included one man and 11 women and children  Witnesses said there was no warning before the strike The Israeli military said it was targeting Hamas hideouts  infrastructure and command centers “When we see a target  when we see something moving that is Hamas  we ll take care of it  We ll handle it   said Lt Col Richard Hecht  an Israeli military spokesman Israel has sealed off and bombed Hamas ruled Gaza since the militant attack on southern Israel Oct  7 killed over 1 400 people  mostly civilians  and left about 200 captive in Gaza Israeli strikes have killed at least 2 778 people and wounded 9 700 others in Gaza  according to the Health Ministry  Nearly two thirds of the dead were children  said Medhat Abbas  a Gaza Health Ministry official  The strikes have not stopped Hamas militants from continuing to barrage Israel with rockets launched from Gaza Another 1 200 people across Gaza are believed buried under the rubble  alive or dead  health authorities said  Emergency teams struggled to rescue people while cut off from the internet and mobile networks  running out of fuel and exposed to unceasing airstrikes On Monday Israeli warplanes struck the headquarters of the Civil Defence in Gaza City  killing seven paramedics  Another 10 medics and doctors have been killed on the job  health authorities said Israel has massed troops at the border for an expected ground offensive  but Hecht said Tuesday no concrete decisions have been made  These plans are being developed  They will be decided by  and presented to  our political leadership   he said Airstrikes  dwindling supplies  and Israel s mass evacuation order for the north of the Gaza Strip has thrown the tiny territory s 2 3 million people into upheaval and desperation More than 1 million Palestinians have fled their homes  and 60% are now in the approximately 14 kilometre  8 mile  long area south of the evacuation zone  the UN said Aid workers warned that the territory was near complete collapse as hospitals were on the verge of losing electricity  threatening the lives of thousands of patients  and hundreds of thousands of people searched for bread and water Some departments in Gaza s only specialised cancer hospital stopped working because of fuel shortages and the remaining wards will run out within two days  according to a statement from Sobhi Skik  director general of the Turkish Friendship Hospital At the Rafah crossing  Gaza s only connection to Egypt  truckloads of aid were waiting to go into the tiny  densely populated territory  and trapped civilians with foreign citizenship   many of them Palestinians with dual nationalities   were hoping desperately to get out Mediators were trying to reach a cease fire to open the border  which shut down last week after Israeli airstrikes  An agreement appeared to have been reached Monday  but Israel denied reports of a cease fire in Rafah  which would be needed to open the gates  On Tuesday morning  they were still closed An Egyptian official said Tuesday that Egypt and Israel agreed that the aid convoys at the border would travel into Israel for inspection at the Kerem Shalom crossing between Gaza and Israel The aid would then be allowed into Gaza  A brief humanitarian cease fire would take place and foreign nationals would be allowed to exit Gaza via Rafah  the official said  speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to speak with the media Both Hamas and Israel cast doubt on an immediate opening  The crossings are closed  and I m not aware of a truce or stop of hostilities   Hecht said Wael Abu Omar  Hamas  spokesman for the Rafah crossing  said   Up until now  there is no agreement  The World Food Programme said it had more than 300 tons of food waiting to cross into Gaza   No one is giving up on the hope that this  crossing  would be open   said WFP official Abeer Etefa US Secretary of State Antony Blinken  who visited Israel for the second time in a week on Monday after a six country tour through Arab nations  said in Tel Aviv that the US and Israel had agreed to develop a plan to enable humanitarian aid to reach civilians in Gaza  There were few details  but the plan would include “the possibility of creating areas to help keep civilians out of harm s way” Gen Erik Kurilla  the head of US Central Command  arrived in Tel Aviv for meetings with Israeli military authorities ahead of a Biden visit planned for Wednesday to signal White House support for Israel  Biden will also travel to Jordan to meet with Arab leaders amid fears the fighting could expand into a broader regional conflict Israel evacuated towns near its northern border with Lebanon  where the military has exchanged fire repeatedly with the Iranian backed Hezbollah group The military said it killed four militants wearing explosive vests who were attempting to cross into the country from Lebanon on Tuesday morning  Video from a reconnaissance drone the army shared showed the militants near the border wall before they were targeted  causing an explosion  No group immediately claimed responsibility “Whoever approaches the border with Lebanon will be killed ” said Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari Israel has warned Lebanon it will strongly retaliate against attacks from across the border Israel fought a vicious month long war with Hezbollah in 2006 that ended in a stalemate and a tense detente between the two sides Iran s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned that Israel s continuing offensive in Gaza could cause a violent reaction across the region “Bombardments should be immediately stopped  Muslim nations are angry ” Khamenei said  according to state media Speaking to the Israeli Knesset on Monday  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Iran and Hezbollah  “Don t test us in the north  Don t make the mistake of the past  Today  the price you will pay will be far heavier  Soon after he spoke  the Knesset floor was evacuated as rockets headed toward Jerusalem  Sirens in Tel Aviv prompted US and Israeli officials to take shelter in a bunker  officials said The Israeli military said Monday at least 199 hostages were taken into Gaza  more than previously estimated  Hamas said it was holding 200 to 250 hostages Hamas  military wing released a hostage video showing a dazed woman having her arm wrapped with bandages  The woman  who identified herself as Mia Schem  21  rocked slightly as she spoke  the sound of explosions reverberating in the background The plight of the hostages has dominated the Israeli media since the attack  with interviews with their relatives playing on television almost constantly  Israeli officials have vowed to maintain the siege of Gaza until the hostages are released In Gaza  more than 400 000 displaced people in the south crowded into schools and other facilities of the UN agency for Palestinians  The agency said it has only 1 litre of water a day for each of its staff members trapped in the territory Israel opened a water line into the south for three hours that benefitted only 14 per cent of Gaza s population  the UN said        Actor Kangana Ranaut on Wednesday met Israeli Ambassador Naor Gilon and expressed confidence that the country will emerge victorious in its  war against terrorism  The actor  who is promoting her upcoming movie  Tejas   shared photos and a video of her interaction  in which she discussed the ongoing Israel Hamas conflict  with the Israeli ambassador on her official X account  Had a very soulful meeting with Israel s ambassador to India Shri Naor Gilon ji  Today the whole world  especially Israel and India  are fighting their war against terrorism  Yesterday when I reached Delhi for Ravana Dahan  I felt that I should come to Israel Embassy and meet the people who are defeating today s modern Ravana and terrorists like Hamas   Ranaut posted  referring to her participation at the national capital s famed Lav Kush Ramleela on Tuesday evening Earlier this month  Israel launched an attack on the Hamas controlled Gaza Strip after militants affiliated to the group killed hundreds  including civilians in large numbers  in an assault on the country  The way small children and women are being targeted is heart wrenching  I have full hope that Israel will be victorious in this war against terrorism  With him I discussed about my upcoming film  Tejas  and India s self reliant fighter aircraft Tejas  @IsraelinIndia   the 36 year old actor added In a follow up post  Ranaut shared the video of her interaction with Gilon  My heart goes out to Israel  Our hearts are bleeding too  Here s my conversation with Israel s ambassador to Bharat Naor Gilon   she wrote The Israeli ambassador thanked the actor for her support to his country  It was lovely meeting @KanganaTeam who was in Delhi for her movie premiere   visited our embassy to extend her support to @Israel  I expressed our heartfelt gratitude not only to her but also to PM @narendramodi ji and our Indian friends for their unwavering support in our shared battle against terrorism   Gilon wrote on his official X account Ranaut s upcoming movie  Tejas  is set to be released in theatres on Friday  The movie  written and directed by Sarvesh Mewara  features Ranaut in the role of an Indian Air Force pilot        Amid the intensifying Israel Hamas conflict  this analysis delves into the intricate web of historical  political  and humanitarian factors shaping the crisis  From the longstanding US support for Israel to the divide within American politics  it scrutinises the complex dynamics  As casualties rise and diplomatic efforts falter  the urgency for a resolution that balances security with justice becomes paramount on the global stageThe US’ support for Israel is unequivocal  It has been consistent since the creation of the Jewish State on May 14  1948  Washington is sticking to its long established script that provides all the grounds for standing for Israel  From day one of the current attack of the Hamas over Israel  President Joe Biden is repeatedly echoing the line in public that Israel has a “legitimate right to defend itself” This unquestionable support for Israel began with former President Harry Truman who became the first world leader to recognise the State of Israel  His decision was driven by two main considerations first being a personal one i e  his former business partner Edward Jacobson actually did all the foundational work to make the way for recognising the Jewish State by the UN in 1948  The second being a strategic perspective as Washington wanted to have a trusted ally in West Asia to spread its influence and to gradually counter the growing might of the USSR  Specifically  the US was using all its military  economic and diplomatic maneuvers to have major influence over the Suez Canal  the gateway to control strategic waterways and massive oil reserves in West Asian nations In the last more than five decades  America’s unequivocal support to Israel grew with its decisive victory over major Arab nations like Syria  Jordan  Egypt  etc  in 1967 and in 1973  This literally changed the equation in favour of Israel in the US Congress  During the reign of President Barack Obama  the US Government signed an agreement with Israel to send $38 billion military aid over a period of 10 years  including Iron Dome Missile System to the Zionist nation  Besides these tilts towards Israel  another powerful politically sensitive organisation called American Israel Public Affairs Committee  AIPAC  wields major influence over both the political parties and their top leaders But all is not well for Israel in the US  For a long time  progressive Democrats in the US have opposed the Jewish treatment of the Palestinians  Back in July of this year  the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a resolution pledging full support for the State of Israel  This resolution explicitly condemned anti Semitism and declared that the country is neither racist nor an apartheid nation  It is worth noting that all of this occurred just before the President of Israel was scheduled to address a joint session of Congress  This historic resolution once again delivered an implicit rebuke to the progressive Democrats who had been criticizing Israel for its decades long policies against Palestine On the record  Pramila Jayapal  the Democrat from Washington and the head of the Congressional Progressive Caucus  referred to Israel as a “Racist State”  but later she retracted her comments  Pramila also clarified that she is not contesting the idea of Israel  but rather its present government’s policies  The irony lies in the fact that  despite her frontal attack on the Israeli government and opposition to its policies  most Democrats supported the resolution put forth by the Republican Party And in the event of the current dastardly attack unleashed by Hamas over the Israeli state  the tensions between the moderate and progressive Democrats are sharply divided on Israel’s treatment of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and in the occupied West Bank region  The most powerful Republicans  and almost all the ordinary ones  are fully standing in solidarity with Israel at this hour of crisis  President Biden is trying to use this chaos as a re election strategy for the next year’s election campaign  aiming to impress both the hardliners and many Americans who are completely in favour of crushing Hamas and its dastardly acts against innocent civilians Some experts argue that the benefits of the US support for Israel no longer outweigh the costs  It has been a huge burden on the American exchequer  Once  the relationship between the US and Israel was justified both on moral and strategic grounds  The Jewish state readily offered an opportunity to America to influence the West Asian region after the Second World War Indeed  the establishment of Israel was projected as a befitting response to widespread anti Semitism in the West  particularly referring to the Holocaust under the tutelage of Adolf Hitler during the peak of the War  But at the same time  the majority in the West led by the US simply ignored the reality that the Arabs who had lived in Palestine for centuries had finally lost their indigenous land What has been failed to project by Washington is Israel’s military prowess and advantage from all fronts over Palestine and its people  It is a war between David and Goliath  And on top of that Israel is fully backed by the military machine of the US  the world’s most powerful nation  So one can easily imagine what will be the fate of the fighting Palestinians and the Hamas fighters For the first time  a US President visited Israel during the war  Not only Biden  but also his Secretary of State and Defense  Antony Blinken and Lloyd Austin respectively  landed in Israel between October 11 13  when hostilities were at their peak  Once they set the stage  President Biden came to Tel Aviv to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  demonstrating total solidarity with Israel Interestingly  after Biden’s visit on October 18  Israel was ready to allow humanitarian aid coming to the Gaza Strip The saddest part of the current quagmire is that innocent civilians are punished in the name of fighting the Hamas militants  When the Israeli Defence Forces  IDF  ordered more than a million people to evacuate from North Gaza to shift to South Gaza  all international humanitarian agencies warned of dire consequences   The International Committee of the Red Cross  ICRC  immediately raised an alarm of a humanitarian tragedy if million people have to vacate their homes within 24 hours as the deadline set by Israel  The intention was to launch ground offensive against the Hamas and to rescue more than 200 hostages it has taken from Israel on the day of the attack i e  Shabbat  the holy day of rest and recuperation  But then  Mahmoud Abbas  the President of the Palestinian Authority  clearly said that civilians should not vacate North Gaza  The reason behind this is that this will offer another opportunity to the Zionist state to recapture more Palestinian territories to push forward its ulterior motives And for Palestinians it could be the Second Nakba  catastrophe or cataclysm  as many of their older generations already experienced the First Nakba in 1948 during the creation of the Israeli state  The Nakba refers to displacement of thousands of Palestinians from their original homes to make way for the Jewish state  While ordering to evacuate  the Israeli State had stopped all the basic facilities like water  food  electricity  etc  to the Gaza enclave When the tragic hospital blast took the lives of more than 500 civilians and the daily death count continues to rise  how can the US and the West remain silent spectators to this horror  It is true that Hamas took the lives of more than 1 300 innocent people on October 7 while the Jewish community was celebrating their festival  This is simply unpardonable It is a criminal act on the part of Hamas which they had been planning for months to breach one of the world’s most sophisticated security and intelligence systems  According to records published on the UN website  the number of people killed in Gaza has now exceeded 5000  as reported by the de facto authorities there  Humanitarians are repeatedly calling for a ceasefire and for more aid convoys  Meanwhile  the Director General of the World Health Organization  WHO   Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus  issued a new appeal for “sustained safe passage” for medical essentials and fuels to keep health facilities open  Sadly  women and children make up more than 62 per cent of the fatalities  while more than 15 000 people have been injured since October 7 Now the pertinent question here is that is it justified for the US  the world’s oldest democracy and leader of the global liberal order to continue sending arms  ammunitions  man and materials to bolster the Israeli defence forces to pound more and lethal attacks on the Gaza Strip  Are its civilians responsible for what Hamas did on South Israel  After long and sustained appeals from UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and other human rights and humanitarian aid agencies  why has the Biden Administration either failed or purposefully escalated another war in West Asia It is not all justified on the part of the US to back Israel at this hour with its superior military equipment as it could exacerbate the war in an already chaotic West Asia  Nowhere the civilians of Gaza and west Bank are responsible for ghastly act of the Hamas and the current torture on them is absolutely uncalled for  Despite appeals from the UN and other international bodies  the US is spearheading the acts of aggression and providing all that Israel needs to win over the Hamas is nothing but its decade long agenda to stand behind the Jewish State  It does not vary depending on who comes to Washington  Finally Israel wins its favour from its big brother in the US  So the violence and long discrimination against the Palestinian people goes on The Israel Hamas war since October 7 is a grim reminder to the international community that violence only breeds more violence  It is time to halt war in favor of peace  We all need to bear in mind that this planet demands peace simply to serve the uncared for and the most vulnerable people all around Maybe  the Palestinian people will not be able to reclaim their homeland but they all have the fundamental right to have peace and claim over whatever territories they have as of today  It is clear that a two state solution may take longer than ever before looking at the current hostilities in place  Also  we all need to accept the fact that the way Hamas has displayed its might and brutality over innocent Israeli civilians will certainly not pave the way for an independent Palestine sooner or later  The writer is currently president of the Global Research Foundation        More than a million people have fled their homes in the besieged Gaza Strip in the past week  ahead of expected Israel invasion that seeks to eliminate Hamas  leadership after its deadly attack The enclave s food and water supplies are dwindling  and its hospitals are warning that they are on the verge of collapse Israeli forces  supported by a growing deployment of US warships in the region and the call up of some 360 000 reservists  positioned themselves along Gaza s border and drilled for what Israel said would be a broad campaign to dismantle the militant group Israel said it has already struck dozens of military targets  including command centres and rocket launchers  and also killed Hamas commanders Israeli officials have given no timetable for a ground incursion that aid groups warn could hasten a humanitarian crisis in the coastal Gaza enclave A week of blistering airstrikes have demolished entire neighbourhoods but failed to stem militant rocket fire into Israel The Gaza Health Ministry said 2 670 Palestinians have been killed and 9 600 wounded since the fighting erupted  more than in the 2014 Gaza war  which lasted over six weeks  That makes this the deadliest of the five Gaza wars for both sides More than 1 400 Israelis have died  the vast majority civilians killed in Hamas  October 7 assault At least 155 others  including children  were captured by Hamas and taken into Gaza  according to Israel  It s also the deadliest war for Israel since the 1973 conflict with Egypt and Syria About 500 000 people  nearly one quarter of Gaza s population  were taking refuge in United Nations schools and other facilities across the territory  where water supplies were dwindling  said Juliette Touma  spokesperson for the UN s Palestinian refugee agency “Gaza is running dry ” she said  The agency says an estimated 1 million people have been displaced in Gaza in a single week The US State Department said Secretary of State Antony Blinken would return to Israel on Monday after completing a frantic six country tour through Arab nations aimed at preventing the fighting from igniting a broader regional conflict President Joe Biden is also considering a trip to Israel  though no plans have been finalised  In a television interview on Sunday night  Biden  who has repeatedly proclaimed support for Israel  nonetheless said he thought it would be a “big mistake” for the country to reoccupy Gaza The same day  Israel s ambassadors to the US and UN said the country does not want an occupation  But Israel will do “whatever is needed to obliterate their  Hamas   capabilities”  ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan told CNN Fighting along Israel s border with Lebanon  which has flared since the start of the latest Gaza war  intensified Sunday with Hezbollah militants firing rockets and an anti tank missile  and Israel responding with airstrikes and shelling The Israeli military also reported shooting at one of its border posts  The fighting killed at least one person on the Israeli side and wounded several on both sides of the border An Israeli drone fired two missiles late Sunday at a hill west of the town of Kfar Kila in south Lebanon  the state run National News Agency reported  There were no casualties reported in the strikes  which hit near a Lebanese army centre Hezbollah said in a statement that it had fired rockets toward an Israeli military position in the northern border town of Shtula in retaliation for Israeli shelling that killed Reuters videographer Issam Abdallah on Friday and two Lebanese civilians on Saturday A Hezbollah spokeswoman said the increased strikes represented a “warning” and did not mean Hezbollah has decided to enter the war With the situation in Gaza growing increasingly desperate  the US named David Satterfield  the former US ambassador to Turkiye experienced in Mideast diplomacy  to be special envoy for Middle East humanitarian issues US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Sunday that Satterfield will focus on getting humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in Gaza Hospitals in Gaza are expected to run out of generator fuel within two days  endangering the lives of thousands of patients According to the UN Gaza s sole power plant shut down for lack of fuel after Israel completely sealed off the 40 kilometer  25 mile  long territory following the Hamas attack In Nasser Hospital  in the southern town of Khan Younis  intensive care rooms were packed with wounded patients  most of them children under the age of 3 Hundreds of people with severe blast injuries have come to the hospital  where fuel is expected to run out by Monday  said Dr  Mohammed Qandeel  a consultant at the critical care complex There were 35 patients in the ICU who require ventilators and another 60 on dialysis  If fuel runs out  “it means the whole health system will be shut down”  he said  as children moaned in pain in the background  “All these patients are in danger of death if the electricity is cut off  Dr  Hussam Abu Safiya  the head of pediatrics at the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza  said the facility did not evacuate despite Israeli orders  There were seven newborns in the ICU hooked up to ventilators  he said  Evacuating “would mean death for them and other patients under our care ”Ahmed Al Mandhari  the regional director of the World Health Organisation  said hospitals were able to move some mobile patients out of the north  but most patients can t be evacuated  he said Shifa hospital in Gaza City  the territory s largest  said it would bury 100 bodies in a mass grave as an emergency measure after its morgue overflowed  Tens of thousands of people seeking safety have gathered in the hospital compound Gaza was already in a humanitarian crisis due to a growing shortage of water and medical supplies caused by the Israeli siege “An unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding under our eyes ” said Philippe Lazzarini  the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees Sullivan told CNN that Israeli officials told him they had turned the water back on in southern Gaza  Israel s minister of energy and water  Israel Katz  said in a statement that water had been restored at one “specific point” in Gaza  A spokesman said the location was outside Khan Younis  Aid workers in Gaza said they had not yet seen evidence the water was back Israel has ordered more than 1 million Palestinians   almost half the territory s population   to move south  The military says it is trying to clear away civilians ahead of a major campaign against Hamas in the north  where it says the militants have extensive networks of tunnels  bunkers and rocket launchers Hamas urged people to stay in their homes  and the Israeli military released photos it said showed a Hamas roadblock preventing traffic from moving south Nevertheless  more than 600 000 people had evacuated the Gaza City area  said Israel s chief military spokesman  Rear Adm  Daniel Hagari The US has been trying to broker a deal to reopen Egypt s Rafah crossing with Gaza to allow Americans and other foreigners to leave and humanitarian aid amassed on the Egyptian side to be brought in  The crossing  which was closed because of airstrikes early in the war  has yet to reopen Israel has said the siege will only be lifted when the ca       Israel escalated its bombardment of targets in the Gaza Strip  the military said on Tuesday  ahead of an expected ground invasion against Hamas militants that the US fears could spark a wider conflict in the region  including attacks on American troops The stepped up attacks  and the rapidly rising death toll in Gaza  came as Hamas released two elderly Israeli women who were among the hundreds of hostages it captured during its devastating October 7 attack on towns in southern Israel Amid a flurry of diplomatic activity in Israel since the war started  French President Emmanuel Macron arrived in Tel Aviv on Tuesday  meeting with the families of others held hostage in Gaza before heading to talks with top Israeli officials Gaza s 2 3 million people have been running out of food  water and medicine since Israel sealed off the territory following the attack  A third small aid convoy entered Gaza on Monday carrying only a tiny fraction of the cargo aid groups say is necessary With Israel still barring the entry of fuel  the United Nations said aid distribution would soon grind to a halt when it can no longer fuel trucks inside Gaza  Hospitals overwhelmed by the wounded are struggling to keep generators running to power lifesaving medical equipment and incubators for premature babies The two freed hostages  85 year old Yocheved Lifshitz and 79 year old Nurit Cooper  were taken out of Gaza at the Rafah crossing into Egypt  where they were put into ambulances  according to footage shown on Egyptian TV  The women  along with their husbands  were snatched from their homes in the kibbutz of Nir Oz near the Gaza border  Their husbands  ages 83 and 84  were not released “While I cannot put into words the relief that she is now safe  I will remain focused on securing the release of my father and all those   some 200 innocent people   who remain hostages in Gaza ” Lifshitz  daughter  Sharone Lifschitz  said in a statement The women were freed days after an American woman and her teenage daughter  Hamas and other militants in Gaza are believed to have taken roughly 220 people  including an unconfirmed number of foreigners and dual citizens Lifschitz  an artist and academic in London who spells her name differently to her parents  told reporters last week that her parents were peace activists  and her father would drive to the Gaza border to take Palestinians to east Jerusalem for medical treatment Kindness  she said last week  could somehow save them “I grew up  you know  with all these Holocaust stories about how all my uncles  lives were saved because” of acts of kindness  she said “Do I want that to be the story here ” she asked  “Yeah ”On Monday  Hamas released a video showing the handover  with militants giving drinks and snacks to the dazed but composed women  and holding their hands as they are walked to Red Cross officials  Just before the video ends  Lifshitz reaches back to shake one militant s hand Around the same time  Israel s internal security service  Shin Bet  released a recording showing Hamas prisoners   most in clean prison uniforms  but one in a bloody t shirt and at least one wincing in pain   sitting handcuffed in drab offices talking about the October 7 attack  The men said they were under orders to kill young men  and kidnap women  children and the elderly  and that they d been promised financial rewards The Associated Press could not independently verify either video  and both the hostages and the prisoners could have been acting under duress The fighting as killed more than 1 400 people in Israel   mostly civilians slain during the initial Hamas attack More than 5 000 Palestinians  including some 2 000 minors and around 1 100 women  have been killed  the Hamas run Health Ministry said  That includes the disputed toll from an explosion at a hospital last week  The toll has climbed rapidly in recent days  with the ministry reporting 436 additional deaths in just the last 24 hours On Tuesday  Israel said it had launched 400 airstrikes over the past day  killing Hamas commanders  hitting militants as they were preparing to launch rockets into Israel and striking command centers and a Hamas tunnel shaft  The previous day  Israel reported 320 strikes  The Palestinian official news agency  WAFA  said many of the airstrikes hit residential buildings  some of them in southern Gaza where Israel had told civilians to take shelter  causing many casualties and trapping people under rubble Fifteen members of the same family were among at least 33 Palestinians buried Monday in a shallow  sandy mass grave at a Gaza hospital after being killed in Israeli airstrikes Men discussed where to fit the shrouded corpse of a small child Israel says it does not target civilians and says Hamas militants are using them as cover for their attacks  Palestinian militants have fired over 7 000 rockets at Israel since the start of the war  Israel said Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas  Iranian backed fighters around the region are warning of possible escalation  including the targeting of US forces deployed in the Mideast  if a ground offensive is launched The US has told Iranian backed Hezbollah in Lebanon and other groups not to join the fight  Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire almost daily across the Israel Lebanon border  and Israeli warplanes have struck targets in Syria  Lebanon and the occupied West Bank in recent days National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said there has been an uptick in rocket and drone attacks by Iranian backed militias on US troops in Iraq and Syria  and the US was “deeply concerned about the possibility for any significant escalation” in the coming days He said US officials were having “active conversations” with Israeli counterparts about the potential ramifications of escalated military action The US advised Israeli officials that delaying a ground offensive would give Washington more time to work with regional mediators on the release of more hostages  according to a US official  who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were authorized to reveal sensitive negotiations At least 1 4 million Palestinians in Gaza have fled their homes  and nearly 580 000 of them are sheltering in UN run schools and shelters  the UN said Monday        Religiosity woven into war has the automatic effect of rendering the ensuing bloodshed all the more bitter  The results are devastatingThe world is used to the spectacle of scholars  academics and social and political activists propagating and conferencing for global peace  but it is increasingly difficult to dismiss the notion that peace is little more than an uneasy halt between wars  While civilians somehow cling to some unreal hope  those in charge of the political destinies talk of peace  but actually build and sharpen the weaponry for the next bout In the land of origin of the three Abrahamic faiths  Judaism  Christianity and Islam  peace is currently the biggest casualty  Virtually everyone is concerned about the Israel Hamas war  One  however  does almost immediately ponder as to how Tel Aviv was caught by utter surprise  Needless to add  the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad has been reputed to be one of the most efficient in the world  possibly the best spy agency On balance  it appears that Hamas was conscious that there are groups within Israel that desire the Jewish homeland and country to further expand into a Greater Israel  as large and great as possible  Undoubtedly  the Hamas leaders themselves yearn to wipe the Jewish nation out of existence  Curiously  like in love  so in hate  such desires are mutual  With the help of friends and allies  it is likely that Hamas has been  for a long time planning to strike a ‘grand slam’ at their Jewish neighbour Just as the Israeli leaders would like to get rid of Hamas from the country’s neighbourhood  All of this lays the grounds for a conflict before the end of which the other side would supposedly be wiped out  A wounded enemy is more dangerous than one who hasn’t been wounded  A grand slam  so to say  might have been thought to be necessary  The question is whether Israel too sees the Hamas invasion and barbarity as a great opportunity for “setting things right” in the Middle East An organized state in Tel Aviv would certainly be functioning round the clock and would not give its adversaries any chance to destroy it  As luck would have it  Hamas perceived that its Jewish neighbour was divided over the political divide over the issue of judicial powers enjoyed by the country’s Supreme Court  They needed to be reduced or restrained so that the democratically elected Knesset or Parliament could assert its will more effectively While the members of the Knesset could not readily reach a settlement  the people of the country took over and protested through public meetings and processions  Such scenes had not been seen ever before and were being played out again and again  on the streets of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem  When the adversary is divided  it is human nature for the other side to smell an opportunity As we have discussed  the desire of Hamas has been intense  The images of an Israel divided in the streets of its cities would certainly have held out the temptation  to believe that this was the opportunity  A terrorist organization like Hamas is unlikely to be foresighted  In fact  terrorism per se can seldom win  For the simple reason that its adventures  however violent and apparently successful  do not capture territory  And without territory  there is no lasting victory  And yet  terrorist after terrorist gives up his life  merely to temporarily devastate places and people  Evidently  such men or women cannot be far sighted  To expect the Hamas to be  therefore  to have vision is to expect a bat to have eyesight  Regardless  the attacks launched by Hamas on October 7 Bloody Saturday were thoughtless  to say the least  The consequences from Sunday onwards were foreseeable and yet  were not seen by the terrorist fighters of Hamas  It is not impossible that their escape route may  in an eventuality  be the Mediterranean Sea On the other hand  Hamas has gifted Israel with a justification to blame any country or organisation it chooses as a partner in crime that expresses even minimal sympathy for Hamas  Israel would also  and not without reason  feel justified to heap destruction on not any the Hamas but also the palaces of Qatar  which reportedly funds Hamas to some extent  and Iran’s nuclear toys  as well as bomb places in Syria  most of which are in ruins anyway because of the latter’s civil war  Fortunately for Israel  ammunition has begun flying in from the USA  if necessary  even weapons would flow in  When Israel’s Prime Minister says that his country will change the Middle East  he isn’t bluffing Unfortunately  Israel and India too has been battling enemies who look upon war as a religious duty  Religiosity woven into war has the automatic effect of rendering the ensuing bloodshed all the more bitter  Such religious beliefs hold the promise of an eternal heaven with unending gratification of one’s natural lust  in the pursuit of which the adherents of those dogmas have little hesitation in unleashing hell on earth For India  tightening our security  internal and external  in the wake of the war in Gaza will be imperative  for Hamas’ initial boldness could well embolden elements in Pakistan to try something similar  This time  the Arab states have not supported Hamas  as several of them are seeking better relations with Israel and a different future  The writer is a well known columnist  an author  and a former member of the Rajya Sabha  The views expressed are personal        For Palestinians in Gaza  Israel s eyes are never very far away  Surveillance drones buzz constantly from the skies  The highly secured border is awash with security cameras and soldiers on guard  Intelligence agencies work sources and cyber capabilities to draw out a bevy of information But Israel s eyes appeared to have been closed in the lead up to an unprecedented onslaught by the militant Hamas group  which broke down Israeli border barriers and sent hundreds of militants into Israel to carry out a brazen attack that has killed hundreds and pushed the region toward conflict Israel s intelligence agencies have gained an aura of invincibility over the decades because of a string of achievements  Israel has foiled plots seeded in the West Bank  allegedly hunted down Hamas operatives in Dubai and has been accused of killing Iranian nuclear scientists in the heart of Iran  Even when their efforts have stumbled  agencies like the Mossad  Shin Bet and military intelligence have maintained their mystique But the weekend s assault  which caught Israel off guard on a major Jewish holiday  plunges that reputation into doubt and raises questions about the country s readiness in the face of a weaker but determined foe  Over 24 hours later  Hamas militants continued to battle Israeli forces inside Israeli territory  and dozens of Israelis were in Hamas captivity in Gaza “This is a major failure ” said Yaakov Amidror  a former national security adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  “This operation actually proves that the  intelligence  abilities in Gaza were no good ”Amidror declined to offer an explanation for the failure  saying lessons must be learned when the dust settles Rear Adm  Daniel Hagari  the chief military spokesman  acknowledged the army owes the public an explanation  But he said now is not the time  “First  we fight  then we investigate ” he said Some say it is too early to pin the blame solely on an intelligence fault  They point to a wave of low level violence in the West Bank that shifted some military resources there and the political chaos roiling Israel over steps by Netanyahu s far right government to overhaul the judiciary  The controversial plan has threatened the cohesion of the country s powerful military But the apparent lack of prior knowledge of Hamas  plot will likely be seen as a prime culprit in the chain of events that led to the deadliest attack against Israelis in decades Israel withdrew troops and settlers from the Gaza Strip in 2005  stripping it of a close handle on the happenings in the territory  But even after Hamas overran Gaza in 2007  Israel appeared to maintain its edge  using technological and human intelligence It claimed to know the precise locations of Hamas leadership and appeared to prove it through the assassinations of militant leaders in surgical strikes  sometimes while they slept in their bedrooms  Israel has known where to strike underground tunnels used by Hamas to ferry around fighters and arms  destroying miles  kilometers  of the concealed passageways Despite those abilities  Hamas was able to keep its plan under wraps  The ferocious attack  which likely took months of planning and meticulous training and involved coordination among multiple militant groups  appeared to have gone under Israel s intelligence radar Amir Avivi  a retired Israeli general  said that without a foothold inside Gaza  Israel s security services have come to rely increasingly on technological means to gain intelligence  He said militants in Gaza have found ways to evade that technological intelligence gathering  giving Israel an incomplete picture of their intentions “The other side learned to deal with our technological dominance and they stopped using technology that could expose it ” said Avivi  who served as a conduit for intelligence materials under a former military chief of staff  Avivi is president and founder of Israel Defense and Security Forum  a hawkish group of former military commanders “They ve gone back to the Stone Age ” he said  explaining that militants weren t using phones or computers and were conducting their sensitive business in rooms specially guarded from technological espionage or going underground But Avivi said the failure extends beyond just intelligence gathering and Israel s security services failed to put together an accurate picture from the intelligence they were receiving  based on what he said was a misconception surrounding Hamas  intentions Israel s security establishment has in recent years increasingly seen Hamas as an actor interested in governing  seeking to develop Gaza s economy and improving the standard of living of Gaza s 2 3 million people  Avivi and others say the truth is that Hamas  which calls for Israel s destruction  still sees that aim as its priority Israel in recent years has allowed up to 18 000 Palestinian laborers from Gaza to work in Israel  where they can earn a salary about 10 times higher than in the impoverished coastal enclave  The security establishment saw that carrot as a way to maintain relative calm “In practice  hundreds if not thousands of Hamas men were preparing for a surprise attack for months  without that having leaked ” wrote Amos Harel  a defense commentator  in the daily Haaretz  “The results are catastrophic ”Allies who share intelligence with Israel said security agencies were misreading reality An Egyptian intelligence official said Egypt  which often serves as a mediator between Israel and Hamas  had spoken repeatedly with the Israelis about “something big ” without elaborating He said Israeli officials were focused on the West Bank and played down the threat from Gaza  Netanyahu s government is made up of supporters of Jewish West Bank settlers who have demanded a security crackdown in the face of a rising tide of violence there over the last 18 months “We have warned them an explosion of the situation is coming  and very soon  and it would be big  But they underestimated such warnings ” said the official  who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn t authorized to discuss the content of sensitive intelligence discussions with the media Israel has also been preoccupied and torn apart by Netanyahu s judicial overhaul plan  Netanyahu had received repeated warnings by his defense chiefs  as well as several former leaders of the country s intelligence agencies  that the divisive plan was chipping away at the cohesion of the country s security services Martin Indyk  who served as a special envoy for Israeli Palestinian negotiations during the Obama administration  said internal divisions over the legal changes was an aggravating factor that contributed to the Israelis being caught off guard  That roiled the IDF in a way that was  I think  we discovered was a huge distraction ” he said        Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s office says his Security Cabinet has declared the country at war following a deadly Hamas assault in southern Israel The decision  announced on Sunday  formally authorises “the taking of significant military steps ” it said it a statement “The war that was forced on the State of Israel in a murderous terrorist assault from the Gaza Strip began at 06 00 yesterday ” it said It gave no further details  But Netanyahu had previous declared the country at war  and the military has promised a harsh response in Gaza Israeli media say at least 600 people have been killed in the surprise cross border incursion by Hamas militants from the Gaza Strip        A US analysis indicates that Israel was not responsible for the deadly blast at a Gaza hospital that killed hundreds of civilians on Tuesday  the White House has said  basing its assessment on intelligence overhead imagery  intercepts and open source information The assessment by the US came on Wednesday the same day when President Joe Biden made a show of solidarity with Israel during his visit there The massive explosion at the Al Ahli Baptist Hospital late on Tuesday night killed 471 people and injured 314 others  the Palestinian Health Ministry has said  “The US government assesses that Israel was not responsible for an explosion that killed hundreds of civilians yesterday at the Al Ahli Hospital in the Gaza Strip ” White House National Security Council Spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a statement        President Joe Biden has visited Israel on an urgent mission to keep the Israel Hamas war from spiraling into a broader regional conflict  The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday that limited humanitarian aid would be allowed into Gaza from Egypt following a request from Biden The president s visit came after hundreds of people were reported killed in an explosion at a Gaza Strip hospital  There were conflicting claims of who was responsible for the hospital blast  Officials in Gaza quickly blamed an Israeli airstrike  Israel denied it was involved and released a flurry of video  audio and other information that it said showed the blast was due to a missile misfire by Islamic Jihad  another militant group operating in Gaza  The Islamic Jihad dismissed that claim The Associated Press has not independently verified any of the claims or evidence released by the parties The war that began Oct  7 has become the deadliest of five Gaza wars for both sides  The Hamas run Gaza Health Ministry said Wednesday that 3 478 Palestinians have been killed and more than 12 000 injured in the past 11 days More than 1 400 people in Israel have been killed  and at least 199 others  including children  were captured by Hamas and taken into Gaza

AFTER CLASSIFIED BRIEFING THAT ISRAEL NOT BEHIND HOSPITAL BLASTWASHINGTON   Senators who attended a classified briefing with top defense  intelligence and other administration officials said they were briefed that Israel was not responsible for the hospital blast “The intelligence community assesses that Israel is not to blame for the explosion of the hospital in Gaza ” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer  D N Y   said as he left  “They believe it was an errant rocket from terrorists in Gaza ”Democratic Sen  Chris Murphy of Connecticut said the intelligence is “definitive” that it was not an Israeli operation In a joint statement earlier  Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner  D Va   and Florida Sen  Marco Rubio  the top Republican on the panel  said they reviewed intelligence and “feel confident that the explosion was the result of a failed rocket launch by militant terrorists and not the result of an Israeli airstrike ”UN OFFICIALS WARN OVER GAZA HEALTH SYSTEM  RISK OF CONFLICT EXPANDINGUNITED NATIONS – U N  Humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths told an emergency meeting of the U N  Security Council that the deadly destruction of a hospital has heaped further pressure on Gaza s crumbling health system  depriving the territory of a facility that cared for 45 000 patients every year Speaking in a video briefing from Qatar  Griffiths also said the Al Ahli hospital was previously struck on Oct  14 He also said the death toll in the 11 days since Hamas  surprise attack inside Israel has already exceeded what was seen during seven weeks of Israeli Hamas hostilities in 2014 Meanwhile the U N  Mideast envoy warned that the risk of the conflict expanding is “very real and extremely dangerous ”Tor Wennesland told the council that recent events “have served to reignite grievances and re animate alliances across the region ”Earlier in the day at the U N   the United States vetoed a resolution that would have condemned violence against civilians in the Israel Hamas war and pushed for humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza U S  Ambassador Linda Thomas Greenfield said President Joe Biden was in the region engaging in diplomacy and

of serious and continuing concern  Those involved should be held responsible ” the Prime Minister said   Incidentally  he was one of the first world leaders to call out the October 7 assault by Hamas on Israel as a terror attack Hostilities between Israel and Hamas began after armed Hamas militants based in the Gaza Strip launched an unprecedented attack on Israel by land  air  and sea on October 7  Since the start of hostilities  as many as 2 778 Palestinians have been killed Media reports have cited official Israeli sources as saying that at least 1 400 Israelis and foreign nationals have been killed in Israel In a post soon after Hamas launched 5 000 rockets at Israel in 20 minutes and began a multi pronged attack by land  air and sea on October 7  Prime Minister Modi had said he was “deeply shocked by the news of terrorist attacks in Israel” and expressed India’s solidarity with the country in the difficult hour Modi reiterated his support for Israel on October 10  when he had posted that Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had called him and given him an update on the deadly conflict “I thank Prime Minister @netanyahu for his phone call and providing an update on the ongoing situation  People of India stand firmly with Israel in this difficult hour  India strongly and unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations ” Modi posted on X Speaking

peace and brotherhood Calling for the world to move forward with a human centric approach  he also said conflicts and confrontations in any part of the world impact everyone and do not benefit anyone        Describing Hamas as a barbaric terrorist organisation  an Indian American Congressman has said there is a need to eliminate the terror outfit The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a barrage of rocket attacks in Southern Israel on October 7  The unprecedented assault triggered retaliatory strikes from the Israel Defense Forces “Hamas is not a militant organisation  Hamas is not a resistance movement  They are just barbaric terrorists  There s no other way to describe it ” Shri Thanedar told a group of eminent Indian Americans at the US Capitol Hill on Monday “This is a time where we just can t just push them  Because they will regroup and come back and do these atrocities once again  That s what they will do  So  we need at this stage to eliminate them  eliminate them from the face of this earth ” he said at an event organised by HinduACTion here in support of Israel “We need to dismantle their military operations  We need to free the Palestinian people  the two million Palestinian people who live in Gaza  They need to be freed from these terrorist control of Gaza ” he said In a joint declaration  members of various faiths who attended the event urged the US Congress to develop comprehensive policies to enhance and guarantee the safety and security of Hindus  Sikhs  Jews  Hazara and Yezidi communities on college campuses The declaration urged the US Congress to strengthen laws to protect Jewish staff and students against rising anti Semitism on American campuses  It also appealed to the Congress to recognise Hinduphobia  formulate laws to counter growing anti Hindu bigotry and targeted Hinduphobia Thanedar  who recently formed the Congressional Caucus for Hindus  Sikhs  Buddhists and Jains  said that there are increasing instances of Hinduphobia in the country        An FIR has been registered against Kannada actor Darshan Thoogudeepa after his pet dogs allegedly attacked and bit a 48 year old woman who had parked her car near his house here  police said on Wednesday The incident took place on October 28 when the woman had gone to RR Nagar to attend a programme after parking her car at a vacant space near the actor s house in in RR Nagar  they said In her complaint  she alleged that when she returned after attending the programme  she saw a person with three dogs standing near her vehicle  When she requested him to take the dogs away so that she could get into her car  he allegedly refused and picked up a fight with her over parking the vehicle there  This led to a heated argument between the woman and the dogs  caretaker during which the dogs allegedly attacked her The dogs belonged to actor Darshan  They allegedly bit her and tore her clothes  according to police  Based on the woman s complaint  both the actor and the dogs  caretaker have been booked under Section 289  Negligent conduct with respect to animal  of the Indian Penal Code   a senior police officer said        Palestinians scrambled to flee northern Gaza after Israel s military urged about 1 million people to leave for the territory s south ahead of an expected ground invasion following the surprise attack a week ago by the ruling Hamas militant group   despite warnings from the U N  That evacuating nearly half of Gaza s population would be calamitous Families in cars  trucks and donkey carts packed with their possessions crowded a main road southward from Gaza City as Israeli airstrikes hammered the territory Friday  Hamas  media office said warplanes struck cars fleeing south  killing more than 70 people The Israeli military said its troops conducted temporary raids into Gaza to battle militants and hunted for traces of some 150 people abducted in Hamas s assault on Israel nearly a week ago In urging the evacuation  Israel s military said it planned to target underground Hamas hideouts around Gaza City  But Palestinians and some Egyptian officials fear that Israel ultimately hopes to push Gaza s people out through the southern border with Egypt The U N  Called on Israel to reverse the unprecedented directive  But Israel s military said it planned to target underground Hamas hideouts around Gaza City Hamas told people to ignore the evacuation order  Families in Gaza faced what they saw as a no win decision to leave or stay  with no safe ground anywhere  Israeli strikes have levelled large swaths of neighbourhoods  and Gaza has been sealed off from food  water and medical supplies   all under a virtual total power blackout “Forget about food  forget about electricity  forget about fuel  The only concern now is just if you ll make it  if you re going to live ” said Nebal Farsakh  a spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent in Gaza City  as she broke into heaving sobs In the week old war  the Gaza Health Ministry said Friday that roughly 1 900 people have been killed in the territory  The Hamas assault last Saturday killed more than 1 300 Israelis  most of whom were civilians  and roughly 1 500 Hamas militants were killed during the fighting  the Israeli government said ISRAELI TROOPS MAKE FORAY INTO GAZAIsrael s raid Friday was the first word of troops entering Gaza since Israel s round the clock bombardment in retaliation for Hamas  massacre of hundreds of civilians in southern Israel A military spokesman said Israeli ground troops left after conducting the raids  The troop movements did not appear to be the beginning of an expected ground invasion The evacuation order was taken as a further signal of an expected Israeli ground offensive  although no such decision has been announced Israel has been massing troops along the Gaza border  although no decision on a ground offensive has been announced An assault into densely populated and impoverished Gaza would likely bring even higher casualties on both sides in brutal house to house fighting “We will destroy Hamas ” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Friday night in a speech Hamas said Israel s airstrikes killed 13 hostages  It said the dead included foreigners but did not give their nationalities  Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm  Daniel Hagari denied the claim In Israel  the public is overwhelmingly in favour of a military offensive  and Israeli TV stations have set up special broadcasts with slogans like “together we will win” and “strong together ” Their reports focus heavily on the aftermath of the Hamas attack and stories of heroism and national unity  and they make scant mention of the unfolding crisis in Gaza In the occupied West Bank  the Palestinian Health Ministry reported 16 Palestinians were killed Friday  bringing the total of Palestinians killed there to 51  The U N  Says attacks by Israeli settlers have surged there since the Hamas assault ISRAEL URGES MASS EVACUATION OF GAZA CIVILIANSThe U N  Said the Israeli military s call for civilians to move south affects 1 1 million people  If carried out  that would mean the territory s entire population would have to cram into the southern half of the 40 kilometer strip An Israeli spokesperson  Jonathan Conricus  said the military would take “extensive efforts to avoid harming civilians” and that residents would be allowed to return when the war is over Israel has long accused Hamas of using Palestinians as human shields  Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Israel wanted to separate Hamas militants from the civilian population “So those who want to save their life  please go south ” he said at a news conference with U S  Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin U N  Spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said it would be impossible to stage such an evacuation without “devastating humanitarian consequences ”PALESTINIANS IN GAZA GRAPPLE WITH WHERE TO GOHamas  media office said airstrikes hit cars in three locations as they headed south from Gaza City  killing 70 people  There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the strikes Two witnesses reported a strike on fleeing cars near the town of Deir el Balah  south of the evacuation zone and in the area Israel told people to flee to  Fayza Hamoudi said she and her family were driving from their home in the north when the strike hit some distance ahead on the road and two vehicles burst into flames  A witness from another car on the road gave a similar account “Why should we trust that they re trying to keep us safe ” Hamoudi said  her voice choking  “They are sick ”The Israeli military did not respond to a request for comment on the strike Many feared they would not be able to return or would be gradually displaced to Egypt s Sinai Peninsula More than half of the Palestinians in Gaza are descendants of refugees from the 1948 war surrounding Israel s creation  when hundreds of thousands fled or were expelled from what is now Israel  For many  the evacuation order dredged up fears of a second expulsion  Already  at least 4 23 000 people   nearly 1 in 5 Gazans   have been forced from their homes by Israeli airstrikes  the U N  Said Thursday “Where is the sense of security in Gaza  Is this what Hamas is offering us ” said one resident  Tarek Mraish  standing by an avenue as vehicles flowed by The U N  Estimated that tens of thousands had fled homes in the north by Friday night HOSPITALS STRUGGLE WITH PATIENTSGaza s Health Ministry said it was impossible to safely transport the many wounded from hospitals  which are already struggling with high numbers of dead and injured  “We cannot evacuate hospitals and leave the wounded and sick to die ” spokesperson Ashraf al Qidra said Farsakh  of the Palestinian Red Crescent  said some medics refused to abandon patients and instead called colleagues to say goodbye “We have wounded  we have elderly  we have children who are in hospitals ” she said Al Awda Hospital struggled to evacuate dozens of patients and staff after the military contacted it and told it to do so by Friday night  said the aid group Doctors Without Borders  which supports the facility  The military extended the deadline to Saturday morning  it said The U N  Agency for Palestinian refugees  known as UNRWA  said it would not evacuate its schools  where hundreds of thousands have taken shelter  But it relocated its headquarters to southern Gaza  according to spokesperson Juliette Touma “The scale and speed of the unfolding humanitarian crisis is bone chilling  Gaza is fast becoming a hellhole and is on the brink of collapse ” said Philippe Lazzarini  UNRWA s commissioner general        Aid deliveries have begun moving into the besieged Gaza Strip  two weeks after the militant group Hamas rampaged through southern Israel and Israel responded with airstrikes Israel says Hamas has freed two American hostages who had been held in Gaza since the war began Oct  7  Israeli airstrikes continued to hit southern Gaza  an area swollen by civilians who fled there from the north on Israeli instructions  Israel s military spokesman said the country is stepping up its attacks  coming amid growing expectations of a ground offensive The war  in its 16th day Sunday  is the deadliest of five Gaza wars for both sides  The Hamas run Gaza Health Ministry said Saturday that the death toll has reached 4 385  while 13 561 people have been wounded More than 1 400 people in Israel have been killed  mostly in the initial attack on Oct  7 when Hamas militants stormed into Israel  In addition  203 people were believed captured by Hamas during the incursion and taken into Gaza  the Israeli military has said Currently 1  The father of freed American

delivering a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense  or THAAD  battery along with additional Patriot missile defense system batteries “to locations throughout the region to increase force protection for U S  Troops ” Bases in Iraq and Syria have been repeatedly targeted by drones in the days since hundreds were killed in a hospital blast in Gaza  and the destroyer USS Carney intercepted land attack cruise missiles in the Red Sea shot from Yemen on Thursday Austin said he had also placed additional forces on prepare to deploy orders  “part of prudent contingency planning” as the U S  And others brace for the potential of a wider regional conflict and as Israel prepares to launch a ground assault into Gaza  He said he gave the orders after detailed discussions with President Joe Biden on the recent escalations by Iran and its proxy forces across the region ISRAEL STRIKES UNDERGROUND COMPOUND AT WEST BANK MOSQUE  MILITARY SAYSIsraeli Defense Forces said a military aircraft launched a strike early Sunday on the Al Ansar mosque at the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank The IDF said via X  the platform formerly known as Twitter  that Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants had been using an “underground terror route” beneath the mosque  One Palestinian was killed in the shelling  Palestinian Red Crescent said Tensions have risen in the West Bank  where dozens of Palestinians have been killed in clashes with Israeli troops  arrest raids and attacks by Jewish settlers ITALIAN PREMIER GOES TO ISRAELROME   Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni has made a trip to Israel to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  her office said The meeting Saturday came after Meloni participated in a summit in Cairo focused on ways to de escalate the raging Israel Hamas war Meloni s office said that in her meeting she reiterated “the right of Israel to defend itself under international law and to live in peace” while also underlining  the importance of guaranteeing humanitarian access to Gaza and a prospect of peace for the region  Her office said she brought “a message of solidary and Italy s closeness” following Hamas  unprecedented attack on Oct  7 PRESIDENT BIDEN SPEAKS WITH 2 FREED HOSTAGESWASHINGTON   President Joe Biden has spoken on the phone with two freed Americans who had been held hostage by Hamas in Gaza Judith Raanan and her 17 year old daughter  Natalie  were released Friday  It was the first such hostage release from among the roughly 200 people the militant group abducted from Israel during its Oct  7 rampage Video of Biden speaking with them by phone was posted Saturday on the X platform  formerly known as Twitter  He told the mother and daughter that he was glad they had been released “We re going to get them all out  God willing ” he said Natalie thanked Biden for his “services” to Israel  Judith said they are in good health Hamas said it released the mother and daughter for humanitarian reasons in an agreement with the Qatari government Family members have said Judith and Natalie had been on a trip from their home in the Chicago suburb of Evanston to Israel to celebrate Judith s mother s birthday and the Jewish holidays        The escalating conflict between Israel and Hamas has become a critical juncture in the West Asian region  Hamas’ audacious attack has exposed vulnerabilities in Israel’s security apparatus  triggering a humanitarian crisis  Controversial evacuation orders have rekindled memories of historic displacements  As tensions mount  there are growing concerns about the potential for a broader regional crisis Hamas has surprised the State of Israel by launching one of the deadliest terror attacks on it last week  since its foundation in 1948  This brazen assault by the terror group is viewed as a turning point in Israel Palestinian conflict  The multi pronged war is now seen as long planned and clearly failed the sophisticated Israeli security network  known for decades for its stealth work and extensive espionage activities against its enemies like Hamas and Hezbollah This crisis is crucial for the US  No US President can ignore a conflict in which Israel is at stake or directly involved in the war  Also  for President Joe Biden  who is fighting re election next year  the quagmire in West Asia is decisive  This crisis is virtually challenging the world order led by the US  since the end of the Second World War and the establishment of the UN Well  Hamas knows its limits  And Israel can easily assess how far it can push  With an annual military aid of about $3 billion to the country  the Israelis will be giving a tough fight to Hamas  Only time will tell how the current crisis unfolds and how bloodier and costlier it is going to be  But for sure  it will lead to one of the most serious humanitarian tragedies in recent days in West Asia Who is Hamas  Hamas is a Palestinian Sunni militant group that was founded on December 10  1987  after the first intifada  uprising   Its name is an acronym which comes from Harakat al Muqawama al Islamiya  Its English translation means Islamic Resistance Movement For Hamas  the main objectives since its inception have been the creation of an independent Palestine state and the destruction of the Israeli state  It will fight till the end  However  sustaining a prolonged conflict with an armed Israel would inevitably lead to further loss of lives  both in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank  in the days to come Is it possible for Israel to fortify the nation adequately  It is an extremely challenging task for any nation  including Israel  Israel has been under threat from all its neighbours since its inception  However  the country has built an excellent security system over the years to counter attacks from non state actors like Hamas and Hezbollah  This attack by Hamas indicates a near total security and intelligence failure on Israel’s part  as experts suggest Meanwhile  there has been a deluge of international reaction to the ongoing war between Hamas and Israel  The international victims of assault on Israel by Hamas come from the US  the UK  Ireland  France  Germany  Italy  Austria  Canada  Thailand  Nepal  the Philippines  Cambodia  China  Tanzania  Brazil  Paraguay  Mexico  etc It is certain that Gaza Strip will soon turn into a hotspot of humanitarian tragedy  Israel has asked more than one million Gazans to vacate the North Gaza in no time and to move towards the south  But the UN says the Israeli evacuation order is impossible without a major humanitarian catastrophe The UN also warns that Gaza is becoming a “hell hole on the brink of collapse” signalling that war clouds hovering over the Gaza Strip  the people might face all the hardships simply to survive  On the other hand  Hamas told Gazans not to leave their homes By now  the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is deepening  as Israel has already cut off food and electricity to the besieged territory  Most of the common people are at risk of starvation  According to the estimate from the Palestinian Ministry of Health  more than 1 800 people have died so far  The UN reports that over 4 23 000 people are internally displaced due to the massive air raids conducted by the Israeli Defence Forces  IDF  since October 7 US President Joe Biden strongly criticised Hamas for its military mission against Israel  In an official message delivered immediately after the offensive  he said  “We are with Israel  Let us make no mistake ” He further emphasised that Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people’s right to dignity and self determination  Its stated purpose is the annihilation of the State of Israel and the murder of Jewish people However  Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin has criticised Israel for employing “quite cruel methods” in its response to the Hamas attack  He said  “In my view  it is unacceptable  More than two million people live there  Not all of them support Hamas by the way  but all of them have to suffer  including women and children  Of course  it is difficult for anyone to agree with this ”This shows that Putin is fully aware of the chaos left behind by the relentless aerial bombing carried out by Israel over the Gaza Strip Previously  he also stated that an Israeli ground operation would be entirely unacceptable  as it would result in significant casualties  He advocates for the resolution of this crisis through negotiations  with Russia playing a role in the peace process due to its longstanding relations with both parties  These lofty words coming from a crude statesman who has been at war with his neighbour and creating another global crisis leading to thousands of deaths and displacement of lakhs in Ukraine  Before offering solutions to clash between Hamas and Israel  he must first deescalate the Ukraine crisis that he had started in February 2022 The US Secretary of State  Antony Blinken  visited Israel and reaffirmed his country’s unwavering support for the latter  However  he also acknowledged the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians that are not represented by Hamas militants  While meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  Blinken said  “You may be strong enough to defend yourself on your own  But as long as America exists  you will never ever have to  We will always be there by your side ” This shows how the US is directly providing aid to the Jewish state  while all other Western allies of Israel remain relatively quiet  Washington has taken one step further by sending its Defence Secretary Llyod Austin both to bolster support for Tel Aviv and assure all possible help to its ally By pledging full support to Israel  Austin said  “This is no time for neutrality  or for false equivalence or for excuses for the inexcusable ”When Blinken met the President of Palestinian Mahmoud Abbas in Jordan  the latter rejected the “forced displacement of the Gazans” from the northern Gaza He strongly opposed the idea of evacuation and to him such a move would lead to “Second Nakba”  Naqba  Palestinian Catastrophe  is an Arabic word that refers to the catastrophe brought by the creation of the Zionist State in 1948 and the displacement of nearly 7 50 000 Palestinians from their homes This all happened only after the end of the historic British Mandate and the establishment of Israel on May 14  1948  This finally resulted in the beginning of the first Arab Israeli War  Subsequently  the Zionist military forces captured 78 per cent of the historic lands of Palestine and today the remaining 22 per cent are left as the occupied West Bank and the besieged Gaza Strip So now  with the evacuation of the Northern Gaza as per the order of Israel for beginning its ground offensive to crush Hamas and to rescue the hostages taken might lead to another Naqba At the moment  the Israeli security forces are conducting local raids in Gaza to locate the hostages taken by Hamas  And as per some media reports  the IDF is able to free nearly 200 hostages from the hands of Hamas so far  The battle is on  and it is certainly going to be bloodier than ever before The road ahead is complicated and filled with dangerous twists and turns for both Israel and Hamas  There will be no solution until an independent state of Palestine is created  But this will not be feasible given the circumstances that have led to the current hostilities between Israel and Hamas  Furthermore  a counteroffensive by Hezbollah and involvement of nearby Arab nations against Israel might further complicate the situation  However  while dealing with Hamas  the IDF and the Israeli State is careful to minimise civilian casualties  Otherwise  the Israel Hamas conflict may escalate into a larger regional quagmire  The writer is currently president of the Global Research Foundation        A case has been registered against Union Minister of State Rajeev Chandrasekhar for allegedly making statements that promote enmity between different groups  a move which was slammed by the BJP on Tuesday BJP Kerala chief K Surendran alleged that this action by the Pinarayi Vijayan government was aimed at  helping  and  encouraging  divisive forces and those with extremist views   It indicates the double standards of the Pinarayi Vijayan government   he said while speaking to reporters in Thiruvananthapuram The party said it would face the case against the central minister both politically and legally  The Kerala police registered the FIR on its own in connection with the minister s recent statements on social media regarding the Kochi blasts and a Hamas leader s virtual address at an event organised by an Islamist group in Malappuram district of the state recently A senior officer of Kochi city police said an FIR under sections 153A  promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion  race  place of birth  residence  of the IPC and section 120  o   causing nuisance and violation of public order  of the Kerala Police Act has been registered against the minister  Surendran also slammed the Left government and the police for not registering a case against CPI M  state secretary M V Govindan for terming the Kochi bomb blasts as a  terrorist act  He also pointed out that no case was registered against IUML MLA M K Muneer and CPI M  leader M Swaraj for hailing the recent Hamas attack on Israel  The BJP leader further alleged that the government was not ready to register a case against the Islamist group that organised an event in Malappuram district of the state recently where a Hamas leader virtually addressed the gathering   But they are registering a case against a central minister who spoke out against the same This  FIR  is a heinous decision based on vote bank politics  It is aimed at making political gains during the upcoming Lok Sabha elections   he alleged  The BJP leader also claimed that the case against the central minister was registered to appease those who are against the country and not those who love the nation  After reports of the bomb blasts at a religious gathering of Jehovah s Witnesses in Kalamassery near here came out on Sunday  Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology Chandrasekhar put up posts on social media platform X criticising Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan

Terrorist Hamas for Jihad is causing attacks and bomb blasts on innocent Christians   he had said  Following this  a verbal duel took place on Monday between the CM and Chandrasekhar with the BJP leader calling Vijayan a  liar  and he in turn lashing out and terming the MoS  extremely venomous  The CM also said that if anyone makes statements which are in violation of the law  irrespective of whether they are central or state ministers  cases would be registered against them  Meanwhile  the Congress has lodged a complaint with the State Police Chief against Chandrasekhar  BJP National

but to hit back hard but a more serious introspection and recalibration of governance is overdueThe recent Hamas attack on Israel has been a huge blot on Israeli perceptions  not because Hamas will come remotely close to holding onto anything tangible  but due to the abject Israeli failure to pre empt a strike of such magnitude and intensity  Has too much been romanticised about the Israeli intelligence agencies  Mossad  Aman  Shin Bet etc   their preparedness  or even of its fabled security apparatus that could supposedly deter any attackers How did Israel not pick the unavoidable assemblage and telltale signs of fighters  weaponry and planning that goes into the execution of such a gargantuan operation  Hamas claims to have fired 5 000 rockets  though Israel suggests half  and breached supposedly well guarded borders with technologically advanced barriers  replete with concrete  sensors  and cameras etc   Further  these borders were also supposedly always manned by trained and armed patrols  What happened to the apparently impregnable and highly advanced Iron Dome missile system – did it get overwhelmed by the simultaneous barrage of rockets  There were even six to seven paraglider borne Hamas elements seen flying over Israeli barriers  just as Hamas attempted to cross into Israeli land by sea  with landing vessels  Civilian bulldozers were put into action to demolish the protective electric wire fencing on the border  The meticulously choreographed Hamas sweep was virtually from all directions with pick up trucks facilitating their racy entry through border breeches Even politically  it wasn’t as if a pacifist politician e g   Shimon Peres  or one from a non military background e g   Ehud Olmert  Golda Meir or Menachem Begin  was leading the current Israeli dispensation – it is led by the ultra hawkish Benjamin ‘Bibi’ Netanyahu  who served in the Israel Defence Forces and whose brother is the legendary ‘Yoni’ Netanyahu  who commanded Sayeret Matkal  Special Operation Team  during the daring Entebbe raid  and was the only Israeli fatality in that operation  How did a political leader with such ‘muscular’ politics  positions and commitments lower his guard to such an extent  that it was caught completely by surprise  Has Israel’s historical brazenness in sovereign conduct and defending itself been grossly mistaken for efficacy in action  especially in containing militancy  Indeed  Israel’s history and geography have bestowed it with extraordinary challenges that warrant its popular belligerence  but that notwithstanding  this is not the first time that it has been caught off guard  so completely  Exactly fifty years to the day  the Arab coalition of Egypt  Syria  Jordan  Iraq etc   launched a sudden  coordinated  and swift attack  Yom Kippur War  across the ceasefire line and entered the Israeli held Sinai Peninsula and Golan Heights  That the Israeli forces counterattacked and inflicted a terrible price on joint Arab ambitions  pride  and consciousness is another matter – what was similar then  as is now  the Israelis with all their fabled intelligence depth and instinct  had failed to pick the attack miserably  as it failed now While the familiar term that followed the ‘9 11’ fiasco  as far as the US intelligence services were concerned  had seen some ‘red flags’ but failed to ‘connect the dots’ will surely emerge in the postmortem of the Hamas attack  What is glaring is that the sheer quantum of human  material and multiple front attacks that entailed this Hamas attack  which Israel declares their own ‘9 11’  is far more difficult to hide than the original ‘9 11’ operations  As the second biggest intelligence agency in the world with an impressive annual budget of $3 billion and with almost negligible threat perceptions from the Arab States anymore  given their constraints and evolved narrative – the Mossad ought to have had Hamas  Lebanese Hezbollah’s sabre rattling notwithstanding  as the only realistic threat  and yet it slipped through  The consequences of the fractured and deeply polarised Israeli society in recent times  especially on the relatively moderate security agencies cannot be discounted  Many in the intelligentsia and elites of Israeli society  including senior leadership in IDF  were bitterly opposed to Netanyahu’s toying with the constitution  and with the Supreme Court  and pandering to the religious hardliners who have no understanding or background of security imperatives  A disengaged and dejected security environment couldn’t have helped matters  as Netanyahu was speeding ahead with changing the status quo of the Israeli state and sensibilities  recklessly  A couple of years back  six former security chiefs had warned against Netanyahu’s politicisation of the security apparatus to buttress his political appeal  whilst compromising on its traditional restraint and apolitical bearings Beyond Netanyahu’s misadventures  a certain hubris and overconfidence by Israel’s intelligence agencies is obvious  perhaps a collateral damage of ‘Hollywoodising’ their image to mythic proportions  The Israeli reality is never as James Bondish as it is made out to be  as its undeniable counterattack ritual and lack of ‘political correctness’ in the face of repeated UN sanctions  does give it a larger than life aura  but not invincibility  History validates many spectacular failures like the 1973 Yom Kippur War  or now with the latest Hamas attack Another lesson for other countries is the overplaying of a ‘muscular’ hand in insurgencies without an element of accompanying and necessary political societal inputs  Israel was safer in the 90’s when the Oslo Accord was signed by the likes of Shimon Peres  but decidedly more violent when hardliners like Netanyahu or Sharon ruled  For now  Israel has no choice but to hit back hard but a more serious introspection and recalibration of governance is overdue   The writer  a military veteran  is a former Lt Governor of Andaman   Nicobar Islands and Puducherry  The views expressed are personal        With India abstaining from voting on a United Nations resolution on the Israel Hamas conflict as the resolution did not condemn Hamas’ terror acts  Opposition parties in India on Saturday asserted that the move goes against everything the country has stood for  even as the BJP stressed that India will never be on the side of terrorism India voted in favour of an amendment proposed by Canada that asked for inserting a paragraph in the resolution that would state that the General Assembly “unequivocally rejects and condemns the terrorist attacks by Hamas that took place in Israel starting on October 7  2023  and the taking of hostages  demands the safety  well being and humane treatment of the hostages in compliance with international law  and calls for their immediate and unconditional release”  As the draft amendment could not be adopted  India abstained However  India also raised concerns on the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza Leaders of parties like the Congress  the CPI  the CPI M   the BSP and the AIMIM said they were “shocked” and “ashamed” over India’s stand on the Jordan drafted resolution that called for an immediate humanitarian truce in the Israel Hamas conflict and unhindered humanitarian access in the Gaza Strip Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar claimed there was “total confusion” in the approach of the Narendra Modi Government to the Palestine issue However  explaining New Delhi’s decision  sources said India is concerned over the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza but at the same time strongly considers that there can be no equivocation on terror  noting the resolution did not include any explicit condemnation of the October 7 terrorist attacks by Hamas Sources said in the absence of all elements of India’s approach not being covered in the final text of the UN Resolution  Delhi abstained in the vote on its adoption  The sources said India’s vote on the Resolution was guided by its steadfast and consistent position on the issue and India s Explanation of Vote reiterated this comprehensively and holistically  India’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Yojna Patel  in the Explanation of Vote  EOV   said  “Terrorism is a malignancy and knows no borders  nationality or race  The world should not buy into any justification of terror acts  Let us keep aside differences  unite and adopt a zero tolerance approach to terrorism ”The EOV also strongly conveyed India’s concerns on the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza  saying  “Casualties in the ongoing conflict in Gaza are a telling  serious and continuing concern  Civilians  especially women and children are paying with their lives  This humanitarian crisis needs to be addressed  We welcome the international community s de escalation efforts and delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza  India too has contributed to this effort ”Sources noted that India s EOV also stressed its consistent stand on Palestine In a post on X  the Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra quoted Mahatma Gandhi’s “an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind” to criticise the Government’s stand “I am shocked and ashamed that our country has abstained from voting for a ceasefire in Gaza ” she said “Our country was founded on the principles of non violence and truth  principles for which our freedom fighters laid down their lives  these principles form the basis of the constitution that defines our nationhood ” she said They represent the moral courage of India that guided its actions as a member of the international community  she added Reacting to Priyanka’s remarks  senior BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said those who are ashamed and shocked must realise that India will never be on the side of terrorism  “India’s Explanation of Vote spelt this out categorically  Our position on the Israel  Palestine issue is steadfast and consistent  Those who choose to side with terror do so at their own peril    ” the former Union Minority Affairs Minister said on X “On a lighter note  Priyanka Ji  you should first educate yourself on things that are put out from your X account  Looks like people  who have no idea of Congress’ past positions on the situation  are advising you ” he said “What is worse is that in an attempt to make you look ‘better’ than Rahul  they are making you look silly ” Naqvi added BSP MP Danish Ali said he had never imagined that India would leave the oppressed to their fate “I urge Prime Minister Narendra Modi to protect our special identity in the world by living up to the basic principles of humanity and play a role in saving the suffering children and drowning humanity in Gaza ” he said in a post in Hindi on X In a post on Facebook  he alleged that the Israeli army is killing Palestinians and the world is watching it like it is an action movie “And many stone hearted people are rejoicing over the killing of innocent children or counting the dead bodies ” he said “India was founded on the principles of truth and non violence  the core principles for which our freedom fighters sacrificed their lives  these principles are the basis of the Indian Constitution that defines our nationhood and unique identity in the world “They represent India’s moral courage that has guided its actions as a member of the international community ” he said The CPI M  and the CPI said that India abstaining from voting on the United Nations resolution is “shocking” and shows that Indian foreign policy is now shaped by “being a subordinate ally of US imperialism” Communist Party of India  Marxist  General Secretary Sitaram Yechury and CPI General Secretary D Raja said in a joint statement titled ‘Stop this Genocidal Aggression in Gaza’ that India’s move negates its long standing support to the Palestinian cause “It is shocking that India abstained on a Resolution overwhelmingly adopted by the UN General Assembly calling for a humanitarian truce titled ‘Protection of civilians and upholding legal and humanitarian obligations’ in the ongoing Israeli offensive in Gaza ” they said India has said terrorism is a “malignancy” and knows no borders  nationality or race and the world should not buy into any justification of terror acts  as it abstained on a resolution on the Israel Hamas conflict Replying to a question at a press conference  NCP leader Sharad Pawar said India never supported the way Gaza is being attacked “Today  there is total confusion in the Indian Government’s policy  I have never seen such confusion from the Indian Government over the Palestine and Gaza issue  The first statement of the PM totally supported Israel  When there was a reaction from the outside world and India  the foreign ministry took a different line and spoke in favour of Palestine ” Pawar  a former defence minister  claimed AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi said it is “shocking” that India abstained from voting for the UN General Assembly resolution The resolution  which garnered 121 votes in favour  44 abstentions and 14 member states voting against it  also demanded the immediate  continuous  sufficient and unhindered provision of essential goods and services to civilians throughout the Gaza Strip  Over 1 400 people were killed in the unprecedented attacks on Israel by Hamas on October 7  Hamas also took more than 220 people hostage  Israel then launched retaliatory strikes  The Health Ministry inHamas ruled Gaza said on Saturday that over 7 700 Palestinians have died since October 7        The United Nations  its top leaders and agencies have expressed horror and strong condemnation over the killing of hundreds of civilians in a strike on a hospital in Gaza  underscoring that attack on hospitals or civilian infrastructure is against international humanitarian law and called for holding those responsible to account The airstrike on Al Ahili hospital on Tuesday killed at least 500 people  Gaza s Hamas run Health Ministry said  blaming Israel for the attack Israeli authorities have  however  denied involvement with the Israeli Defence Forces saying rockets misfired by Islamic Jihad militants towards Israel failed after launch and hit the hospital “I am horrified by the killing of hundreds of Palestinian civilians in a strike on a hospital in Gaza today  which I strongly condemn  My heart is with the families of the victims  Hospitals and medical personnel are protected under international humanitarian law ” UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said on X In another post on X  Guterres said too many lives and the fate of the entire region hang in the balance as he called for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire” in the Middle East to ease epic human suffering A statement issued by his spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said Guterres condemned the “strike this evening on Al Ahli Anglican Episcopal Hospital in Gaza  with preliminary reports of hundreds killed and many others wounded  including women and children” He emphasised that hospitals  clinics  medical personnel  and UN premises are explicitly protected under international law  the statement said The Secretary General also condemned the attack on a UNRWA school on Tuesday in Al Maghazi refugee camp in Gaza which killed at least six people  the statement said The Secretary General extended his sincere condolences to the families of the victims and wished a swift recovery to those injured President of the 78th session of the United Nations General Assembly Dennis Francis said he is “shocked and horrified” by the attack on Al Ahli Hospital in Gaza “Any attack on hospitals  schools or civilian infrastructure  targeting civilians and taking them hostage  is against international humanitarian law and goes against our common humanity ” Francis said “Collective efforts to de escalate and to facilitate humanitarian access are urgently needed to avoid more bloodshed and civilian casualties ”UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said in a statement that hospitals are sacrosanct and must be protected at all costs “Words fail me  Tonight  hundreds of people were killed – horrifically – in a massive strike at Al Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City  including patients  healthcare workers and families that had been seeking refuge in and around the hospital  Once again the most vulnerable  This is totally unacceptable ” he said The top UN Human rights official said that while the full scale of the carnage is yet not known  “what is clear is that the violence and killings must stop at once  “All states with influence must do everything in their power to bring an end to this horrendous situation  Civilians must be protected  and humanitarian aid must be allowed to reach those in need as a matter of urgency  Those found responsible must be held to account ” Turk said The World Health Organisation  WHO  also strongly condemned the attack on the hospital  which was operational with patients  health and caregivers  and internally displaced people sheltering there The WHO said the hospital was one of 20 in the north of the Gaza Strip facing evacuation orders from the Israeli military “The order for evacuation has been impossible to carry out given the current insecurity  critical condition of many patients  and lack of ambulances  staff  health system bed capacity  and alternative shelter for those displaced ” the global health agency said The WHO called for the immediate active protection of civilians and health care  “Evacuation orders must be reversed  International humanitarian law must be abided by  which means health care must be actively protected and never targeted ” it said The UN Population Fund  UNFPA  also strongly condemned the strike on the Al Ahli hospital  saying attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure must cease and healthcare facilities must never be a target In the wake of the attack  the United Arab Emirates and Russia called for an emergency UN Security Council meeting on Palestine  including the strike on the hospital Gaza has a population of more than two million and since October 7  when the current conflict began after Hamas launched an audacious terror attack on Israel and the Jewish state declared war on the militant group  about one million Palestinians have been displaced and nearly half of them are sheltering in UNRWA schools in the Gaza Strip Dr  Richard Peeperkorn  WHO Representative in the Occupied Palestinian Territory  said people seeking refuge from the conflict  go to these hospitals because they expect they are safe places  Now  even a hospital is not a safe place anymore  what is ”Before the Al Alhi Hospital deaths  Israeli strikes on Gaza killed at least 2 778 people and wounded 9 700  according to the Gaza Health Ministry Nearly two thirds of those killed were children  a ministry official said Another 1 200 people across Gaza are believed to be buried under the rubble  alive or dead  health authorities said Hamas  October 7  attack in southern Israel killed more than 1 400 people  mostly civilians  and resulted in some 200 being taken captive into Gaza  Hamas militants in Gaza have launched rockets every day since  aiming at cities across Israel        A massive blast rocked a Gaza City hospital packed with wounded and other Palestinians seeking shelter Tuesday  killing hundreds of people  the Hamas run Health Ministry said  Hamas blamed an Israeli airstrike  while the Israeli military blamed a rocket misfired by other Palestinian militants At least 500 people were killed  the ministry said As rage spread through the region because of the hospital carnage  and with US President Joe Biden heading to the Mideast in hopes of stopping the war from spreading  Jordan s foreign minister said his country canceled a regional summit scheduled for Wednesday in Amman  where Biden was to meet with Jordan s King Abdullah II  Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el Sissi The war between Israel and Hamas was “pushing the region to the brink ” Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi told state run television  He said Jordan would host the summit only when everyone had agreed its purpose would be to “stop the war  respect the humanity of the Palestinians and deliver the aid they deserve ”Biden will now visit only Israel  a White House official said The explosion at the al Ahli Hospital left gruesome scenes  Video that The Associated Press confirmed was from the hospital showed fire engulfing the building and the hospital grounds strewn with torn bodies  many of them young children  The grass around them was strewn with blankets  school backpacks and other belongings The bloodshed unfolded as the US tried to convince Israel to allow the delivery of supplies to desperate civilians  aid groups and hospitals in the tiny Gaza Strip  which has been under a complete siege since Hamas  deadly rampage in southern Israel last week  Hundreds of thousands of increasingly desperate people were searching for bread and water Hamas called Tuesday s hospital blast “a horrific massacre ” saying it was caused by an Israeli strike The Israeli military blamed Islamic Jihad  a smaller  more radical Palestinian militant group that often works with Hamas  The military said Islamic Jihad militants had fired a barrage of rockets near the hospital and that “intelligence from multiple sources  indicated the group was responsible In a briefing with reporters  the chief army spokesman  Rear Adm  Daniel Hagari  said the army determined there were no air force  ground or naval attacks in the area at the time of the blast  He said radar detected outgoing rocket fire at the same moment  and intercepted communications between militant groups indicated that Islamic Jihad fired the rockets Hagari also shared aerial footage collected by a military drone that showed a blast that he said was inconsistent with Israeli weaponry  He said the explosion occurred in the building s parking lot Since the war began  the military said in a statement that roughly 450 rockets fired at Israel by militant groups had landed in Gaza  “endangering and harming the lives of Gazan residents ”Islamic Jihad dismissed those claims  accusing Israel of “trying hard to evade responsibility for the brutal massacre it committed ”The group pointed to Israel s order that Al Ahli be evacuated and its previous bombing of the hospital complex as proof that the hospital was an Israeli target  It also said the scale of the explosion  the angle of the bomb s fall and the extent of the destruction all pointed to Israel Hundreds of Palestinians had taken refuge in Al Ahli and other hospitals in Gaza City in past days  hoping they would be spared bombardment after Israel ordered all residents of the city and surrounding areas to evacuate to the southern Gaza Strip Ambulances and private cars rushed some 350 casualties from the al Ahli blast to Gaza City s main hospital  al Shifa  which was already overwhelmed with wounded from other strikes  said its director  Mohammed Abu Selmia  The wounded were laid onto bloody floors  screaming in pain “We need equipment  we need medicine  we need beds  we need anesthesia  we need everything ” Abu Selmia said  He warned that fuel for the hospital s generators would run out within hours Before the Al Alhi Hospital deaths  Israeli strikes on Gaza killed at least 2 778 people and wounded 9 700  according to the Gaza Health Ministry  Nearly two thirds of those killed were children  a ministry official said  Another 1 200 people across Gaza are believed to be buried under the rubble  alive or dead  health authorities said Hamas  October 7  attack in southern Israel killed more than 1 400 people  mostly civilians  and resulted in some 200 being taken captive into Gaza  Hamas militants in Gaza have launched rockets every day since  aiming at cities across Israel Hundreds of Palestinians flooded the streets of major West Bank cities including Ramallah  the seat of the Palestinian Authority  where protesters hurled stones at Palestinian security forces who fired back with stun grenades  Others threw stones at Israeli checkpoints  where soldiers killed one Palestinian  West Bank authorities said Elsewhere  hundreds of people joined protests that erupted in Beirut and Amman  where an angry crowd gathered outside the Israeli Embassy Abbas  whose Palestinian Authority exercises limited autonomy in parts of the occupied West Bank  had cancelled his participation in the summit earlier in the day to protest the hospital blast He blamed Israel for the destruction  calling it “a massacre that cannot be tolerated or allowed to pass without accountability ”With tens of thousands of troops massed along the border  Israel has been expected to launch a ground invasion into Gaza  but its plans remained uncertain “We are preparing for the next stages of war ” military spokesman Lt  Col  Richard Hecht said  “We haven t said what they will be  Everybody s talking about a ground offensive  It might be something different ”Throughout the day Tuesday  airstrikes killed dozens of civilians and at least one senior Hamas figure in the southern half of the Gaza Strip  where the Israeli military told fleeing Palestinians to go  An Associated Press reporter saw around 50 bodies brought to Nasser Hospital after strikes in the southern city of Khan Younis The Israeli military said it was targeting Hamas hideouts  infrastructure and command centres An airstrike in Deir al Balah reduced a house to rubble  killing a man and 11 women and children inside and in a neighboring house  some of whom had evacuated from Gaza City  Witnesses said there was no warning before the strike Shelling from Israeli tanks hit a UN school in central Gaza where 4 000 Palestinians had taken refuge  killing six people and wounding dozens  the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency said  At least 24 U N  Installations have been hit the past week  killing at least 14 members of the agency s staff A barrage of strikes crashed into the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza  levelling an entire block of homes and causing dozens of casualties  residents said  Among those killed was one of Hamas  top military commanders  Ayman Nofal  the group s military wing said   the highest profile militant known to have been killed in the war In Gaza City  Israeli airstrikes also hit the house of Hamas  top political official  Ismail Haniyeh  killing at least 14 people  Haniyeh is based in Doha  Qatar  but his family lives in Gaza City  The Hamas media office did not immediately identify those killed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sought to put the blame on Hamas for Israel s retaliatory attacks and the rising civilian casualties in Gaza  “Not only is it targeting and murdering civilians with unprecedented savagery  it s hiding behind civilians ” he said With Israel barring entry of most water  fuel and food into Gaza since Hamas  brutal attack  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken secured an agreement with Netanyahu to discuss creation of a mechanism for delivering aid to the territory s 2 3 million people  US officials said the gain might appear modest  but stressed that it was a significant step forward Still  as of late Tuesday  there was no deal in place  A top Israeli official said his country was demanding guarantees that Hamas militants would not seize any aid deliveries  Tzahi Hanegbi  head of Israel s National Security Council  suggested entry of aid also depended on the return of hostages held by Hamas More than 1 million Palestinians have fled their homes   roughly half of Gaza s population   and 60 per cent are now in the approximately 14 kilometre  8 mile  long area south of the evacuation zone  the UN said At the Rafah crossing  Gaza s only connection to Egypt  truckloads of aid had been waiting to enter for more than a day  The World Food Program said that it had more than 300 tons of food waiting to cross into Gaza        Israel intensified its bombardments of the Gaza Strip on Monday after declaring war and vowing to destroy the “military and governing capabilities” of the enclave s Hamas rulers  as Israeli soldiers fought to secure the border and dislodge Gaza gunmen from areas of southern Israel At least 700 people have reportedly been killed in Israel   a staggering toll on a scale the country has not experienced in decades   and more than 400 have been killed in Gaza Palestinian militant groups claimed to be holding over 130 captives from the Israeli side More than two days after Hamas launched its unprecedented incursion out of Gaza  Israeli forces were still battling militants holed up in several locations As Monday began  the military said it was fighting Hamas in “seven to eight” places in southern Israel Military spokesperson Richard Hecht said it was taking longer than expected to repel the incursion because there were still multiple breaches in the border  which Hamas could be using to bring in more fighters and weapons  “We thought this morning we d be in a better place ” Hecht said The Israeli Defence Forces said that 70 additional militants infiltrated Be eri kibbutz  which the military has been unable to wrest from Hamas  overnight Meanwhile  Israel hit more than 1 000 targets in Gaza  its military said  including airstrikes that leveled much of the town of Beit Hanoun in the enclave s northeast corner Israeli Rear Adm  Daniel Hagari told reporters Hamas was using the town as a staging ground for attacks There was no immediate word on casualties  and most of the community s population of tens of thousands likely fled beforehand “We will continue to attack in this way  with this force  continuously  on all gathering  places  and routes” used by Hamas  Hagari said The declaration of war portended greater fighting ahead  and a major question was whether Israel would launch a ground assault into Gaza  a move that in the past has brought intensified casualties An Israeli military spokesperson said that the army had called up around 100 000 reservists  and said in a statement that Israel would aim to end Hamas  rule of Gaza “Our task is to make sure that Hamas will no longer have any military capabilities to threaten Israel with this ” said spokesperson Jonathan Conricus in a video tweeted by Israel s military “And in addition to that  we will make sure that Hamas is no longer able to govern the Gaza Strip ”After breaking through Israeli barriers with explosives at daybreak Saturday  the Hamas gunmen rampaged for hours  gunning down civilians and snatching people in towns  along highways and at a techno music festival attended by thousands in the desert The rescue service Zaka said it removed about 260 bodies from the festival  and that number was expected to rise  It was not clear how many of those bodies were already included in Israel s overall toll The Israeli military estimated 1 000 Hamas fighters took part in Saturday s initial incursion The high figure underscored the extent of planning by the militant group ruling Gaza  which has said it launched the attack in response to mounting Palestinian suffering under Israel s occupation and blockade of Gaza Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad group claimed to have taken captive more than 130 people from inside Israel and brought them into Gaza  saying they would be traded for the release of thousands of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel The announcement  though unconfirmed  was the first sign of the scope of abductions The captives are known to include soldiers and civilians  including women  children and older adults  mostly Israelis but also some people of other nationalities  The Israeli military said only that the number of captives is “significant ”Civilians on both sides were already paying a high price  The Israeli military was evacuating at least five towns close to Gaza  while the UN more than 123 000 Gazans were displaced by the fighting Mayyan Zin  a divorced mother of two  said she learned that her two daughters had been abducted when a relative sent her photos from a Telegram group showing them sitting on mattresses in captivity She then found online videos of a chilling scene in her ex husband s home in the town of Nahal Oz  Gunmen who had broken in speak to him  his leg bleeding  in the living room near the two terrified  weeping daughters  Dafna  15  and Ella  8 Another video showed the father being taken across the border into Gaza “Just bring my daughters home and to their family  All the people ” Zin said In Gaza  a tiny enclave of 2 3 million people sealed off by an Israeli Egyptian blockade for 16 years since the Hamas takeover  residents feared further escalation As of late Sunday  Israeli airstrikes had destroyed 159 housing units across Gaza and severely damaged 1 210 others  the UN said The UN agency for Palestinian refugees  UNRWA  said a school sheltering more than 225 people took a direct hit  It did not say where the fire came from In the Palestinian city of Rafah in southern Gaza  an Israeli airstrike early Monday killed 19 people  including women and children  said Talat Barhoum  a doctor at the local Al Najjar Hospital Barhoum said aircraft hit the home of the Abu Hilal family  and that one of those killed was Rafaat Abu Hilal  a leader of a local armed group  The strike caused damage to surrounding homes Over the weekend  another airstrike on a home in Rafah killed 19 members of the Abu Outa family  including women and children  when they were huddling on the ground floor in the southern Gaza city of Rafah  survivors said Several Israeli media outlets  citing rescue service officials  said at least 700 people have been killed in Israel  including 44 soldiers The Gaza Health Ministry said 413 people  including 78 children and 41 women  were killed in the territory  Some 2 000 people have been wounded on each side  An Israeli official said security forces have killed 400 militants and captured dozens more Over the weekend  the Israeli Security Cabinet declared war and approved “significant military steps” in response to the Hamas attack The steps were not defined  but the declaration appears to give the military and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a wide mandate In a statement  Netanyahu s office said the aim will be the destruction of Hamas  “military and governing capabilities” to an extent that prevents it from threatening Israelis “for many years ”The declaration of war was largely symbolic  said Yohanan Plesner  the head of the Israel Democracy Institute  a think tank  but it “demonstrates that the government thinks we are entering a more lengthy  intense and significant period of war ”Israel has carried out major military campaigns over the past four decades in Lebanon and Gaza that it portrayed as wars  but without a formal declaration The presence of hostages in Gaza complicates Israel s response  Israel has a history of making heavily lopsided exchanges to bring captive Israelis home An Egyptian official said Israel sought help from Cairo to ensure the safety of the hostages Egypt also spoke with both sides about a potential cease fire  but Israel was not open to a truce “at this stage ” according to the official  who asked not to be identified because he was not authorised to brief media In northern Israel  a brief exchange of strikes with Lebanon s Hezbollah militant group fanned fears that the fighting could expand into a wider regional war Hezbollah fired rockets and shells Sunday at Israeli positions in a disputed area along the border  and Israel fired back using armed drones  The Israeli military said the situation was calm after the exchange Elsewhere  six Palestinians were killed in clashes with Israeli soldiers Sunday around the West Bank Over the past year  Israel s far right government has ramped up settlement construction in the occupied West Bank Israeli settler violence has displaced hundreds of Palestinians there  and tensions have flared around the Al Aqsa mosque  a flashpoint Jerusalem holy site        Israel s defence minister has ordered a “complete siege” on the Gaza Strip following an unprecedented incursion into Israel by Hamas fighters Israel formally declared war on Sunday and gave the green light for “significant military steps” to retaliate against Hamas for Saturday s surprise attack More than 1 100 people have been killed and thousands wounded on both sides The defence minister s announcement on Monday came as Israel s military scoured the country s south for Hamas fighters and guarded breaches in its border fence with tanks while pounding Gaza from the air A spokesperson said the Israeli military regained control of border communities taken by Hamas fighters during the attack  But Palestinian militants continued firing barrages of rockets  setting off air raid sirens in Jerusalem and

at finalising an agreement on the trade “The Egyptian government is presently awaiting responses from both parties regarding the proposed prisoners exchange and a temporary cease fire ” Al Ahram said Palestinian militant groups have claimed to be holding over 130 people who were captured in Israel in the past two days Hamas spokesman Abdel Latif al Qanoua told The Associated Press by phone that the group s fighters had captured more Israelis as recently as Monday morning He said the group aims to free all Palestinian prisoners held by Israel  which in the past has agreed to lopsided exchanges LEBANON URGES INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO PRESSURE ISRAELLebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said Monday that the tiny country s priority is to maintain stability along its southern border with Israel following an exchange of attacks between Israeli troops and Hezbollah militants over the weekend Hezbollah claimed responsibility for firing rockets at three Israeli positions in a disputed territory along the border of the Israeli occupied Syrian Golan Heights  before Israel returned fire Mikati called on the international community to “take responsibility” in pressuring Israel to return to peace talks under the Arab Peace Initiative “Anything other than that is a further spiraling of violence that will not benefit anyone ” he said Iran backed Hezbollah has praised key ally Hamas for its unprecedented incursion into Israel but not said if it would attempt to join forces Israel has estimated that Hezbollah has some 150 000 rockets and missiles aimed at the country EUROPEAN NATIONS REPATRIATE CITIZENS WITH FLIGHTS FROM ISRAELGovernments and airlines in Europe are conducting emergency and regular flights from Israel to bring back European citizens who

Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday “We believe that this situation needs to be put onto a peaceful track as soon as possible  And the continuation of such a spiral of violence  of course  is

Tuesday said it does not attribute threat notifications  such as the ones received by some MPs belonging to Opposition parties  to any specific state sponsored attackers and that it cannot provide information on what causes such warnings After some of the most vocal critics of the government said they received warnings that attempts have been made by state sponsored attackers to steal information from their iPhones  Apple in a statement stated it is possible that some threat notifications may be false alarms and some attacks may not be detected  Apple does not attribute the threat notifications to any specific state sponsored attacker   the firm said State sponsored attackers  it said  are  very well funded and sophisticated  and their attacks evolve over time   Detecting such attacks relies on threat intelligence signals that are often imperfect and incomplete  It s possible that some Apple threat notifications may be false alarms  or that some attacks are not detected   it said It  however  refused to say what triggered warnings received by MPs  such as Mahua Moitra of TMC  We are unable to provide information about what causes us to issue threat notifications  as that may help state sponsored attackers adapt their behaviour to evade detection in the future   Apple said Meanwhile  sources privy to the development said Apple has sent threat notifications to individuals whose accounts are in nearly 150 countries Several opposition leaders on Tuesday claimed they had received an alert from Apple warning them of  state sponsored attackers trying to remotely compromise  their iPhones and posted purported screenshots of the message on their X handles Shiv Sena  UBT  MP Priyanka Chaturvedi  Trinamool Congress  Mahua Moitra  Aam Aadmi Party s Raghav Chadha

away on Saturday at his Pacific Palisades residence  He was found unresponsive in his hot tub and was believed to have drowned  No official cause or contributing factors to his death have been established yet “We are heartbroken by the tragic loss of our beloved son and brother  Matthew brought so much joy to the world  both as an actor and a friend  You all meant so much to him and we appreciate the tremendous outpouring of love   Perry s family told TMZ According to the publication   the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner will prepare an official report on the 54 year old actor s death Perry shot to international fame with popular sitcom  Friends  for his portrayal of the socially awkward but amiable Chandler Bing who used sarcasm to get by in life “Friends” co creators Marta Kauffman and David Crane  along with the show s executive producer Kevin Bright  released a joint statement expressing their shock over the sudden demise of the actor “We are shocked and deeply  deeply saddened by our beloved friend Matthew s passing  It still seems impossible  All we can say is that we feel blessed to have had him as part of our lives   the trio said in a statement to The Times They praised Perry s comedic acting abilities  highlighted throughout the show s 10 year run “He was a brilliant talent  It s a cliche to say that an actor makes a role their own  but in Matthew

intelligence he brought to every moment   not just to his work  but in life as well  He was always the funniest person in the room  More than that  he was the sweetest  with a giving and selfless heart ”Besides his work on  Friends   Perry s credits include films such as  Fools Rush In  and  The Whole Nine Yards   In 2015  he played Oscar for a CBS reboot of  The Odd Couple  that aired for two seasons In 2021  the actor appeared on HBO Max s  Friends  reunion special along with Aniston  Cox  Kudrow  Schwimmer  and LeBlanc        With an Israeli ground offensive in Gaza looming large  Israel has said it will step up its aerial strikes in the besieged Palestinian territory to create the “best conditions” for troops to move in Indicating Israel s preparations for the second stage of its declared three phase operation to change the security regime in Gaza  Israel Defence Forces  IDF  spokesperson Daniel Hagari said  “We have to enter the next phase of the war in the best conditions  not according to what anyone tells us ” “From today  we are increasing the strikes and minimizing the danger ” Hagari told reporters on Saturday  in a clear signal towards an imminent ground incursion In another clear indicator that Israel was preparing for the second stage of its three phase operation to change the “security regime” in Gaza  IDF’s Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi told commanders of the elite Golani infantry brigade earlier on Saturday that they should expect surprises prepared by terror groups when they enter the Gaza Strip “We will enter the Gaza Strip  We will begin an operational and professional mission to destroy the Hamas operatives  the Hamas infrastructure  and we will also keep in our minds the images  the scenes and the fallen from Shabbat  Saturday  two weeks ago ” Halevi told the commanders He was referring to the latest conflict  triggered by the unprecedented attacks against Israel by Hamas militants on October 7  which killed around 1 400 people  Israel has launched a massive counter offensive against the Islamic militant group that has ruled Gaza since 2007 “Gaza is complex  Gaza is dense  the enemy is preparing a lot of things there  but we are preparing things for them as well ” the IDF chief said Earlier this week  Defence Minister Yoav Gallant laid out Israel s plan to change the “security regime  in Gaza   implying Hamas  removal   and said the plan was designed in three stages The IDF was currently in the first stage of the plan when it was carrying out aerial strikes  It will be followed by ground incursion and finally  the change of security regime in Gaza  Gallant said Israel has amassed hundreds of thousands of troops in preparations for the ground offensive More than 1 400 people were killed in Israel in the deadly terror attack carried out by the Palestinian militant group in the south of the Jewish state  and at least 210 were taken captive  a number that is likely to go further up as per official estimates Around 4 385 Palestinians are said to have been killed in Gaza in the Israeli offensive that followed         Police on Friday detained members of different organisations who were trying to demonstrate in support of Palestine at New Delhi s Jantar Mantar There was no permission for the protest  police said The protesters reached the Jantar Mantar carrying posters  placards and raising slogans  The policemen deployed at there detained them immediately before they could stage a sit in The call for protest was given by students organisation  Disha  in support of the Palestinians and to protest against the Israeli airstrikes        Israel makes no bones about its intention of flattening Gaza and massacring its civiliansIt’s becoming clearer by the day that the war declared by Israel on Gaza is meant to be against the civilians rather than Hamas  The number of bombs dropped on the people so far is proof of its intention of wiping off Palestinians from Gaza  All these attacks are in the name of defeating Hamas and are actually all about removing any sort of resistance to Israel’s occupation  It is a continuation of Israel’s policy of confiscating land without care for the people  Thus  it is yet another attempt to make Israel  ‘a Jews only’ state  This war is nothing  but a continuation of the same policy practised by the Israelis against the Palestinians for decades  Targeting civilians is a crime against humanity  yet it has been a core part of Israel s actions  In fact  during the first Nakba  catastrophe  in 1948  thousands of Palestinians were killed  countless villages were burned  and women were raped and tortured  The survivors brought with them the horror stories that they had to endure at the hands of Israeli militants  They were spared on purpose to instil fear among other Palestinians to desist from defying the dictates of Israel  A large Palestinian population was expelled and lives as refugees in neighbouring countries The people of Gaza are a mix of refugees  who fled from other parts of Palestine  who have survived the onslaught of the Armed Jews Group and who have been living under deprived conditions with the natives for the last 56 years  Gaza’s residents have been living in an ‘open prison’ since 1967 even though Israel has claimed to have withdrawn from the Gaza Strip in 2007  In fact  the entirety of Gaza is besieged from land  air  and sea by Israeli occupational forces to this present day  Making no bones about his intentions  the National security minister of Israel  Itamar Ben Gvir  stated  “The only thing that needs to enter Gaza are hundreds of tonnes of explosives from the Air Force  not an ounce of humanitarian aid ”The rocket attack on the Al Ahli hospital in Gaza City killing hundreds of Palestinians is a case in point  Israel is clearly moving ahead with its plan to vacate Gaza by instilling fear among the residents who are already at their wit s end  deprived of food  water  electricity and medical aid they have nowhere to go  just waiting for the inevitable Thus  we are witnessing a genocide unfolding in real time  This policy will fail and it will not make Israel safer nor bring peace to the region but the Palestinians would have to pay a heavy price for no fault of theirs  The highest number of fatalities in this massacre have been women and children  You do not have to watch the news and stare at the television to see dead bodies scattered all over the place  Hospitals  colleges  schools  markets  convoys  nothing is safe from the bombs that are being dropped  in fact  it is as clear as day  to see that they are purposefully being targeted  The latest weaponry is being used and tested on Palestinians and will be ready for sale  the massacre of Palestinians would be proof of the quality and help Israel’s arms industry As Guru Nanak Ji once said  “We are all human before we belong to any religion ” You do not need to be a Muslim to condemn and call for an end to this carnage  Let us be brave and human enough to condemn this massacre and trampling of human rights  Though the US has now shown some sensitivity towards the people of Gaza and brokered a deal with Israel and Egypt to deliver medical aid along with other necessary supplies  it is too little too late  Nevertheless  the US has done the right thing and the world must follow  The world community should come forward and condemn Israel in one voice else we would be witnessing the biggest crime against humanity  The writer is a South Asia based senior foreign journalist and an expert on West Asia  views expressed are personal         As she accepted an endorsement from a group called Veterans for Trump  Stacy Skinner spoke about how she got into politics because Democrats “were starting to infiltrate on the local level” Former President Donald Trump and other national Republicans often warn of takeovers by China or people crossing the US Mexico border  Skinner is running for reelection to the City Council of Johns Creek  an Atlanta suburb of about 85 000 Yet the 44 year old does not openly promote her Trump association  telling inquisitive voters in this Republican leaning enclave only that she is “conservative”  Skinner s opponent  Devon Dabney  meanwhile  faces questions about being a Democrat Going into the 2024 presidential election  the dynamics in Johns Creek and other nearby Atlanta suburbs reflect how partisan and cultural divisions that intensified since Trump s 2016 run have trickled down to local campaigns Some activists and voters now view these nominally nonpartisan contests as critical fronts in shaping the nation s identity “People have a right to know who they re voting for ” said Betsy Kramer  a Republican Party volunteer who is backing Skinner in Johns Creek  which is about 30 miles north of downtown Atlanta in Fulton County “I m not voting for a Democrat ” Kramer said  “I m concerned that if Democrats start taking over north Fulton  the whole area is going to change dramatically ”The suburbs of Georgia s largest city once anchored the state s Republican establishment  Today  they play a prime role in determining the outcomes of statewide races  In 2020  they were pivotal in Democrat Joe Biden s close victory over Trump  the Republican incumbent  in the president election This swath of the metro area has become more demographically and politically diverse over recent decades  with growth among Asian American  Black and Hispanic populations that help boost Democrats  vote totals The share of Georgia residents who identify as white and non Hispanic fell in the most recent census to 50 1 per cent  the lowest on record Additionally  some Republicans who still make up north Fulton County s electoral majority have never marched in lockstep with Trump and the tea party  a movement that opposes the Washington political establishment and espouses conservative and libertarian philosophy In 2020  Trump underperformed historical Republican advantages in the area on his way to losing Georgia by fewer than 12 000 votes out of 5 million cast  And the region once elected Brad Raffensperger  Georgia s secretary of state who bucked Trump s efforts to overturn his defeat  to the state Senate Raffensperger and Gov  Brian Kemp drew strong support here in their comfortable reelection victories last year despite furious criticism from Trump for not going along with his bid to overturn the election  Trump s efforts are now the focus of a racketeering indictment in Fulton County The national undercurrents do not mean that the usual list of hot topics at city halls has changed  It s still mostly zoning and other development rules  sales tax and property millage rates  and how best to deliver services like public safety  fire protection and garbage collection  But candidates and voters talk about old  familiar debates in a different way as partisan influences rise “We are seeing this nationalization everywhere  especially in school board elections but also extending to cities ” said Michigan State University professor Sarah Reckhow  who tracks American campaign trends Reckhow pointed to several variables  the gutting of local journalism that means voters hear mostly about national politics  voter demands revolving more around cultural hot buttons rather than traditional local policy  and low voter turnout that increases the power of the most engaged and partisan citizens “This creates a cycle ” she said  where voter preferences  media narratives and politicians  rhetoric become “kind of reinforcing” The new landscape may help explain why Skinner is circumspect about Trump and how she and Dabney are carefully navigating their partisan preferences “President Trump is obviously divisive ” said Skinner in a interview  insisting the endorsement “was about the veterans” rather than Trump himself  “Everything has gotten more divisive than I think it needs to be ”Dabney  a Black woman  nonetheless sees herself as a target  She bemoans what she says is a “whisper campaign” that casts her as a threat to Johns Creek s identity because of her voting history She acknowledged getting door knocking and other help from grassroots progressive groups in Johns Creek and Democratic activists from elsewhere but said that came only after she was being attacked by Republicans “My parents were involved in the Civil Rights Movement   she said   It s no secret that most Black people have voted for Democrats since then ”But “this is a nonpartisan election”  she said  “It shouldn t matter ”The new intensity is especially obvious in discussions over development  conversations that usually revolve around “high density” construction of apartments and condominiums Zoning has long been contentious in US suburbs  which blossomed after World War II and through the Civil Rights Movement as places for middle class and upper middle class whites to establish self contained communities set between the economic challenges of rural America and the racial and ethnic diversity of large cities  including Atlanta Now  those zoning issues are a flashpoint in partisan politics  They are reflected in national rhetoric like Trump s call to build a wall on the US Mexico border  arguments over “sanctuary cities” run by liberals and tighter federal restrictions on legal immigration “I don t want our city to become a hellhole  I don t want to become Atlanta ” said Kramer  the Johns Creek Republican  She associated Georgia s capital city with “crime” and “riffraff”  similar to how Trump once disparaged Atlanta as “crime infested” and “falling apart” Atlanta s population is 48 per cent Black and 41 per cent white  Johns Creek is about 52 per cent non Hispanic white  Asians make up about one quarter of the population and Black residents about one tenth  according to the US Census Bureau “Some of them are my very good friends ” Kramer said of Johns Creek s many nonwhite residents  But the white Boston area native  who moved to Georgia decades ago  argued that putting more Democrats in local office guarantees housing policy that would “change the demographics” “I want anybody that can come afford it to live in our city ” she said  “We live in a high rent district  and I want to keep it that way  I m not trying to keep anybody out ”In nearby Roswell  City Council candidate Jason Miller said the “high density” debate has yielded a perceived battle between “two slates” Miller  who moved to Roswell from Atlanta with his husband  is among the candidates who does not want to give developers free rein on residential high density projects  He wants to focus on business development first “I want us to be intentional     So we give more Roswell residents the opportunity to work closer to home rather than be a bedroom community that feeds Atlanta and other suburbs ” he said  “I m all about growing density  as long as we do it wisely ”Others running in Roswell  though  talk about development in the context of partisan control “The other side is about bringing in new voters ” candidate Allen Sells  a self described conservative  said at a recent event for several council hopefuls  “That s what they re all about ”Miller  describing himself as a left leaning independent  said the atmosphere leaves him miscast  with some voters associating him with “far right thinking people” and some conservatives thinking he is a “socialist” He characterised his voting history as “mostly Democratic but plenty of Republicans” but said some voters want to know his specific candidate choices and demand his take on issues that rarely  if ever  come before city government “I ve gotten emails and questions from voters asking me about my position on abortion ” he said  “It s bizarre ” Miller lamented  how the partisan mindset “filters all the way down to local elections” Indeed  at the gathering where Miller and Sells spoke  the biggest cheer of the evening came during introductions of other local elected officials  The crowd roared at the mention of Fulton County Commissioner Bridget Thorne  an outspoken conservative who won her seat after pushing the lie that widespread voter fraud marred Georgia s 2020 elections In Johns Creek  at the only event where Dabney and Skinner have shared the same stage  they staked out essentially the same approach to development  saying they would adhere to the city s existing master plan  Skinner called it “responsible development” that allows residential and business growth  Dabney lamented later that her actual positions on issues have taken a back seat “I was always well liked in the community ” she said  But once she launched her campaign  “then it s  Well  she s this Democrat  She s going to bring density and affordable housing        The Israeli military said it killed four militants wearing explosive vests attempting to cross into the country from Lebanon  its Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee said A video from a reconnaissance drone the Israeli army shared showed the militants near the separation wall before they were targeted  causing an explosion No group in Lebanon claimed immediately claimed responsibility  Last week  militants from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad in southern Lebanon crossed the border and clashed with Israeli troops  killing 3 and wounding several others  The militants were killed  and the Palestinian group held funerals for two of them Tensions have flared along the Lebanon Israel border between the Hezbollah group and Israeli military  While shelling has been limited to towns along the border  there are fears Hezbollah and other Iran backed groups would escalate their actions to support Hamas should Israel begin a ground operation in Gaza Malaysia s Anwar Warns Gaza Crisis Could Turn Into GenocideKuala Lumpur  Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim says the crisis in Gaza could turn into genocide if Israel s war against Hamas in the territory continues Anwar said Tuesday that civilian safety must be given top priority  He said he expressed Malaysia s unwavering support for the Palestinian people during a phone conversation Monday with Hamas political bureau chief  Ismail Haniyeh “Given the dire situation in Gaza  I strongly advocate for the immediate cessation of bombardment and the establishment of a humanitarian corridor in Rafah ” he wrote on social media  He urged Israel to “genuinely pursue a peaceful resolution” to end the conflict Anwar told Parliament on Monday that Malaysia rebuffed calls by Western countries to condemn Hamas for its Oct 7 incursion into Israel that set off their latest war  Malaysia blames years of injustice and Israeli oppression on the Palestinian people for the Hamas incursion “If no action is taken  it will turn into a genocide war ” he said  “If the world is unable to do anything  it means that the world is allowing the mass killing of Palestinians ”Malaysia  a moderate  mostly Muslim nation  has long been a critic of Israel s occupation of Palestinian territories  It does not have diplomatic ties with Israel Anwar plans to attend a meeting of Gulf leaders in Saudi Arabia this week and has said he would discuss the issue with his counterparts Malaysia has allocated $2 1 million to the UN relief agency helping Palestinian refugees and hopes to raise up to $22 million for Palestinian humanitarian aid Palestinians Report Heavy Shelling In Southern GazaGaza Strip  Palestinians in Gaza reported intense bombardments early Tuesday near the southern towns of Khan Younis and Rafah  where Israel ordered civilians to seek refuge Israeli bombs hit areas west and southeast of Khan Younis and west of Rafah  according to local reports  Thousands of people trying to escape Gaza are gathered in Rafah  which contains the territory s only border crossing to Egypt  as international mediators press for a deal to allow aid in and refugees with foreign passports out        The Israel’s Gaza campaign can upset many bilateral agreementsTwo world leaders in the middle of almost every geo political discussion for the past year  travelled out to their respective countries  to resolve the unfolding Israel war on terror  US President  Joe Biden travelled to Israel to express solidarity with one of its closest allies in West Asia  His next stop was Jordan where according to the white house statement  the president’s trip “reiterated that Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian people’s right to dignity and self determination and discuss the humanitarian needs of civilians in Gaza  “The President also met with leaders from Egypt  and Palestinian Authority in Amman during the trip  A careful balancing of risks involved with the President’s trip to Israel played out in the background  with several senior officials in the White House admitting about the possible PR fallout of the high level visit  The fear of a ground attack on Gaza  with US marines in the vicinity  or joining in  causing huge casualties of Palestinians  could trigger a backlash against the war against terror globally  The collective memory of people around the world is currently bombarded with visuals of human tragedy and piles of rubble  caused first by the war in Ukraine for the past year  followed by the Gaza strip  even though  many of them would have preferred  some more time to come out Covid induced economic misfortunes  Additionally  President Biden faces a tough re election next year  with political sentiments in the US on a slippery ground regarding the state number of wars America can afford  The world  particularly US citizens  may have a war fatigue  with the one in Ukraine  directly aided by billions of dollars  refusing to die down even in the second year At this juncture  for President Biden  to be drawn into a full fledged “war against terror group Hamas” in West Asia with its ally Israel  could suitably upset domestic political equations  The US has gradually pulled out from West Asia  in the past decade  leaving it up to local sovereign players to come to terms with each other’s sensitivities  The ongoing war on terror as a response to the dastardly act  caused by US recognised terror group Hamas  could pull it back to the region upsetting its existing bilateral relations with several other countries present in the vicinity  To be sure  the US led the Arab world and Israel to slowly start patching up through the Abrahm’s Accord  which involved a bunch of bilateral agreements between the countries persuaded by Washington DC to work towards a common good  The US also stitched together the I2U2 framework  which brought India  Israel and UAE to work closely on global and regional issues of concern  The current conflict in West Asia could upset some of these equations Meanwhile  Russian President Vladimir Putin landed in Beijing  his second international trip since the International Criminal Court  ICC issued an arrest warrant on him earlier this year  This trip was widely followed  as it marked the reiteration of “no limits” friendship  between Russia and China which are trying to lead a world order without the US and its allies  President Putin travelled to Beijing  immediately before he attacked Ukraine last year  Meanwhile  despite the arrest warrant  issued by ICC  President Xi landed in Moscow on a state visit and showered praises on the Russian premiere  President Putin’s trip to Beijing this week was more to support the Belt and Road Initiative which he had termed as one meant for international cooperation earlier India meanwhile has to play a tight diplomatic walk with its full fledged support to Israel for its war against terror along with the US  India has not ruptured its relations with Russia  while it continues to have abnormal relations with China due to the military conflict and is opposed to the Belt and Road Initiative  as it runs through India s acknowledged disputed territories  India is on a wait and watch  which it has done in the past on the Ukraine war  the Israel conflict may be no exception  The writer is a policy analyst  views expressed are personal        Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for a visit that underscores China s support for Moscow during its war in Ukraine as well as Russian backing for China s bid to expand its economic and diplomatic influence abroad The two countries have forged an informal alliance against the United States and other democratic nations that is now complicated by the Israel Hamas war  China has sought to balance its ties with Israel against its relations with Iran and Syria  two countries that are strongly backed by Russia and with which China has forged ties for economic reasons as well as to challenge Washington s influence in the Middle East Putin s plane was met by an honour guard as the Russian leader began his visit that is also a show of support for Chinese leader Xi Jinping s signature ‘Belt and Road  initiative to build infrastructure and expand China s overseas influence In an interview to Chinese state media  Putin praised the massive but loosely linked BRI projects “Yes  we see that some people consider it an attempt by the People s Republic of China to put someone under its thumb  but we see otherwise  we just see desire for cooperation ” he told state broadcaster CCTV  according to a transcript released by the Kremlin on Monday Putin will be among the highest profile guests at a gathering marking the 10th anniversary of Xi s announcement of the BRI project  which has laden countries such as Zambia and Sri Lanka with heavy debt from contracts with Chinese companies to build roads  airports and other public works they could not otherwise afford  U N  Secretary General Antonio Guterres has praised the Chinese policy as bringing development to neglected areas Asked by reporters Friday about his visit  Putin said it would encompass talks on Belt and Road related projects  which he said Moscow wants to link with efforts by an economic alliance of former Soviet Union nations mostly located in Central Asia to “achieve common development goals ”He also downplayed the impact of China s economic influence in a region that Russia has long considered its backyard and where it has worked to maintain political and military clout “We don t have any contradictions here  on the contrary  there is a certain synergy ” Putin said Putin said he and Xi would also discuss growing economic ties between Moscow and Beijing in energy  high tech and financial industries  China has also grown in importance as an export destination for Russia Alexander Gabuev  director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Centre  said that from China s view  “Russia is a safe neighbour that is friendly  that is a source of cheap raw materials  that s a support for Chinese initiatives on the global stage and that s also a source of military technologies  some of those that China doesn t have ”“For Russia  China is its lifeline  economic lifeline in its brutal repression against Ukraine ” Gabuev told The Associated Press “It s the major market for Russian commodities  it s a country that provides its currency and payment system to settle Russia s trade with the outside world   with China itself  but also with many other countries  and is also the major source of sophisticated technological imports  including dual use goods that go into the Russian military machine ”Gabuev said that while Moscow and Beijing will be unlikely to forge a full fledged military alliance  their defence cooperation will grow “Both countries are self sufficient in terms of security and they benefit from partnering  but neither really requires a security guarantee from the other  And they preach strategic autonomy ” he said “There will be no military alliance  but there will be closer military cooperation  more interoperability  more cooperation on projecting force together  including in places like the Arctic and more joint effort to develop a missile defence that makes the U S  Nuclear planning and planning of the U S  And its allies in Asia and in Europe more complicated ” he added The Chinese and Soviets were Cold War rivals for influence among left leaning states  but China and Russia have since partnered in the economic  military and diplomatic spheres Just weeks before Russia s invasion of Ukraine last February  Putin met with Xi in Beijing and the sides signed an agreement pledging a “no limits” relationship  Beijing s attempts to present itself as a neutral peace broker in Russia s war on Ukraine have been widely dismissed by the international community Xi visited Moscow in March as part of a flurry of exchanges between the countries  China has condemned international sanctions imposed on Russia  but hasn t directly addressed an arrest warrant issued for Putin by the International Criminal Court on charges of alleged involvement in the abductions of thousands of children from Ukraine        Hamas says Israel s heavy bombardment of the Gaza Strip has killed 13 hostages  including foreigners  held by the group Hamas  military wing said in a statement Friday that the 13 were killed in various locations over the past 24 hours It did not give the nationality of the foreigners        The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees told a UN emergency meeting Monday “an immediate humanitarian ceasefire has become a matter of life and death for millions ” accusing Israel of “collective punishment” of Palestinians and the forced displacement of civilians Philippe Lazzarini warned that a further breakdown of civil order following the looting of the agency s warehouses by Palestinians searching for food and other aid “will make it extremely difficult  if not impossible  for the largest UN agency in Gaza to continue operating ”Briefings to the Security Council by Lazzarini  the head of the UN children s agency UNICEF and a senior UN humanitarian official painted a dire picture of the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza 23 days after Hamas  surprise Oct  7 attacks in Israel  and its ongoing retaliatory military action aimed at “obliterating” the militant group  which controls Gaza According to the latest figures from Gaza s Ministry of Health  more than 8 300 people have been killed – 66 per cent of them women and children – and tens of thousands injured  the UN humanitarian office said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell that toll includes over 3 400 children killed and more than 6 300 injured  “This means that more than 420 children are being killed or injured in Gaza each day – a number which should shake each of us to our core ” she said Lazzarini said   “This surpasses the number of children killed annually across the world s conflict zones since 2019 ” And he stressed  “This cannot be  collateral damage  ”Many speakers at the council meeting denounced Hamas  October 7 surprise attacks on Israel that killed over 1 400 people  and urged the release of some 230 hostages taken to Gaza by the militants  But virtually every speaker also stressed that Israel is obligated under international humanitarian law to protect civilians and their essentials for life including hospitals  schools and other infrastructure – and Israel was criticized for cutting off food  water  fuel and medicine to Gaza and cutting communications for several days Lazzarini said “the handful of convoys” allowed into Gaza through the Rafah crossing from Egypt in recent days “is nothing compared to the needs of over 2 million people trapped in Gaza ”“The system in place to allow aid into Gaza is geared to fail   he said   unless there is political will to make the flow of supplies meaningful  matching the unprecedented humanitarian needs ”The commissioner general of the UN agency known as UNRWA said there is no safe place anywhere in Gaza  warning that basic services are crumbling  medicine  food  water and fuel are running out  and the streets “have started overflowing with sewage  which will cause a massive health hazard very soon ”UNICEF oversees water and sanitation issues for the UN  and Russell warned that “the lack of clean water and safe sanitation is on the verge of becoming a catastrophe ”US Ambassador Linda Thomas Greenfield urged the divided Security Council – which has rejected four resolutions that would have responded to the Oct  7 Hamas attacks and the ongoing war – to come together  saying “the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is growing more dire by the day ”Stressing that all innocent civilians must be protected  she said the council must call “for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages  address the immense humanitarian needs of Palestinian civilians in Gaza  affirm Israel s right to defend itself from terrorism  and remind all actors that international humanitarian law must be respected ” She reiterated President Joe Biden s call for humanitarian pauses to get hostages out  allow aid in  and safe passage for civilians “That means Hamas must not use Palestinians as human shields – an act of unthinkable cruelty and a violation of the law of war ” the US ambassador said  “and that means Israel must take all possible precautions to avoid harm to civilians ”In a sign of increasing US concern at the escalating Palestinian death toll  Thomas Greenfield told the council Biden reiterated to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday “that while Israel has the right and responsibility to defend its citizens from terrorism  it must do so in a manner consistent with international humanitarian law ”“The fact that Hamas operates within and under the cover of civilians areas creates an added burden for Israel  but it does not lessen its responsibility to distinguish between terrorists and innocent civilians ” she stressed Following the rejection of the four resolutions in the 15 member Security Council – one vetoed by the US  one vetoed by Russia and China  and two for failing to get the minimum nine “yes” votes – Arab nations went to the UN General Assembly last Friday where there are no vetoes The 193 member world body adopted a resolution calling for humanitarian truces leading to a cessation of hostilities by a vote of 120 14 with 45 abstentions  Now  the 10 elected members in the 15 member Security Council are trying again to negotiate a resolution that won t be rejected  While council resolutions are legally binding  assembly resolutions are not though they are an important barometer of world opinion        US President Joe Biden has said that he is convinced that one of the reasons why Hamas launched a terrorist attack on Israel was because of the recent announcement during the G 20 Summit in New Delhi on the ambitious India Middle East Europe Economic Corridor that integrates the entire region with a network of railroad Israel has launched a massive counter offensive against Hamas after unprecedented attacks by the militant group on October 7 killed more than 1 400 people Biden told reporters at a joint news conference with the visiting Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese that his analysis is based on his instinct and does not have any proof for this “I m convinced one of the reasons Hamas attacked when they did  and I have no proof of this  just my instinct tells me  is because of the progress we were making towards regional integration for Israel  and regional integration overall  We can t leave that work behind ” Biden said This is the second time in less than a week that Biden has mentioned the India Middle East Europe Economic Corridor  IMEEC  as a potential reason for the terrorist attack by Hamas The new economic corridor  which many see as an alternative to China s Belt and Road Initiative  was jointly announced by the leaders of the US  India  Saudi Arabia  the United Arab Emirates  France  Germany  Italy and the European Union on the sidelines of the G20 summit in September The corridor comprises an eastern corridor connecting India to the Gulf region and a northern corridor connecting the Gulf region to Europe Biden said in the past few weeks  he has spoken to leaders throughout the region  including King Abdullah of Jordan  President Sisi of Egypt  President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority  and Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia about making sure there s real hope in the region for a better future about the need to work toward a greater integration for Israel while insisting that the aspirations of the Palestinian people will be part  will be part of that future as well        The leader of Lebanon s Hezbollah group held talks on Wednesday with senior Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad figures in a key meeting of three top anti Israel militant groups amid the war raging in Gaza A brief statement following the meeting said that Hezbollah s leader Hassan Nasrallah agreed with Hamas  Saleh al Arouri and Islamic Jihad s leader Ziad al Nakhleh on the next steps that the three   along with other Iran backed militants   should take at this “sensitive stage  Their goal  according to the statement that was carried on Hezbollah run and Lebanese state media  was to achieve “a real victory for the resistance in Gaza and Palestine” and halt Israel s  treacherous and brutal aggression against our oppressed and steadfast people in Gaza and the West Bank” No other details were provided  The discussions in Beirut came as the war between Israel and Hamas  the Palestinian militant group that rules the Gaza Strip  is now in its third week The fighting  triggered by Hamas  deadly incursion into Israel on October 7 that killed more than 1 400 people in Israel  has killed more than 5 700 Palestinians in Gaza As the Gaza death toll spirals  tensions have also been rising along the tense Lebanon Israel border  where Hezbollah members have been exchanging fire with Israeli troops since the day after Hamas  rampage into Israel For now  those exchanges remain limited to a handful of border towns and Hezbollah and Israeli military positions on both sides  Lebanese army soldiers and United Nations peacekeeping forces have deployed in large numbers Dozens of Hezbollah fighters have been killed in the clashes so far  the group says  while the Israeli military has also announced some deaths among its ranks Nasrallah has yet to publicly speak about the war in Gaza and clashes along the Lebanon Israel border  However  other Hezbollah top officials have warned Israel against its planned ground invasion into the besieged territory Israeli officials have said they would retaliate aggressively in case of a cross border attack by Hezbollah from Lebanon “We will cripple it with a force it cannot even imagine  and the consequences for it and the Lebanese state  will be  devastating   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said while visiting Israeli troops along the border with Lebanon on Sunday Lebanon s cash strapped caretaker government  along regional and international figures  has been scrambling to keep the country out of the war Hezbollah and Israel fought a month long war in 2006 that ended in a tense stalemate  Israel sees Iran backed Hezbollah as its most serious threat  estimating it has some 150 000 rockets and missiles aimed at Israel        Ten Nepali students have been killed and four others injured in Israel after the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a wave of rocket attacks in the country s southern region  Nepal s foreign ministry said on Monday Hamas carried out a barrage of air strikes in Southern Israel on Saturday  killing over 600 people  including soldiers  and wounding more than 1 900 The Israel Defense Forces  IDF  in response launched multiple attacks targeting Hamas  key infrastructure  About 1 000 people have been killed in Israel and Gaza in the biggest escalation in decades between the two sides In a press statement  the foreign ministry here said 10 Nepali nationals lost their lives in the recent attack by Hamas in Israel Out of the 17 Nepali nationals working on a farm at Kibbutz Alumim  an area near the Gaza Strip  two safely escaped  four were injured and one is still missing  it said  We have received the information of the sad demise of ten Nepali nationals from the site  where the Hamas had launched an attack ” Nepal s embassy in Jerusalem said in a statement All 10 people killed in the Hamas attack were students of agriculture from Sudur Paschim University in Western Nepal  according to ministry sources There are currently 4 500 Nepali nationals working as caregivers in Israel  A total of 265 Nepali students are studying in Israel under the ‘Learn and Earn  programme of the Israeli government  Of them  119 are from Agriculture and Forestry University

made to search for one missing student  The bodies will be brought back to Nepal soon after the identification is completed ” the embassy said The Nepal government has also requested the Israeli government that necessary arrangements be provided to the injured people  who are undergoing treatment The ministry said it was collaborating with the Israeli government and the embassy in Tel Aviv to bring back those nationals who want to return home “Nepal government is committed to evacuate its nationals from the war torn region at the earliest ” said the statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs “A meeting of the coordination mechanism formed under the leadership of Foreign Minister N P Saud is underway at the ministry to take stock of the situation in Israel  to identify Nepalese nationals and to make efforts for rescue Nepalese nationals if necessary ” read the statement issued by secretariat of Foreign Minster Saud Nepal s main opposition CPN UML has also asked Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal to talk to his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu to rescue the Nepalis  the Kathmandu Post newspaper reported “Issuing statements and informing the House is not enough  The government must play the role of guardian of its citizens at this time of crisis ” said Padam Giri  the UML chief whip  in Parliament The death toll in Israel is expected to rise as a large number of people have been critically wounded  according to the Israeli military Palestinian health officials have said that more than 400 people have been killed  with over 2 000 injured Hamas is a Palestinian Islamist militant group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007  The Gaza Strip is home to about 2 3 million people  It is a 41km long and 10km wide territory surrounded by Israel
