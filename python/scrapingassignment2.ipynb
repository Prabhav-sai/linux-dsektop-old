      "By Ted HessonWASHINGTON (Reuters) –     The attack by Hamas on Israel will inspire the most significant terror threat to the U.S. since the rise of ISIS nearly a decade ago, FBI Director Christopher Wray said at a congressional hearing on Tuesday.\n",
      "Wray said that since the start of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in Gaza earlier this month, multiple foreign terrorist organizations have called for attacks against Americans and the West, significantly raising the threat posed by homegrown U.S. violent extremists.\n",
      "“The actions of Hamas and its allies will serve as an inspiration the likes of which we haven’t seen since ISIS launched its so-called caliphate several years ago,” Wray said.\n",
      "The remarks came during a hearing before the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee focused on threats to the United States. The U.S. government has seen an increase in threats against Jews, Muslims and Arab Americans since fighting broke out in Gaza, U.S. officials have said.During the hearing, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said that hate directed at Jewish students in the U.S. following the start of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in Gaza has added to an increase in antisemitism.\n",
      "The White House expressed alarm this week at reports of anti-Jewish incidents at U.S. universities. Tensions between pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian groups have sprung up on some U.S. campuses, including several in New York, prompting university officials to tighten security.\n",
      "“Hate directed at Jewish students, communities, and institutions add to a preexisting increase in the level of antisemitism in the United States and around the world,” Mayorkas said.\n",
      "At a ransomware summit organized by the White House on Tuesday, Attorney General Merrick Garland said he had directed the U.S. Justice Department to assist Israeli investigators probing financial flows to Hamas, including those involving cryptocurrency.

      " New Delhi, Oct 28 (PTI) With India abstaining on a United Nations resolution on the Israel-Hamas conflict, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Saturday asserted that the move goes against everything the country has stood for, remarks that drew a sharp response from the BJP which stressed that India will never be on the side of terrorism.\n",
      " India on Friday abstained from voting in the UN General Assembly on a Jordan-drafted resolution titled ‘protection of civilians and upholding legal and humanitarian obligations’ that called for an immediate humanitarian truce in the Israel-Hamas conflict and unhindered humanitarian access in the Gaza strip.\n",
      " The 193-member General Assembly adopted the resolution that called for an immediate, durable and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities.\n",
      " In a post on X, Priyanka Gandhi quoted Mahatma Gandhi’s “an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind” to drive home her point. “I am shocked and ashamed that our country has abstained from voting for a ceasefire in Gaza,” Priyanka Gandhi said.\n",
      " “Our country was founded on the principles of non-violence and truth, principles for which our freedom fighters laid down their lives, these principles form the basis of the constitution that defines our nationhood,” she said.  They represent the moral courage of India that guided its actions as a member of the international community, she added.\n",
      " “To refuse to take a stand and watch in silence as every law of humanity is pulverized, food, water, medical supplies, communication and power is cut off to millions of people and thousands of men, women and children in Palestine are being annihilated goes against everything our country has stood for throughout its life as a nation,” Priyanka Gandhi said.\n",
      " Reacting to Priyanka Gandhi’s response, senior BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said those who are “ashamed and shocked” must realise that India will never be on the side of terrorism. “India’s Explanation of Vote – spelt this out categorically. Our position on the Israel – Palestine issue is steadfast and consistent. Those who choose to side with terror do so at their own peril…,” the former minority affairs minister said on X.\n",
      " “On a lighter note, Priyanka Ji, you should first educate yourself on things that are put out from your X account. Looks like people, who have no idea of Congress’s past positions on the situation, are advising you,” he said.\n",
      " “What is worse is that in an attempt to make you look ‘better’ than Rahul, they are making you look silly,” Naqvi added.\n",
      " The CPI(M) and the CPI said in a joint statement that India abstaining from voting on a United Nations resolution calling for a truce in Gaza is “shocking” and shows that Indian foreign policy is now shaped by “being a subordinate ally of US imperialism”. Communist Party of India (Marxist) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury and CPI General Secretary D Raja said in the statement — titled ‘Stop this Genocidal Aggression in Gaza’ — that India’s move negates its long-standing support to the Palestinian cause.\n",
      " India has said terrorism is a “malignancy” and knows no borders, nationality or race and the world should not buy into any justification of terror acts, as it abstained on a resolution on the Israel-Hamas conflict.  The resolution, which garnered 121 votes in favour, 44 abstentions and 14 member states voting against it, also demanded the immediate, continuous, sufficient and unhindered provision of essential goods and services to civilians throughout the Gaza Strip.\n",
      " According to media reports, the rising death toll in Gaza is unprecedented in the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  The Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza said Thursday that more than 7,000 Palestinians have died in the conflict.  Over 1,400 people were killed in the unprecedented attacks on Israel by Hamas on October 7. Hamas has held more than 220 people hostage in Gaza.  Israel then launched retaliatory strikes which left a trail of death and destruction. PTI ASK SMN\n",

      "Fingers curled around the handles of their famous two-hand steel-and-carbon Dadao swords, others equipped with nothing but bodies hardened by years of martial arts training, the men of Lieutenant-General Song Zheyuan’s 29 Corps made their way along the woodcutters’ trails below the Great Wall of China. For two days, they had been fighting medieval-style melees with Imperial Japan’s forces on the wall’s ramparts and fortified gateways. Now, General Song was preparing to take death into the enemy camp.\n",
      "The men of the 29 Corps, historian Jiashun Du has recorded, slaughtered the Imperial Japanese soldiers in their beds, destroyed artillery guns with grenades, and set ammunition dumps on fire. Then, as morning broke on 3 January 1933, the Chinese disappeared into the morning mist. For the very last time, the Great Wall—left in disrepair since the Manchu invasion breached it in 1644—had defeated China’s enemies.\n",
      "Hamas’s easy defeat of Israel’s so-called Iron Wall with Gaza—twin lines of six metre high barbed wire fences, made from a 140,000 tons of iron and steel, backed up with an underground concrete skirt to block tunnels, and a dense array of radar, thermal cameras, movement sensors and remotely-operated machine-guns—has set military planners across the world wondering if modern static defences are again as useless as the Great Walls which guarded medieval empires.\n",
      "For decades after the Second World War, static defences—like the supposedly-impervious Maginot Line breached by Nazi Germany in 1940 or the Atlantic Wall pulverised by the Allies in 1944—indeed seemed a folly of history. Today, though, they have returned as critical elements of border defence around the world, from the southwestern borders of the United States to India’s frontiers in Kashmir and Bangladesh.Though India is testing a smart fence in Kashmir—using, government sources say, sensors from Magal, which also developed the systems in Gaza and the United States—problems with infiltration remain. In recent weeks, jihadist units have shown the ability to penetrate the fence, strike and exfiltrate their personnel.\n",
      "Fencing of the Line of Control, and the introduction of technologies like thermal imaging and ground-movement sensors, do not appear to have evident correlation with terrorist infiltration, official data shows.\n",
      "Hamas’s ability to overwhelm the Gaza fences poses a stark question: Do these multi-million dollar fences really work?\n",
      "Also read: Gaza’s Islamist wave can fuel jihadism in India—Don’t forget the ‘Silk Letter Movement’France’s long, murderous counterinsurgency campaign in Algeria holds the key to understanding how border fences were reborn. Even with air support, a naval blockade and unsubtle arm-twisting of the governments of Tunisia and Morocco, French forces had little luck interdicting Front de Libération Nationale (FLN) fighters and equipment. There was reluctance to mine the border, since insurgents in Vietnam had shown considerable skill in digging them out, and using them against the military.\n",
      "Lacking other options, France strung out a fence but it wasn’t a roseate success. In 1956, US military officer Timothy Bairstow records, the FLN removed a 5-km stretch, tauntingly leaving behind a page from a French military manual which read,“any obstacle not covered by fire is ineffective.”\n",
      "The final French fence, the Morice Line, proved a formidable obstacle, though. Electrified with a 5,000-volt charge, powered by stations put up every 15 to 20 km, the Morice Line was also defended by modified naval surveillance radar. The French improved their reaction times to breaches by building roads, and using airborne forces. FLN infiltration was reduced to small groups.\n",
      "Elsewhere in the world, similar efforts failed. The Rhodesian counterinsurgency cordon sanitaire, scholar Martin Rupiah notes, failed because the government lacked enough troops to effectively patrol it. Zimbabwean insurgents were able to clear the minefields using spades in just two hours. False alerts from the early warning system, caused by weather conditions, contributed to the system’s ineffectiveness.Forts, electronic sensors and airborne surveillance were extensively used by the US military to monitor the movements of insurgents and traffickers across Iraq’s borders with Syria and Iran. The effort, expert Robert Bateman notes, was shackled from the outset by the fact that the US could never build up the necessary density of troops to respond to electronic intelligence. The costs of this were brutal as the Islamic State overwhelmed large parts of the territory after 2006.\n",
      "The lesson, from Algeria to Iraq, was simple: Even though fences could be a useful tool in securing borders, there was no tech-fix to the problem of getting enough troops on the ground. Left unmanned, even the most lethal minefields and fences could be penetrated.\n",
      "Also read: The next front in the Israel-Hamas war will be Europe\n",
      "From the evidence available so far, Israel forgot that lesson—in part because of the ideological priorities of its political leadership. Three entire battalions of soldiers, journalist Gershom Gorenberg has revealed, were moved to the West Bank on October 4, only to protect a convoy of Jewish worshippers to St. Joseph’s Tomb in Nablus, a contested religious site. Large numbers of troops were thinned from Gaza, and frittered away in small pockets guarding settlements in the West Bank.The Knesset’s powerful Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, Gorenberg writes, did not hold a single meeting on Gaza—devoting its sessions, instead, to the issue of securing settlements and the roads between them.\n",
      "Hamas began by bombarding Israeli observation posts and remote-controlled machine guns with drones, built on cheap, easily available commercial platforms. Even as Israeli command posts were blinded, it blew apart the fence with Bangalore torpedos—simple pipes filled with explosives—and rolled bulldozers through the gaps.\n",
      "As the scholar Franz-Stefan Gady has argued, Israel became victim to a tech fetish, imagining devices could substitute for soldiers trained and prepared to fight wars. There was an important second lesson, too: Enemies constantly learn lessons from reverses, and find ways to overcome barriers.\n",

      "Five years after former US president Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant wall began going up on the country’s southwestern border, the Department of Homeland Security conducted studies that give some idea of their effectiveness. The number of so-called “gotaways”—“the number of subjects who, after making an unlawful entry, are not turned back or apprehended”, as defined by the DHS—rose from 85,505 in 2011 to 389,155 in 2021.\n",
      "The number of successful turnbacks, or potential migrants the DHS stopped, also rose, but far more modestly—from 121,007 to 174,320 in 2021.\n",
      "Few statistical studies of the kind conducted by the DHS—after prolonged prodding from the state auditor, Government Accountability Office—have been conducted elsewhere in the world. The DHS knew how many people it was arresting, but had no estimates of how many evaded its border defences. This has made assessment of the effectiveness of fencing almost impossible.Ever since the 1940s, when the United States first began fencing the southwestern border to cut back illegal immigration, little evidence had emerged that the strategy could be successful. Efforts to close the border in 1969 and 1985 came to nothing. \n",
      "Former president Ronald Reagan, who presided over that second closure, earlier suggested that “rather than talking about putting up a fence, why don’t we work out some recognition of our mutual problems, make it possible for them to come here legally with a work permit.”\n",
      "Even as Trump spent billions of dollars on the high-tech wall—a policy that has continued under President Joe Biden—traffickers applied private-sector ingenuity to circumvent the defences. The methods range from ladders and tunnels, to devices which allow four-wheelers to climb over the border wall. Trafficking cartels are also using drones to probe for gaps in the movements of border patrols.\n",
      "Trained terrorists have little difficulty in circumventing obstacles that don’t deter drug traffickers or illegal immigrants. As early as 2018, arrested Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist Zabiullah Saqib told Indian interrogators that it took his unit of six just 30 minutes to penetrate the coils of concertina wire piled up on the Line of Control. Large parts of the fence are also damaged by heavy snowfall each winter, creating gaps that are not repaired until the spring.Learning from the experience of Israel, India needs to be ready for the prospect that terrorists will find new means to test its preparedness on the Line of Control. The jihadist resurgence in Pakistan’s northwest could, for example, lead to India confronting large groups of well-trained insurgents rather than just small-unit infiltration. Technology cannot substitute for the training and preparedness that allow resilience in the face of surprise.\n",

      "New Delhi: The Congress condemned the Hamas attack on Israel while also denouncing Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, former party president Sonia Gandhi wrote in a column for a leading English daily. Her column came close on the heels of Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge taking a similar line, after the party went back and forth on its stance on the issue.\n",
      "In her column for The Hindu, Sonia Gandhi stated that the Congress’s stand on the issue was “long standing” and “principled”. She also criticised the government’s decision to abstain from voting on a resolution moved by Jordan at the UN General Assembly calling for an “immediate” ceasefire in Gaza.\n",
      "“…it is to support direct negotiations for a sovereign, independent, viable and secure state of Palestine coexisting in peace with Israel. This is also the stand taken by the Ministry of External Affairs on October 12, 2023,” she wrote.\n",
      "Gandhi added that it is “noteworthy that a reiteration of India’s historic position on Palestine came only after Israel began its assault on Gaza”. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, she wrote, “made no mention of Palestinian rights in the initial statement expressing complete solidarity with Israel” — referring to the Prime Minister’s initial reaction to the attack by Hamas.\n",
      "Her take on the issue comes at a time when the Congress has been going back and forth on its stance on the ongoing hostilities between Israeli forces and Hamas, the Palestinian militant outfit in control of Gaza since 2006.\n",

      "Thereafter, a resolution of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the highest decision making body of the party, found no mention of the word ‘Israel’. Instead, it expressed anguish over the war and reiterated the party’s support for the rights of the Palestinian people.This was after a section of leaders raised objections to Ramesh’s statement, stating that it did not reflect the Congress’s historic position on the issue.\n",

      "(Reuters) –     The Palestinian group Hamas launched a surprise attack from Gaza into Israel on Oct. 7, triggering an Israel-Hamas war that marked the most serious escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in many years.\n",
      "WHAT IS HAMAS?\n",
      "Hamas, an acronym of an Arabic phrase meaning Islamic Resistance Movement, was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian Intifada, or uprising. It was created by the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist organisation established in Egypt in the 1920s.\n",
      "It is designated as a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, European Union, Canada, Egypt and Japan.WHAT DOES HAMAS WANT TO ACHIEVE?\n",
      "Hamas wants all the land between the Mediterranean Sea and the River Jordan, which includes the modern state of Israel as well as the occupied West Bank and Gaza. It refuses to recognise Israel, and violently opposed the Oslo peace accords negotiated by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in the mid-1990s.\n",
      "Hamas’s 1988 founding charter called for the destruction of Israel, although Hamas leaders have at times offered a long-term truce, or Hudna in Arabic, with Israel in return for a viable Palestinian state on all Palestinian territory occupied by Israel in the 1967 war. Israel regards this as a ruse.\n",
      "HOW DID HAMAS COME TO POWER?Hamas has run the Gaza Strip since 2007, after a brief civil war with forces loyal to the Fatah movement led by President Mahmoud Abbas, who is based in the West Bank and heads the more secular PLO.\n",
      "The Hamas takeover of Gaza followed its win in Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006 – the last time they were held. Hamas accused Abbas of conspiring against it. Abbas described what happened as a coup.\n",
      "Since then, there have been numerous rounds of conflict with Israel, often involving Hamas rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel and Israeli airstrikes and bombardment of Gaza.\n",
      "WHO ARE THE HAMAS MILITANTS?Hamas has an armed wing called the Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, which has sent gunmen and suicide bombers into Israel and fired thousands of rockets and mortar shells. Hamas characterizes its armed activities as resistance against Israeli occupation.\n",
      "Hamas’s military wing is highly secretive and is run by Mohammed Deif, who masterminded the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. It has bases all over Gaza, but also members across the Israeli-occupied West Bank and farther afield. Many of its leaders and fighters are now thought to be concealed in a huge underground network of tunnels beneath Gaza awaiting Israel’s assault by ground forces.\n",
      "WHO IS FUNDING HAMAS?\n",
      "Although a Sunni Muslim group, Hamas is part of a regional alliance comprising Iran, Syria and the Shi’ite Islamist group Hezbollah in Lebanon, which all broadly oppose U.S. policy in the Middle East and Israel. It has received money, weapons and training from Iran, but also has a fund-raising network around the globe.While its power base is in Gaza, Hamas also has supporters across the Palestinian territories, and it has leaders spread across the Middle East in countries including Qatar.\n",

While elaborating on the ‘root cause’ of the Israel-Palestine conflict, the piece by editor Prafulla Ketkar went on to quote Vivekananda to say that “Jews and Christians are at worst men of little faith ‘for the Islamists’, but the Hindu is idolatrous, the hateful Kaffir.”\n",
      "Presenting the entire conflict merely as one involving a territorial claim, he wrote, is a “grave blunder the ‘secular’ academicians and intellectuals are perpetuating”. He added that the history of Jewish persecution throughout Europe is well-documented, with India being an “honourable exception”.\n",
      "“The monotheistic religions that originated from the Abrahamic tribe, following Jacob, Jesus and then Mohammed, cannot coexist because the supremacist and exclusivist theological interpretation is the root cause of the problem,” read the editorial dated 16 October. \n",
      "Ketkar wrote that “Islamists cannot accept the original territorial claim of Jews, hence the hatred”. He then referred to the normalisation of Israel’s ties with the UAE and to some extent, Saudi Arabia, to say that this “reformist path” is “unacceptable to the Islamists” of which “worldwide protest in the name of Islamic Brotherhood is a reflection”.The editorial also said India’s stand “in favour of Israel” upset some elements within the country and that this must serve as caution as a “group of Islamists, supported by terror-apologist politicians and communist intellectuals, would vitiate the atmosphere in Bharat”. \n",
      "In addition to quoting Vivekananda, Ketkar cited Ambedkar’s “book on Pakistan” to write that, for Islamists, “a country ruled by Kaffir is Dar-ul-Harb (house of war)”.\n",

      "“The attack on the Israelis is not the first attack on humanity; Bharat has experienced multiple such attacks in the past, including the Kashmiri Pandit genocide in 1990, the Moplah massacre in 1921, and many more atrocities. The recent inhuman measures in Afghanistan are obvious indicators to people who have questioned such inhuman actions in the past when digital and social media were not active,” he added.According to him, such “horrible crimes are still carried out by religious extremists, communist pseudo-secularist (sic) gangs, enemies of humanity who pose as guardians of humanity”.\n",

      "“It must be said that the gruesomeness and brutality that was shown to the women and children of Israel was nothing that India had not faced time and again, and most recently in Kashmir. But perhaps an even bigger tragedy was that the way India gradually returned to its normal rhythm after all the storms, was considered as India’s natural weakness. The sad thing is that little to no effort was made to understand this pain of India. Far from apologising for its heinousness and brutality, a class has been seen which boasts of the same till today,” read the editorial dated 15 October.Shankar went on to write that many around the world have expressed their support for Hamas, citing the example of Pakistani cricketer Muhammad Rizwan who in a post on X dedicated his team’s victory over Sri Lanka in the ongoing World Cup to people in Gaza.\n",

India, too, has contributed to this effort.”\n",
      "Emphasising that differences and disputes should be resolved through dialogue, Patel said, “In a world where differences and disputes should be resolved by dialogue, this august body should be deeply concerned at recourse to violence.

Violence as a means to achieve political objectives damages indiscriminately and does not pave the way for any durable solutions.”\n",

      "By Emma Farge and Aidan Lewis(Reuters) –     Distribution of food and medical supplies is faltering in Gaza due to a chronic lack of fuel, looting of stores, the choking of streets with rubble from Israeli shelling and overcrowding caused by displacement of civilians.\n",
      "And despite an uptick in the trickle of supplies, the number of aid trucks entering Gaza — currently averaging 14 daily — remains tiny compared to the 400 trucks seen daily in normal times for a population of 2.3 million now desperate for essentials like bread, aid officials say.\n",
      "U.N. Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) said on Monday that over the past day it had delivered hundreds of tonnes of flour to 50 Gaza bakeries, helping to lower bread prices by half, and to shelters hosting hundreds of thousands of people.\n",
      "But the agency, which runs Gaza’s largest aid operation, said a break-in by hungry Gazans on Sunday at its second largest warehouse was likely to further complicate its work.A logistics base at the Rafah border crossing that is vital to aid distribution has become harder to operate because 8,000 displaced people are sheltering at it.\n",
      "The agency has also seen 67 of its workers killed in Gaza since Oct. 7, the highest number of UN staff killed in any conflict in such a short span of time, it said. \n",
      "UNRWA spokesperson Juliette Touma said the agency’s priority was providing aid to 150 shelters for at least 670,000 displaced people, while another priority was providing wheat flour to bakeries.\n",
      "“We’re way beyond our capacity” to do anything more than that, she added.The number of displaced is four times more than UNRWA had planned for before the war as a worst case scenario, she said.\n",

Medical authorities in Hamas-run Gaza said on Tuesday that 8,525 people including 3,542 minors had been killed.Distribution is particularly hard in northern Gaza, the main focus of Israel’s military operation, aid officials say, and some have halted all deliveries. \n",

      "He said there had been 82 attacks on healthcare facilities in Gaza since the conflict began on Oct. 7, with 491 people killed in the attacks, including 16 on duty health workers, and 28 ambulances damaged or destroyed. Rick Brennan, the WHO regional emergencies director, told Reuters that with 1.4 million people displaced in such a densely populated territory, conditions were dire.\n",
      "“The sanitation is atrocious, I mean I was just talking to an UNRWA colleague, she said the living conditions are sub-human. Where do people go to the bathroom? How do you remove all waste?”\n",

      "In Cairo, U.S. Special Envoy David Satterfield, who has been negotiating with Israel and Egypt over aid deliveries, said providing humanitarian aid was critically important for Gaza, whose inhabitants say food and water have almost run out.“This is a society on edge and desperate… and the U.N. implementers must be able to demonstrate that aid is not episodic,” he said in a briefing for reporters.\n",
      "Aid flows from Egypt have been slowed by an inspection system agreed with Israel in which trucks drive from Egypt’s Rafah crossing along the Egypt-Israel border before returning towards Gaza. UNRWA’s Touma called the system “way too cumbersome”.\n",

      " The United Nations Secretary-General also spoke on the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, acknowledging that despite being thousands of miles away, Nepali citizens were among the victims of Hamas’ brutal attacks in Israel.\n",
      " He extended his condolences to the families of the 10 Nepalese students who lost their lives during an attack by Hamas militants in Israel and expressed his best wishes for the safe return of Bipin Joshi, a student who is currently missing. “As geopolitical tensions rise, global divisions are becoming deeper and more dangerous. Smaller countries fear becoming collateral damage in competition between great powers,” Guterres said.\n",
      " Lauding Nepal’s peace process, the General Secretary said, “Your country has successfully calmed the storms of conflict and moved from war to peace. A process the United Nations has been proud to support”.\n",
      " “This small country has made an outsized contribution to international peace…you are preparing the final stages of your peace process – healing the wounds of war through transitional justice. A process that must help to bring peace to victims, families and communities haunted by questions, and scarred by injustice; and help put the past to rest,” he noted.\n",
      " The UN chief underscored the need to implement the transitional justice mechanism saying, “Transitional justice can play a vital role in securing lasting peace.” Over 17,000 people were killed and thousands were displaced, mostly throughout rural Nepal, during the armed Maoist movement in Nepal that lasted from 1996 to 2006. The conflict began on February 1996, when the CPN (Maoist) initiated an insurgency to overthrow the Nepali monarchy and establish a people’s republic. The revolution ended with the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Accord on November 2006.\n",
      " Emphasising Nepal’s commitment to global peace and security, Guterres pointed out that the Himalayan nation is the second-largest contributor of troops to United Nations missions worldwide.\n",
      " India has been the largest troop contributor to UN missions since its inception.\n",
      " Nepal, the UN chief said, “is a promoter of peace, a champion of multilateralism, and a staunch supporter of sustainable development and climate action”. Underlining the disastrous impact of global warming, Guterres said, “Glaciers are melting at records…The effect is devastating. Swollen lakes bursting, rivers and seas rising, cultures threatened. And mountain sides exposed, inflaming the risk of rock slides, landslides and avalanche.” He said the world must act now to protect people on the frontline and to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The UN chief also appealed to the international community to donate funding to help build resilience in effected communities.\n",
      " As climate catastrophe is accelerating with a deadly force, the world could learn much from Nepal in responding to these crises, Guterres said.\n",
      " He also recognised Nepal’s unique position, nestled between two major powers (India and China), and commended the nation for forging its own path to safeguard sovereignty and independence.\n",
      " Guterres also underscored the need for reform in the United Nations, including the Security Council. “Developing countries must have far greater representation in international institutions,” he said, adding, “I have called for reform of the outdated United Nations Security Council.” Guterres said he “has proposed measures to reform the global financial architecture – so that it better represents developing countries and responds to their needs”.\n",

      "New Delhi: Although Israel’s bombardment of Gaza and the rising Palestinian toll continued to weigh heavily on the minds of the Urdu press this week, next month’s assembly elections in five states also got significant space on its front pages and editorials. \n",
      "As elections in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram, and Telangana draw near, all three prominent Urdu papers, Roznama Rashtriya Sahara, Inquilab, and Siasat, carried extensive coverage of campaigns by both the BJP and the Opposition INDIA alliance. \n",
      "An editorial in Inquilab offered a rare criticism of the Opposition bloc, especially in light of the fissures between the Congress and the Samajwadi Party (SP) over ticket distribution in Madhya Pradesh. Titled ‘Is INDIA still on hold?’, the editorial dated 27 October sought to warn the Opposition alliance that it was not as strong as it ought to be to counter the BJP during next year’s parliamentary election. \n",
      "“Its meetings are not taking place. Are all its activities secret and (if so), will they come to light after the assembly elections of five states?” the editorial asked. “Tensions have been rising (in the alliance) since its joint sessions in Patna, Bengaluru, and Mumbai. A day will come soon when even the name INDIA will disappear from the minds of the people of the country.”Other issues that received prominent coverage in the Urdu press are the debate on a nationwide caste census and former Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s return to the country. \n",
      "The newspapers also reported Qatar’s death sentence to eight former Indian Navy officers in a case of alleged espionage.\n",
      "Here’s a recap of all that made the front pages and editorials of the Urdu press this week. \n",
      "Also Read: Urdu press hails SC ruling on same-sex marriage, says ‘unnatural practice’ needs ‘cure’In its editorial on 22 October, Siasat called the BJP’s decision to finally give A ticket to former Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje an “attempt to end internal disturbances” and maintain balance within the party. The BJP, according to this editorial, has suffered several losses at a public level and this is an attempt to recoup. \n",
      "Another editorial in the newspaper, dated 24 October, said the BJP’s “frustration” is causing it to create differences in the Opposition’s 26-party INDIA alliance through the “Godi media”, and praised the Congress for focusing on its election campaign “instead of paying attention to such side issues”.\n",
      "“Godi media” is a derogatory term that critics of the Modi government use for media organisations they perceive as being partial to the ruling dispensation. \n",
      "The editorial also referred to the differences between the Congress and the SP over ticket distribution — according to it, there may be “differences of opinion” between the parties, but this does not throw the alliance into a state of disarray.On 25 October, Siasat’s editorial spoke about wasteful election expenditure and the use of illegally acquired money during elections. What is even more concerning, according to the article, is the public’s willingness to go along with the trend and vote for the candidate who pays more.  \n",
      "Even public-spirited individuals are not untouched by this, the editorial said, adding that whether political leaders, candidates, or the voting public, it’s everyone’s responsibility not to weaken the roots of India’s democracy.\n",
      "In its editorial on 25 October, Inquilab wrote about the “infighting” in the BJP’s Rajasthan unit. Until a few months ago, the party would not tire of speaking about the battle within the Congress between Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and his once deputy, Sachin Pilot, the editorial said. But now, it’s facing the same situation, it added — the party had first announced that it would not give tickets to former contenders, but now, more than 70 percent of its candidates in the state are elderly. \n",
      "The editorial also puts down the BJP’s decision to give a ticket to the long-sidelined Raje to its “weak position” in the state. The party, according to the editorial, knows that Madhya Pradesh could slip through its fingers and is now pinning its hopes on Rajasthan. On 26 October, Siasat’s editorial took stock of election predictions. It cited election surveys to say that the BJP could face a crushing defeat in Madhya Pradesh and is making all kinds of efforts to retain power in the state while also unseating the Ashok Gehlot-led government in Rajasthan. But so far, its efforts have had little success, it added. \n",
      "Amid apprehensions about an imminent Israeli ground invasion in Gaza and the death toll mounting in the Palestinian territories, the Urdu press continued to focus on the ongoing conflict not only in its front pages but also in its editorials.  \n",
      "Editorials in the three prominent Urdu newspapers questioned the “world’s silence” over the rising death toll in the impoverished Gaza. \n",
      "The Gaza strip has been under siege since 7 October, when Hamas — the militant organistion that has controlled it since 2007 — attacked Israel. The death toll in Israel’s retaliatory assault reportedly stands at over 7,000.  Sahara’s editorial on 23 October questioned the West for its silence over the mounting humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The West’s support has emboldened Israel, it said, adding that, despite the loss of lives and property, no Western country is ready to come forward to demand a ceasefire. \n",
      "“How can one expect improvement under such circumstances?” the editorial asks. \n",
      "In another editorial on 24 October, Sahara analysed the US’ position in the Israel-Hamas conflict. America, according to the editorial, was behaving like Hamas had attacked it and not Israel. The war has also exposed the US’ weakening position in world politics, it said, adding that it could neither hold out in Afghanistan (before the Taliban seized control of the country in 2021) nor directly confront Moscow in the Ukraine war.\n",
      "It added that if Israel were to launch a ground invasion in Gaza and lose its soldiers in large numbers, the US may have to get directly involved, giving countries like China and Russia a chance to take “advantage” of the situation.In an editorial dated 26 October, Inquilab said that, in an ideal world, where there’s no hypocrisy, Israel would be tried and punished for war crimes. But Tel Aviv continues to break international humanitarian laws even as major world powers watch silently, it added. \n",

      "Former Pakistan PM Sharif returned to the country last week after four years. \n",
      "In an editorial on 23 October, Siasat said Sharif has made it clear that his daughter Maryam Nawaz Sharif would be his successor. Pakistan, the editorial said, needs strong leadership, especially given its economic situation. It also needs to mend its ties with its neighbours — most notably India, it added. According to the editorial, Pakistan’s “political and military conflicts” have eroded its position, and without loans, it would be hard for the country to survive.  \n",
      "“Nawaz Sharif, his family, and other political leaders must think carefully in such a situation,” the editorial said. “We (India and Pakistan) must set aside political differences and work together to create a comprehensive plan.” \n",
      "In an editorial on 25 October, Sahara referred to the support for a caste-based census within the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance. \n",
      "Smaller parties like the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party, the NISHAD party, Apna Dal (Sonelal), and Hindustani Awam Morcha Secular have all voiced their support for a caste-based survey, although ally BJP is still reluctant. According to the editorial, NDA constituents’ support for such a survey may worry the BJP, which has been surprisingly mute on the issue despite PM Narendra Modi’s wooing of Pasmanda Muslims. \n",
      "“All these things suggest Mandal-like conditions for the country again. This is just the beginning, but statements suggest it will go far,” it said. “This will become a compulsion for all parties. No one can neglect the OBCs.”\n",

      "If we asked a question like “how important are the armies to building and projecting a nation’s power”, we would be laughed out as idiots. We have no intention of going there.\n",
      "That the military is central to a nation’s Gross National Power (GNP) is beyond any doubt. Unless, of course, you are still an idealistic and uncorrupted teenager at your school’s Model UN debate.\n",
      "That’s why defence budgets are going up for all major nations. Even Japan has dumped its pacifism and released a comprehensive military upgrade plan to double its defence budget by 2027.\n",
      "If we, however, posit this question differently, a debate is possible. Critical and essential though the armies are for overall power, can they achieve their nation’s political objectives by themselves? Our answer won’t be an unequivocal yes. But that would be the impression if you watch much of the debate in the country, especially on our TV channels that seem to be raring for the invasion.The logic is, Israel has among the world’s best armies, intelligence, and once these are unleashed, Hamas will be history. Here’s a spoiler: if military power is all it would take to finish the menace of an awful terrorist organisation like Hamas, how come five Israeli wars in Gaza since 2003 have failed to do so? And where did ISIS come from?\n",
      "If quick military invasion is all that was needed to finish Hamas, how come the Israelis still haven’t done so? Are they hedging, hesitant or regrouping after the first flush of anger has passed?\n",
      "Israel’s own experience shows better than any other nation, besides the US’s, that relying on military power, however overwhelming, is a very dodgy approach to a larger political and strategic objective. It mostly guarantees failure, not success.\n",
      "Specifically for Israel, its armies have played a critical role in protecting it. But it had to make an expensive peace deal with the Egyptians returning all territories captured in 1967. All its other enemies, including non-state actors such as Hamas or Hezbollah, are still in the ring for a fight, and on their feet.History of the past eight decades (post-World War-2) teaches us that a pure military approach is almost always guaranteed to fail. There might be a couple of exceptions here and there, like India in 1971 and Britain in the Falklands War, but those are also qualified by other important factors.\n",
      "On the record though, Israeli leaders, especially Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have spoken repeatedly of destroying Hamas with a finality. For that to happen, it is presumed — and widely accepted — that a ground invasion is absolutely necessary. Since the atrocity of 7 October, the only question over the ground invasion has been when. The why, how, and to what end, have mostly been missing from the debate.\n",
      "Of course, there are two clear sides to the larger question for the Israelis/Jews and for Hamas/Palestinians. A ground invasion is taken as an inevitability by both, never mind the caution that US President Joe Biden sounded on his way out of Israel. Those who believe that Netanyahu is absolutely committed to the idea think that he is only waiting for the new equipment from the US to be in place, and its western allies to build up strength in the Mediterranean to deter Iran and its proxies.\n",
      "Either way, since he has some breathing and thinking room now, a bit of rethink might not be out of place. It is possible that the conclusion will still finally be to “go inside”, but there is no harm doing a bit more wargaming and also history-gazing.Because, while almost nobody since 1945 achieved its primary national objective through military means, many have ended up suffering unlikely defeats and enfeebling themselves in the course of time. Think Soviet Union in Afghanistan, America in Afghanistan and Iraq. And before that, Vietnam and Korea. Similarly, the French military power lost all of Africa. Now, we watch a retreat of the remains of French power from several countries in Africa as the new juntas backed by the Chinese and Russian proxies take over. Niger being only the more prominent example.\n",

Check out how history was made when the Saudis used top-of-the-line US supplied anti-missile systems to shoot down a Houthi missile en route to Israel.Saudis will be new and good friends because they see their strategic interests always run contrary to Iran’s and aligned with the US and Israel.

      "In a war, one side may win every battle, as the Americans did in Afghanistan and Iran. But in the absence of diplomacy, politics, compromise and give-and-take going hand-in-hand, the final result is defeat.\n",
      "Israel’s challenge is complicated by the fact that they do not face a hostile, sovereign power. Whatever the Iranians may do behind the scenes, they are not about to participate directly in this war. Gaza itself is really a little urban sprawl. Think of it as a territory the size of Greater Noida on the outskirts of Delhi. Or about one-and-a-half times the size of Noida. It is merely 351 square km, 41 km long and between 5 and 12 km wide. You can unleash the strongest military in the middle-east and declare victory. But there will be costs.\n",
      "As any practitioner of urban warfare will tell you — what modern armies call FIBUA, or Fighting In Built-Up Areas — cities suck in and trap troops and give a determined defender as much advantage as high ground in the mountains. Does Israel want to risk that, along with civilian casualties, destruction and global censure? It may kill all of Hamas’s current leaders and most of its manpower, but the supremely evil idea and ideology won’t just survive, it will return stronger.Would it be better off fighting a more patient, Israel-like long war, using its legendary intelligence, targeted attacks, targeting terrorist leaders and avoiding its own casualties as well as international opprobrium? This delayed ground invasion is Netanyahu’s moment to rethink.\n",

      "The demonstrations that sprang up in the United Kingdom after the Hamas attack on Israel shows that the response to jihadism has shifted. The last three weeks have seen the open proclamation of Islamic jihad on the UK’s streets and the intimidation of its Jewish population.\n",
      "This has confirmed the comfort that sections of the political Left in the UK draw from the revolutionary potential they detect in Islamic fundamentalism. It is no longer unequivocally seen as a criminal movement but one through which ‘resistance’ is being carried out. This description is seductive not only to Muslims but also to sections of the Left and supported by superficially attractive claims of decolonisation.\n",
      "On issues such as LGBTQ+ rights, Islamic jihadism and Leftist movements are diametrically opposed, but their soldering has occurred at the focal point of the Palestine question. Together, they have taken the genie of jihad out of the bottle. The menace of Islamic fundamentalism and the criminality it espouses have not gone unnoticed since the burnings of Salman Rushdie’s Satanic Verses in the late 1980s. Iran had called for the author’s execution. Even if the extent is difficult to verify, Iran today provides support and succour to Hamas. Although now a mere footnote in history, the Iranian revolution violently eliminated the Left in that country.\n",
      "Also Read: Student protests over Israel-Palestine in Western colleges is seeing a corrosion of correctnessIt is just over a year since Hindus in Leicester and Birmingham saw up close that jihadis can operate almost without restriction with what appeared to be the collusion of the local police authority and municipality. With a large spike in reports of antisemitic crimes, British Jews are now considering their options. It is curious that the spike in reports of Islamophobic attacks doesn’t lead to Muslims making emigration plans. It is instead accompanied by calls to jihad from mosque pulpits across the United Kingdom, reported The Jewish Chronicle.\n",
      "If the number of jihadis on the British Security Service watchlist, as per a Daily Mail report, was not already indicative of the jihadist problem, the scale of it has been shown in the demonstrations since the 7 October Hamas attacks. Groups of protestors have openly waved jihadist flags and shouted for the massacre of Jews. Although MI5’s director general confirms that the current national threat level remains substantial, London’s police stood by. Adding insult, the police initially announced through their social media accounts that the flags and chants of jihad were not criminal. If one treats the police claim generously one might be forgiven for concluding that the police too think that calling for jihad by Muslim armies is a legitimate expression of Islamic beliefs. The Islamic movements that now inhabit Britain’s mainstream certainly believe that.\n",
      "A 2018 report by the All Party Parliamentary Group on British Muslims indicates how institutionalised the rot has become. It cites as an example of Islamophobia, “Denying Muslim populations the right to self-determination e.g., by claiming that the existence of an independent Palestine or Kashmir is a terrorist endeavour.” How then could Hamas possibly be a terrorist organisation? The report’s definition of Islamophobia has since been adopted by many local authorities.\n",
      "Also Read: What, when, where, why & how of the Israel-Hamas warAs with Leicester last year and London this year, we might be forgiven for hypothesising that these movements have penetrated police forces. Similar police indulgence of Muslim attacks in London, accompanied by the waving of Pakistani and Turkish flags, has been shown during the several occasions when the Indian High Commission has been attacked. While successive Home Secretaries—then Priti Patel and now Suella Braverman—might outrage about such police indifference, operational matters lie with London’s mayor Sadiq Khan, who has been in office throughout these events. In a seeming attempt to secure his return after the next mayoral election, Khan’s call for a ceasefire is an effective demand that the Israelis stop their pursuit of Hamas. He is not alone, with over 300 Muslim Labour councillors signalling in a letter that the party adopt the same approach. Some have resigned from the party. Couched in the form of a plea from a ‘community’ they ostensibly represent, one cannot help thinking that this is international Islamism at play.\n",
      "Much of the culturally emasculated political Right points to the failure of multiculturalism as the explanation for both Leicester and the events in October 2023. If multiculturalism entails a broad policy of tolerance of different cultures and creeds, Britain and its diverse society have largely lived up to the ideal. It is Muslims who have outstandingly failed to do so. It is a pointless expectation for all immigrants to live up to the ideals of liberalism of which the political Right has now become the defender. However, at least the varied segments of British society have not undermined the fabric of liberalism by open hostility to it. Again, it is the Muslim exception that stands out as the most vociferously hostile to liberalism. It is unfortunate that Braverman did not make this clear when she went on to blame recent immigrants, which can be read as referring to Hindus, for last year’s events in Leicester. If immigration has been instrumental in helping undermine multiculturalism, it isn’t all immigration but the specific sort from which the now mainstreamed Islamic fundamentalist movements derive support and following. Neither their advocacy of the submission of non-Muslims to Muslim dominance nor any other aspect of Islamification has any cognitive appeal, and it is thus expectedly imposed through violence.\n",
      "Some of the causes are to be found in Mark Curtis’s Secret Affairs: Britain’s Collusion with Radical Islam, where the author vividly describes the extent of the United Kingdom’s encouragement of Islamic fundamentalist movements. The chickens have now come home to roost, but you do not find those chiming into the chorus of international Islamism complaining or resigning on those grounds. Years of intelligence gathering and academic research, hugely costly anti-radicalisation policies, and several laws on terrorism have strangely not controlled the problem. Largely dominant in all cultural institutions such as the media and universities, the collusive and deliberate blindness of the Left has been noted already. Besides, this is not the old Left, but a new social justice Left that turns blindness into an article of faith, debilitating Britain’s ability to respond to jihadism.\n",
      "This leaves Britain with no clear way out and a bleak future. The obvious targets of jihadist violence, prominently among which are Jews and Hindus, will have to be ever more afraid about the safety and security, which they have largely been able to take for granted until recently.The writer is a reader in Culture and Law at Queen Mary, University of London.

      "India’s abstention at the UN General Assembly on the Jordanian-sponsored resolution over the weekend, seeking a humanitarian pause in the Israeli bombardment of Gaza, continues to reverberate. The country seems largely divided between the realist school – which believes that might is right, a view led by the US-Israel alliance – and those who pursue the moral high ground, which remains aghast at the unprecedented number of deaths in the conflict so far.\n",
      "On the face of it, the Modi government seems to have taken the safe way out by abstaining and not voting against the resolution. Just like the US and Israel did, despite the fact that PM Modi had tweeted his and India’s “solidarity with Israel” within hours of the 7 October massacre.\n",
      "But the truth is that in the UN system, abstentions don’t count. So the resolution, even if it was a non-binding one, which means that no country would be forced to follow through, and which passed with a two-thirds majority, is really a toothless one. Even if as many as 120 countries voted in favour, 14 against, and 45 abstained.\n",
      "India, as is known by now, was the only country in South Asia that abstained. Bangladesh, the Maldives, and Pakistan co-sponsored the resolution. Even Bhutan, considered to be India’s closest friend, voted in favour.France broke from its Western allies by voting in favour of the UN resolution. China and Russia, expectedly, did likewise. The UK, America’s closest ally, abstained – as did Germany and Japan.\n",
      "The US was the only permanent member of the Security Council that voted alongside Israel. Look who else voted in favour: Nauru, Fiji, Guatemala, Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Croatia, Czechia, Austria, Papua New Guinea, Tonga, Paraguay, Hungary and Israel.\n",
      "Clearly, the US is so aware of its own power that it cares little for global opinion.\n",
      "It’s also really interesting that the Democratic Party, led by US President Joe Biden, seems okay with watching the slaughter of innocent people in Gaza; there isn’t much that differentiates them from the Republicans. What a far cry from the tears it has shed in the past over human rights violations across the world, including in Jammu and Kashmir. Clearly, the power of the US-Jewish lobby that controls the levers of politics and finance is in full play.Also read: India’s support for Israel is the right choice. But taking a middle path would be wiser\n",
      "To reiterate, this was not a binding UN resolution, so no party will be censured. The realist school also believes the UN is a paper tiger, so who cares even if most of the world voted in favour of the humanitarian pause for Palestine?\n",
      "Moreover, this lot believes that India’s abstention was the right thing to do, not just because it was in line with its several abstentions on the Russian invasion of Ukraine last year, but because the resolution didn’t name Hamas as the perpetrator of the 7 October violence. As the Indian deputy permanent representative at the UN pointed out in her explanation of the vote, India remains anguished about the continuing loss of life, but couldn’t possibly vote in favour of a pause because it didn’t go far enough in condemning the “malignancy” of “terrorism.”\n",
      "Talk about twisting your foreign policy through hoops. Moreover, the realist school misses the larger point, which is that this is a moment in history when it is important to stand up and be counted on pushing for the end of war. Like most of the world has done.Certainly, the Modi government has shifted much closer to Israel in the last five years. In 2018, India voted along with 120 countries in the UN deploring Israel for using “excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate force” against Palestinians. It condemned the “use of live ammunition against civilian protestors, including children…”\n",
      "So, what has changed in the last five years? Why is the Modi government much more willing to be seen today as standing in favour of Israel than it was earlier, and as a result, willing to stomach the death of more than 8,000 Palestinians so far? Clearly, the “abstention” in 2023 is a change from “voting along the resolution” in 2018.\n",
      "Certainly, the Modi government made a considered decision when it “abstained”, but refused to vote “along with” Israel and the US this weekend. Despite his “solidarity” tweet for Israel within hours of the 7 October Hamas attack, the PM understands that Tel Aviv’s horrifyingly disproportionate response isn’t going down well with folks at home – not just the Congress party.\n",
      "That is why Modi, one day after the vote, called the Egyptian president Abdel Fatah El-Sisi, whose response to the crisis will be instrumental in how things evolve.India also understands well the hypocrisy of the Arab world. If they were so concerned about the fate of the Palestinians, they would have surely done something — they had 75 years to fix the problem. Just in the last couple of years, the UAE has kissed and made up with Israel, and the Saudis were also about to do so.\n",
      "Moreover, the Gulf monarchies have such total control over their restive streets that there is no danger of them rising up against the wishes of their respective sheikhs – no wonder the Americans have used these sheikhs to create alphabets soup that most recently spell I2U2 (India-Israel-US-UAE) or IMEEC (India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor).\n",
      "Much more worrying is the unhappiness of people in Middle Eastern nations like Egypt, Tunisia, Jordan, and Lebanon against their autocratic rulers. Never forget it was a vegetable seller in Tunisia who lit the spark that snowballed into the Arab Spring more than a decade ago. Of course, these Arab elites have, over the decades, cruelly and successfully put down those democratic protests and demonstrations, citing the fear of Right-wing Islamist radical organisations like the Muslim Brotherhood, thus keeping themselves in power.\n",
      "Still, the burgeoning death toll in Palestine these past few days is moving the stoniest of hearts. Israel has gone ahead with its invasion of Gaza, but it’s not clear how this will unfold – remember that Hamas still holds Israeli hostages as crucial leverage.It now seems the UAE is contemplating another resolution at the UN, this time a binding one. No matter. The realist school is right to the extent that few care about these speeches from the podium of a fancy UN auditorium. But when horrifying images of dying and dead men, women, and children fill your screens night after night after night across the world – something will have to give, something should give.\n",
      "The realist school is probably right. Tomorrow’s another day. With another resolution at the UN and an emergency meeting of Arab states next week, little is likely to change.\n",

      "The 193-member General Assembly adopted the resolution that called for an immediate, durable and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities.\n",
      "The resolution, which garnered 121 votes in favour, 44 abstentions and 14 member states voting against it, also demanded the immediate, continuous, sufficient and unhindered provision of essential goods and services to civilians throughout the Gaza Strip.India’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Yojna Patel, in Explanation of Vote here said in a world where differences and disputes should be resolved by dialogue, this august body should be deeply concerned at recourse to violence.\n",
      "“That too, when it happens on a scale and intensity that is an affront to basic human values,” Patel said.\n",
      "Patel said that violence as a means to achieve political objectives damages indiscriminately and does not pave the way for any durable solutions.\n",
      "Describing the terror attacks in Israel on October 7 as shocking, Patel said they deserve condemnation. India’s explanation of the vote did not mention Hamas.“Terrorism is a malignancy and knows no borders, nationality or race. The world should not buy into any justification of terror acts. Let us keep aside differences, unite and adopt a zero-tolerance approach to terrorism,” she said.\n",
      "India expressed hope that the deliberations of the General Assembly will “send a clear message against terror and violence and expand prospects for diplomacy and dialogue while addressing the humanitarian crisis that confronts us.” Patel said India is “deeply concerned” at the deteriorating security situation and astounding loss of civilian lives in the ongoing conflict.\n",
      "“The escalation of hostilities in the region will only exacerbate the humanitarian crisis. It is necessary for all parties to display the utmost responsibility,” she said. India also called for the “immediate and unconditional release” of the hostages.\n",
      "Earlier, Iraq had abstained on the resolution but later changed its vote to a yes citing “a technical problem” at the time of voting. Countries voting against the resolution included Israel and the US. China, France, and Russia voted in favour of the resolution while Canada, Germany, Japan, Ukraine and the UK abstained.The resolution called for immediate, full, sustained, safe and unhindered humanitarian access for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and other United Nations humanitarian agencies and their implementing partners, the International Committee of the Red Cross and all other humanitarian organisations upholding humanitarian principles and delivering urgent assistance to civilians in the Gaza Strip.\n",
      "It encourages the establishment of humanitarian corridors and other initiatives to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to civilians and welcomes efforts on this.\n",
      "Patel stressed that casualties in the ongoing conflict in Gaza are a telling, serious and continuing concern and it is civilians, especially women and children, who are paying with their lives.\n",
      "“This humanitarian crisis needs to be addressed,” Patel said, welcoming the international community’s de-escalation efforts and delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza.She noted that India too has contributed to this effort. India has sent 38 tons of humanitarian goods, including medicines and equipment to the people of Palestine.\n",
      "Patel reiterated that India has always supported a negotiated two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine issue, leading to the establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable state of Palestine, living within secure and recognised borders, side by side in peace with Israel.\n",
      "“For this, we urge the parties to de-escalate, eschew violence and work towards creating conditions for an early resumption of direct peace negotiations,” she said.\n",
      "The Jordanian-drafted resolution did not make any mention of the militant group Hamas.Before the General Assembly voted on the resolution, the 193-member body considered an amendment proposed by Canada and co-sponsored by the US to the text.\n",
      "The amendment proposed by Canada asked for inserting a paragraph in the resolution that would state that the General Assembly “Unequivocally rejects and condemns the terrorist attacks by Hamas that took place in Israel starting on 7 October 2023 and the taking of hostages, demands the safety, well-being and humane treatment of the hostages in compliance with international law, and calls for their immediate and unconditional release.” India voted in favour of the amendment, along with 87 other nations, while 55 member states voted against and 23 abstentions.\n",
      "The draft amendment could not be adopted, having failed to obtain a 2/3rd majority of members present and voting.\n",
      "The adopted resolution called for the rescinding of the order by “Israel, the occupying Power”, for Palestinian civilians and United Nations staff, as well as humanitarian and medical workers, to evacuate all areas in the Gaza Strip north of the Wadi Gaza and relocate to southern Gaza.It also called for the immediate and unconditional release of all civilians who are being illegally held captive, demanding their safety, well-being and humane treatment in compliance with international law.\n",
      "It emphasised the importance of preventing further destabilisation and escalation of violence in the region and in this regard called upon all parties to exercise maximum restraint and upon all those with influence on them to work toward this objective.\n",
      "Meanwhile, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres voiced deep concern at the humanitarian system in Gaza, saying it is facing a total collapse with unimaginable consequences for more than 2 million civilians.\n",
      "Guterres noted that about 500 trucks per day were crossing into Gaza before the hostilities began but in recent days, an average of only 12 trucks per day have entered, despite needs being far greater than at any time before. Further, the supplies that have trickled in do not include fuel for United Nations operations.“Given the desperate and dramatic situation, the United Nations will not be able to continue to deliver inside Gaza without an immediate and fundamental shift in how aid is going in,” Guterres said.\n",
      "He added that the verification system for the movement of goods through the Rafah crossing must be adjusted to allow many more trucks to enter Gaza without delay.\n",
      "Guterres underscored that life-saving humanitarian aid – food, water, medicine, fuel – must be allowed to reach all civilians swiftly, safely and at scale.\n",
      "“Misery is growing by the minute. Without a fundamental change, the people of Gaza will face an unprecedented avalanche of human suffering,” the UN chief said.\n",
      "(Reuters) –     The war between Israel and Hamas, which stormed Israeli towns and kibbutzes bordering Gaza in a shock attack on Oct. 7, is the latest in seven decades of conflict between Israelis and Palestinians that has destabilised the wider Middle East.\n",
      "In Hamas’ rampage, some 1,400 Israelis, mainly civilians, were killed and 229 taken hostage. In response, Israel hammered Gaza with air strikes before troops and tanks poured into the small coastal enclave in a ground assault expected to meet fierce resistance from Hamas and other Islamist militants. Medical authorities in Hamas-run Gaza said on Monday that 8,306 people – including 3,457 minors – had been killed in the enclave.\n",
      "WHAT ARE THE ORIGINS OF THE CONFLICT?\n",
      "The intractable conflict pits Israeli demands for security in what it has long regarded as a hostile Middle East against Palestinian aspirations for a state of their own.Israel’s founding father David Ben-Gurion proclaimed the modern State of Israel on May 14, 1948, establishing a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution and seeking a national home on land to which they cite deep ties dating to antiquity.\n",
      "Palestinians lament Israel’s creation as the Nakba, or catastrophe, that resulted in their mass dispossession and blocked their own dreams of statehood.\n",
      "In the war that followed, some 700,000 Palestinians, half the Arab population of what was British-ruled Palestine, fled or were driven from their homes, ending up in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria as well as in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem.\n",
      "Israel, a close U.S. ally, contests the assertion that it drove Palestinians from their homes and points out it was attacked by five Arab states the day after its creation. Armistice agreements halted the fighting in 1949 but there was no formal peace.Palestinians who stayed put in the war, and their descendants, today make up about 20% of Israel’s population.\n",
      "WHAT MAJOR WARS HAVE BEEN FOUGHT SINCE THEN?\n",
      "In 1967, Israel made a pre-emptive strike against Egypt and Syria, launching the Six-Day War. Israel captured the West Bank and Arab East Jerusalem from Jordan and the Golan Heights from Syria and occupied them ever since.\n",
      "In 1973, Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack on Israeli positions along the Suez Canal and Golan Heights, touching off the Yom Kippur War. Israel pushed both armies back within three weeks.Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 and thousands of Palestinian fighters under Yasser Arafat were evacuated by sea after a 10-week siege. In 2006, Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah militants captured two Israeli soldiers in the volatile border region and Israel launched military action, triggering a six-week war.\n",
      "In 2005 Israel unilaterally withdrew settlers and soldiers from Gaza, which it had captured from Egypt in 1967. But Gaza saw major flare-ups of fighting in 2006, 2008, 2012, 2014 and 2021 that involved Israeli air raids and Palestinian rocket fire, and sometimes also cross-border incursions by either side.\n",
      "As well as wars, there have been two Palestinian intifadas (uprisings), in 1987-93 and again in 2000-05. The second saw waves of Hamas suicide bombings against Israelis, and Israeli tank and air strikes on Palestinian cities.\n",
      "WHAT ATTEMPTS HAVE THERE BEEN TO MAKE PEACE?In 1979, Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty, ending 30 years of hostility. In 1993, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organization leader, shook hands on the Oslo Accords on limited Palestinian autonomy. In 1994, Israel signed a peace treaty with Jordan.\n",
      "President Bill Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Arafat took part in the Camp David summit in 2000, but failed to reach a final peace deal.\n",
      "In 2002, an Arab League plan offered Israel normal relations with all Arab countries in return for a full withdrawal from the lands it took in the 1967 Middle East war, the creation of a Palestinian state and a “just solution” for Palestinian refugees. The presentation of the plan was overshadowed by Hamas, which blew up an Israeli hotel full of Holocaust survivors during their Passover seder.\n",
      "Further peace efforts have been stalled since 2014, when talks failed between Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.Palestinians boycotted dealings with the 2017-21 administration of U.S. President Donald Trump since it reversed decades of U.S. policy by refusing to endorse the two-state solution – the peace formula that envisages a Palestinian state established in territory that Israel captured in 1967.\n",
      "WHERE DO PEACE EFFORTS STAND NOW?\n",
      "The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has focused on trying to secure a “grand bargain” in the Middle East that includes normalisation of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, custodian of Islam’s two holiest shrines.\n",
      "The latest war is diplomatically awkward for Riyadh as well as for other Arab states, including some Gulf Arab states next to Saudi Arabia, that have signed peace deals with Israel.WHAT ARE THE MAIN ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN ISSUES?\n",
      "A two-state solution, Israeli settlements on occupied land, the status of Jerusalem, agreed borders, and the fate of Palestinian refugees are at the core of the dispute.\n",
      "Two-state solution: An agreement that would create a state for the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip alongside Israel. Hamas rejects the two-state solution and is sworn to Israel’s destruction. Israel has said a Palestinian state must be demilitarized so as not to threaten its security.\n",
      "Settlements: Most countries deem Jewish settlements built on land Israel occupied in 1967 as illegal. Israel disputes this and cites historical and Biblical ties to the land. Continued settlement expansion is among the most contentious issues between Israel, the Palestinians and international community.Jerusalem: Palestinians want East Jerusalem, which includes the walled Old City’s sites sacred to Muslims, Jews and Christians alike, to be the capital of their state. Israel says Jerusalem should remain its “indivisible and eternal” capital.\n",
      "Israel’s claim to Jerusalem’s eastern part is not recognised internationally. Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, without specifying the extent of its jurisdiction in the disputed city, and moved the U.S. embassy there in 2018.\n",
      "Refugees: Today about 5.6 million Palestinian refugees – mainly descendants of those who fled in 1948 – live in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza. About half of registered refugees remain stateless, according to the Palestinian foreign ministry, many living in crowded camps.\n",
      "Palestinians have long demanded that refugees should be allowed to return, along with millions of their descendants. Israel says any resettlement of Palestinian refugees must occur outside of its borders. (Compiled by Reuters journalists; editing by Edmund Blair, Stephen Farrell and Mark Heinrich)\n",

      "Gaza/Jerusalem: Israel said its forces fought Hamas gunmen inside the militants’ vast tunnel network beneath Gaza as a hospital director said more than 50 Palestinians were killed in an Israeli air strike on a refugee camp in the besieged enclave.\n",
      "As the battle inside the tiny Hamas-ruled Palestinian territory intensified, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed international calls for a halt to the fighting.\n",
      "But U.N. and other aid officials warned that a public health catastrophe was engulfing civilians in Gaza, with hospitals struggling to cope with mounting casualties and food, medicine, drinking water and fuel running short.\n",
      "The director of Gaza’s Indonesian Hospital told Al Jazeera that more than 50 Palestinians were killed and 150 wounded in Israeli air strikes on a densely populated area of the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.\n",
      "The tunnels under the cramped enclave are a prime objective for Israel as it expands a four-day-old ground offensive – after three weeks of aerial bombardment – into Gaza from the north to hit Hamas in retaliation for the Islamist group’s deadly surprise attack into southern Israel on Oct. 7.\n",
      "Some of the 240 hostages that Israel says were seized by Hamas that day are believed to be held in the tunnel complex, adding a further complication for the Israelis on top of the difficulties of fighting in an urban setting.\n",
      "“Over the last day, combined IDF (Israel Defence Forces) struck approximately 300 targets, including anti-tank missile and rocket launch posts below shafts, as well as military compounds inside underground tunnels belonging to the Hamas terrorist organization,” an Israeli military statement said.Militants responded with anti-tank missiles and machine gun fire, it said. A number of militants were killed, it said, without specifying a number.\n",
      "Hamas said in a statement its fighters were engaging in fierce battles with Israeli ground forces, who were taking losses. “The occupation is pushing its soldiers into proud Gaza, which will always be the cemetery of invaders,” Hamas said.\n",
      "Israeli forces also bombed the narrow coastal enclave overnight in air, sea and ground attacks, hitting northwestern areas, witnesses said on Tuesday.\n",
      "On Monday, Israeli forces targeted Gaza’s main north-south road and attacked Gaza City, its northern hub, from two directions.Gaza health authorities say that 8,525 people, including 3,542 children, have been killed in Israeli attacks since Oct. 7. U.N. officials say more than 1.4 million of Gaza’s civilian population of about 2.3 million have been made homeless.\n",

In Beit Hanoun, in the northeast, they “liquidated” an Israeli unit which was ambushed as it entered a building.\n",

      "Air raid sirens sounded in the area of Israel’s far southern resort city of Eilat on the Red Sea on Tuesday and the Israeli military said it downed an approaching “aerial target”.\n",
      "Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthis said they had launched a “large number” of ballistic missiles and drones towards Israel, their third operation targeting Israel, with more to come.The mounting death toll in Gaza has drawn calls from the United States, Israel’s main ally, other countries and the U.N. for a pause in fighting to allow in more humanitarian aid.\n",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking in Washington, stressed the importance of both security assistance for Israel and humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza.\n",
      "“Without swift and sustained humanitarian relief, the conflict is much more likely to spread, suffering will grow, and Hamas and its sponsors will benefit by fashioning themselves as the saviours of the very desperation they created,” he said.\n",

      "A World Health Organization official in Geneva said on Tuesday that a “public health catastrophe” was imminent in Gaza.\n",
      "Air strikes on Monday night outside the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza caused a power cut and doctors said they feared for the lives of 250 injured Palestinians being treated there as fuel runs low.\n",
      "“Running out of fuel would mean no power and no power would mean the inevitable death of many patients,” Dr. Moaeen Al-Masri said.James Elder, a spokesperson for the U.N. children’s agency in Geneva, warned of the risk of infant deaths due to dehydration. Children in Gaza were getting sick from drinking salty water, he said.\n",

      " The verbal duel between the two followed CM’s severe criticism of a post by Chandrasekhar on social media platform X in which the union minister seemed to place blame on a particular community for the multiple blasts on Sunday at a Christian gathering near Kochi that killed three persons and injured over 50.\n",
      " On Sunday after reports of the blasts came out, Chandrasekhar had posted on X — “Dirty shameless appeasement politics by a discredited CM (and HM) @pinarayivijayan besieged by corruption charges. Sitting in Delhi and protesting against Israel, when in Kerala open calls by Terrorist Hamas for Jihad is causing attacks and bomb blasts on innocent Christians.” Criticising Chandrasekhar’s post, Vijayan at a press conference in the evening said that the statements by the BJP leader were a reflection of his “absolute communal outlook”.\n",
      " Hitting back at the CM for his remarks, Chandrasekhar on Monday accused Vijayan of being a “liar” and using terms like ‘communal’ and ‘communalism’ to “hide his ineptness as Home Minister of the state” and “cover up his own and his government’s corruption and appeasement politics that he has copied from the Congress.” Speaking to reporters in Kochi on Monday afternoon, he further alleged that Kerala under Vijayan has shown tolerance towards radical elements and radicalisation. Chandrasekhar said he did not mention any community in his post on X, and sought to turn the attack back against the CM for calling him communal, saying, “I had talked about Hamas and it was almost like the CM was trying to equate Hamas with the broader Muslim brothers and sisters of our state and country.” He further alleged that both the Congress and the Left in Kerala have a history of appeasement of radical elements in the state.\n",

      " The CM said that he does not know what the intention was behind the Union MoS’s statements, but if it was aimed at destroying the purity of the state, it would not be allowed. He also said that Chandrasekhar was “not just poisonous”, but “extremely venomous”.\n",

      "U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria have been attacked at least 20 times since Oct. 17 by Iran-backed groups, triggering U.S. air strikes last week against two unoccupied arms storage facilities in Syria. But those attacks, which were meant to deter further attacks, have failed to do so, with near daily attempts to strike American forces in both countries.Austin said that if such attacks do not cease, “We will respond.”\n",
      "Blinken said U.S. support for Ukraine has made Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “a strategic debacle” and stressed the importance of both security assistance for Israel and humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza.\n",
      "“Without swift and sustained humanitarian relief, the conflict is much more likely to spread, suffering will grow, and Hamas and its sponsors will benefit by fashioning themselves as the saviors of the very desperation they created,” Blinken said.\n",

Everybody was essentially asleep. And the very formidable Israeli army, the intelligence agencies, were taken by surprise.\n",
      " That’s what we know. Then we know that some of these glider-borne terrorists reached a rave festival that was taking place, killing a lot of people there who were just dancing, enjoying themselves. They were not expecting to be attacked. Also, these attacks took place in the area of Israel where security is not that heavy because people are not expecting to be attacked in these areas, Jewish settlements on the West Bank, for example, people are armed. Not in this area, because this is the Israeli mainland.\n",

      "So this is what happened. And then we know the Israelis have been retaliating since then. Now the question is what went wrong because the whole world lays such a store by Israeli intelligence, Mossad, Israeli armed forces. How could this have gone wrong? Because Israelis know that they live in a tough environment.The fact is that Israelis have forever been fighting wars for their existence in the region. And, I’m not even taking you back to the 1960s or the 1950s. But say, look at the last 20 years — 2006, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2014, 2018, 2019, 2022. That is when trouble took place at Al Aqsa Mosque following which there were lots of attacks on Israeli settlements.\n",

      "For a country in that situation and for a country which takes pride in producing the best technology in the world for intelligence, espionage, surveillance. How did they go wrong? I’m leaning on top award-winning Israeli journalist and commentator Nahum Barnea.\n",
      "Nahum Barnea is writing in a paper called Yedioth Ahronoth. And he says that four blunders have taken place. One is intelligence failure. Two, the border was breached. Because after all, you have this fence with all these protections. Three, how did Hamas manage to take hostages back into Gaza; how were they not stopped before that? And four, why were Israeli defence forces so slow in their reaction?And then he explains, first of all, he says, intelligence ignored many warnings that existed even earlier. So he says, first of all, intelligence failure lies in the fact, not because Hamas was so clever, but because there were many indications. Just as it happened in 1973 Yom Kippur war, that there were many indications that Egyptians may be launching an attack.\n",
      "Israeli intelligence dismissed it as just idle training. If people are training to use hang gliders or motorised gliders, you would normally think what are they planning, right? But in this case, Israeli intelligence probably concluded that this was just idle training. This will not lead to anything.\n",
      "In fact, Yedioth Ahronoth article says at 3.5 billion shekels, it’s a very expensive fence. It’s sensors above it, under it, on it, and around it. The important thing is it’s an unmanned fence because you rely so much on technology and alarms. The belief is that if anybody tries to cross it, touch it, come near it, there’ll be an alarm and somebody will immediately take action. That is excellent as long as you are only seeing a threat from the odd infiltrator or a group of terrorists, maybe 4 or 10 who are trying to cross the fence and come in because even if they cross it, you can catch them somewhere. You are not prepared for large masses of people coming in on their own vehicles or bulldozers and crushing this fence. That’s what happened.\n",
      "That is the first two failures, the intelligence failures, the indications were there, but everybody thought it was just idle training and two, how the border was breached.So Nahum Barnea also points out to the fact that so many of these people came in and the IDF seemed to be in such deep sleep and so complacent that these terrorists are walking around one of the big Israeli army tank bases as if it was their own. You’ve seen those pictures of Hamas having taken away an Israeli main battle tank. And then I quote from Nahum Barnea: “I suddenly felt like I do not live in Israel, which I am proud of, but in Somalia.”\n",
      "These are very strong words. So what went wrong? Second question is answered with these four failures that we just described for you.\n",
      "Also Read: Palestinians stuck between ‘Islamic & Jewish fundamentalists’, says Palestine activist\n",
      "Third question, how did Hamas justify this and motivate people? Because after all these people coming in would have known that chances of their going back alive or going back as free people are very poor. Some went back with hostages. Yes, they escaped. And for how long do they live? I don’t know because the Israelis are raining hell over Gaza now, but Hamas had a war cry and that war cry we understand from the name that they chose for this operation: ‘Operation Al-Aqsa Flood’.\n",
      "Al Aqsa is the name of the mosque in East Jerusalem. Al Aqsa is the third holiest place for Muslims. Now Al Aqsa has been in the news over the past two years. \n",
      "Clashes between Israeli security forces and Palestinian Muslims break out routinely at Al Aqsa but in the last two years, 2022 and 2023, in the month of Ramzan, clashes have been really bad. It was because of anger over Israeli action at Al Aqsa that Hamas was able to motivate their cadres. And that’s also one of the reasons Hamas and its operations are finding such wide support in the Islamic world.\n",
      "If you go to social media and you see pictures of Israelis who have been killed, who have been maimed, who have been taken as hostages, who are being beaten, dragged by their hair, women being dragged by their hair and taken as hostages. Immediately the response you get from social media from critics of Israelis that see this is what the Israeli armed forces have been doing to unarmed devout Arabs, including old women, children in Al Aqsa Mosque.There is a difference of degree but when passions are hot, nobody looks at nuance. So that is how Hamas has been able to justify it to the larger support base of Palestinians across the world or the larger community of Israeli critics across the world, and also to motivate their own cadres.\n",
      "In our Episode 744, that was almost three years back, we had explained to you what Al Aqsa Mosque is and what is the complexity of East Jerusalem. That is when the Sheikh Jarrah riots had broken out.\n",
      "Now, I will once again explain this to you because Al Aqsa is so central to this. Al Aqsa is not close to where Gaza is. In fact, I will share with you a map that my colleagues have drawn that tells you the map of Israel where Gaza is located and the respective range of many missiles that Hamas has.\n",
      "This also tells you where East Jerusalem is. So Al Aqsa is located there. Jerusalem was divided in 1948. In 1948, there was a war between the Jewish settlers who were coming in at that point, mostly from Europe because they were escaping the Holocaust and they had been promised a country of their own. So at the conclusion of that war, Jerusalem was divided, West Jerusalem remained with the Israelis, East Jerusalem was in a kind of mixed control. It was until 1967 mostly not in Israeli control. In the six-day war of 1967, Israelis went and took over East Jerusalem. But the status of East Jerusalem still remains uncertain.\n",
      "Al Aqsa Mosque, in a way means the last mosque or the most distant mosque. The story is the Prophet started from the holy mosques of Mecca and Medina, he came as far as Jerusalem and it is from here, from the shrine, a very picturesque shrine — Dome of the Rock — that the Holy Prophet ascended to heaven to meet Allah on his winged, lightning horse Buraq, and came back very quickly because Allah then introduced him also to many of the other Prophets over there, including Prophet Jesus, Prophet Adam and all the others, Prophet Jacob. It is also the place which is holy to Jews because Jews think this is where Abraham offered his son in sacrifice to God. But God revealed himself and didn’t let him do it.\n",
      "Remember these three great faiths: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. And I’m not listing them like this in any order of importance or any order of preference. I’m only listing them chronologically because Judaism came first, then came Christianity and then Islam. For all three, this little piece of real estate is their holiest. For the Jews, their Second Temple built by Herod in 516 BCE and was destroyed in 70 CE by the Romans, stood there. It is on top of that second temple of the Jews that the Dome of the Rock is supposedly located.\n",
      "This is really Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi multiplied several times over. And remember just walking distance, maybe if you don’t have many people in the street, just a few minutes away is the Church of the Holy Sepulchre — that’s where Jesus Christ was crucified and resurrected. So for Jews Christians and Muslims, this little patch is among their holiest places and definitely the most disputed for all three faiths.The shrine itself, the Al Aqsa Mosque was built and rebuilt several times. In 8th century AD, a prayer hall was built by Umar the second, the second caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate, in the place where it was said that the Prophet prayed before he ascended to heaven. Then subsequently, Abd al-Malik, who was the fifth caliph of the Umayyad Caliphate, built a larger structure there. In 1033, Dome of the Rock or the shrine of Dome of the Rock or the mosque took shape. The mosque has been there since then.\n",
      "And you know what happens because any time there’s festival season just as it used to happen in the days of communal riots in our country. In this place, if the month of Ramzan coincides with the Jewish week of Passover, then people go in the same area to pray. And you know who has the state power. It’s the Israelis. Clashes took place in 2022. The month of Ramzan was April 2 to May 2. Trouble had started there even earlier before Ramzan began. April 15 to April 23 was the week of Passover. Easter was April 17.\n",
      "I told you all three Abrahamic faiths. It’s an irony. All faiths, all three faiths are Abrahamic faiths and all three at this point are contesting this space.\n",
      "The Christians are not part of this trouble right now. It is entirely the Muslims and the Jews. In 2022, clashes took place, again Israeli security forces went in. There was a lot of beating, use of rubber bullets, etc. and then reprisals by Palestinians. Many Jewish settlements were attacked in that melee of stuff that followed after the Al Aqsa action in 2022, 17 Jewish Israelis were killed.Once again this year, 2023, the month of Ramzan was 22 March to 20 April. Passover was 5 April to 12 April and Easter was 9 April. Trouble broke out on 15 April and pictures of the trouble went around the entire world, particularly the Muslim world. These came handy for Hamas.\n",

      "Now, fourth question, what’s the global reaction? We’ve seen that the entire Western world has condemned this unequivocally.

Somebody reminds us of ‘root causes’.\n",
      "You haven’t settled the Kashmir problem or you did this in Ayodhya or Babri Masjid or you did this in such and such place. We say this is nonsense. Don’t give us the ‘root causes’ theory. When 26/11 happened and Mumbai was attacked, UPA was in power. The UPA government also completely dismissed anybody who would have said what about any root causes. Just because you have a problem in Kashmir. You can’t just come anywhere, in this case Mumbai and start killing innocent people. So there is no ‘root causes’ justification.But generally, the Western world is fully with Israel.\n",

      "Now, I will share with you a long 2021 article by Anthony Cordesman, who is one of the foremost and senior most strategic affairs experts sitting in Washington and is currently Emeritus Chair and Arleigh A. Burke Chair in Strategy at Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). I’ve taken this paper from the CSIS website. I will share a link to the full paper with you. Please check it out, read it patiently but basically five points that he has made and I will leave it at that.• Number one, he says that wars in 2006, 2008-9, 2012, 2014, 2018, 2019, 2022 have shown that Israeli might, Israeli armed forces are formidable but they have been unable to decisively degrade the terrorist firepower or manpower or the ability of the terrorists to strike at Israel.\n",
      "• Number two, Israel has an overwhelming military advantage. But in built-up areas, that is neutralised because cities are unpredictable and expose the limitations of modern armies as shown by the US armed forces in Afghanistan and Iraq. Gaza, as you know, is fully built-up. Also, built-up areas really degrade technology because technology works when you have open ground. If you’re going from house to house, apartment to apartment, street to street, technology still helps, but it does degrade very fast.\n",
      "• Number three, Iron Dome, which Israel uses, is great. It’s very expensive. But the fact is that Hamas is also improving and Hamas has large quantities of these rockets. And as Joseph Stalin famously said, something like ‘quantity itself is a quality’.\n",
      "• Fourth point from Cordesman, stalemate is bad for all. That there should be a solution but to think that there can be an Arab-Israeli deal by passing the Palestinians, it’s not going to happen. That’s unsustainable. You will have to get the Palestinians on board for any deal or any settlement. It’s not as if the Saudis and the Israelis can settle something and bury the hatchet in the Palestinians’ back. That is unsustainable, that’s not going to happen.• And finally, he says, not solving this situation is not a solution as it has created four failed Palestinian states. What are these four failed Palestinian states?\n",
      "I will tell you from Cordesman: the first, Gaza with Hamas; second, West Bank with Palestinian Authority — Palestinian Authority and Hamas, by the way, are political rivals — third, Israeli Arabs, these are Arabs who live in Israel. The West Bank is about 3 million Palestinians, mostly Muslim, some Christian; and Gaza, a little over 2 million.\n",
      "And then you have Israeli Arabs. These are Arabs who live in Israel, who have the right to vote. Not all the rights that Jews have, for example, under a law passed by the Knesset, Israeli Arabs cannot criticise the Israeli State. Whereas in Israel, anybody can criticise the Palestinians. That is also from Cordesman’s paper.\n",
      "So it’s almost 7 million Palestinians under three different entities.He says each one of these is a failed state, as is East Jerusalem. That makes it four failed states. Gaza under Hamas is a failed state, number one. Second, the West Bank and Palestinian Authority is a failed state. And then, in a most stunning conclusion he says, if this goes on, this could create Israel as a fifth failed state as its politics has declined from an effective democracy to “something beginning to approach ‘chaocracy’”.\n",

      "Asked whether US President Joe Biden feels that Israel abides by the rule of war, Kirby said, “Without getting into, reacting to events on the ground in real-time, which we are just not going to do, this is a conversation we consistently have had with our Israeli counterparts. As you rightly know, that was part of the discussion yesterday with the prime minister, and you heard the prime minister today speaking in Tel Aviv about the efforts that they’re undertaking to try to avoid civilian casualties, and I think that they certainly are making that effort.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It doesn’t mean that there haven’t been civilian casualties tragically, there have been many, thousands of them, but unlike Putin in Ukraine, and unlike what Hamas did on October 7, killing civilians is not a war aim of the Israeli Defence Forces. Their war aim is to go after Hamas terrorists, terrorists I might add, that are using innocent Palestinians as human shields,” he added.\n",
      "John Kirby that Netanyahu brings up the issue of civilian casualties in Gaza in conversations with US President Joe Biden and that both leaders “recognize that as democracies, it’s important to abide by the law of war, to protect innocent life and to and to try to minimize civilian casualties.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In response to a question on why Biden is repeatedly calling for fighting the war in a manner consistent with international humanitarian law, he said, “Because it is something that even the Prime Minister brings up in the conversation. They both recognize that as democracies, it’s important to abide by the law of war, to protect innocent life and to try to minimize civilian casualties. It’s not a lecturing, it’s a reminder from two leaders of two vibrant democracies, that this is what separates us from folks like Hamas.”\n",
      "He noted that there is not a single conversation that the US has not had with Israeli counterparts to better understand what efforts they are making to minimize civilian casualties. He said that the US is leading the effort to try to get humanitarian assistance into Gaza.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s not a single conversation we haven’t had with our Israeli counterparts to better understand what they’re doing to try to minimize civilian casualties and again, as friends can and friends should do with one another, to make sure that we’re on the same page about that,” he said.\n",
      "“And the United States is literally leading the effort to try to get humanitarian assistance into Gaza and if it wasn’t, quite frankly, for American leadership, I don’t think you’d see in fact, I know you wouldn’t see the increase of the aid getting in. Again, we know that there’s a lot that needs to be done. But, it’s because of the American leadership on the ground and American convening power that we are able to get that aid in and …We are really working very hard at this. Every single innocent life lost is a tragedy. Everyone whether it is a Palestinian life lost or an Israeli life lost, everyone should be prevented. There is no reason for these families to keep grieving and we are going to keep doing everything we can to work with Israeli counterparts on the minimisation of civilian casualties,” he added.\n",

Smaller countries fear becoming collateral damage in competition between great powers,” Guterres said.\n",

      " “This small country has made an outsized contribution to international peace…you are preparing the final stages of your peace process – healing the wounds of war through transitional justice. A process that must help to bring peace to victims, families and communities haunted by questions, and scarred by injustice; and help put the past to rest,” he noted.\n",
      " The UN chief underscored the need to implement the transitional justice mechanism saying, “Transitional justice can play a vital role in securing lasting peace.” Over 17,000 people were killed and thousands were displaced, mostly throughout rural Nepal, during the armed Maoist movement in Nepal that lasted from 1996 to 2006. The conflict began on February 1996, when the CPN (Maoist) initiated an insurgency to overthrow the Nepali monarchy and establish a people’s republic. The revolution ended with the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Accord on November 2006.\n",

Underlining the disastrous impact of global warming, Guterres said, “Glaciers are melting at records…The effect is devastating. Swollen lakes bursting, rivers and seas rising, cultures threatened. And mountain sides exposed, inflaming the risk of rock slides, landslides and avalanche.” He said the world must act now to protect people on the frontline and to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The UN chief also appealed to the international community to donate funding to help build resilience in effected communities.\n",
      " As climate catastrophe is accelerating with a deadly force, the world could learn much from Nepal in responding to these crises, Guterres said.\n",

      "United Nations, Oct 31 (PTI) UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday expressed deep alarm over the intensifying Israel-Hamas conflict, including expansion of ground operations by the Israel army, asserting that international humanitarian law is not an a la carte menu and cannot be applied selectively and all parties must abide by it.\n",
      "The UN chief reiterated his call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and for unimpeded humanitarian access to be granted consistently, safely and to scale in order to meet the urgent needs created by the catastrophe unfolding in Gaza.\n",
      "“I am deeply alarmed by the intensification of the conflict between Israel and Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups in Gaza. This includes the expansion of ground operations by the Israel Defence Forces accompanied by intense air strikes, and the continued rocket fire towards Israel from Gaza,” Guterres said in a statement on the situation in Gaza.\n",
      "“I remain deeply concerned about the risk of a dangerous escalation beyond Gaza and urge all leaders to exercise utmost restraint to avoid a wider conflagration,” said Guterres, who is currently in Nepal on an official visit.The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that on October 30, significant Israeli ground operations within Gaza continued for the fourth consecutive day, alongside intense bombardments.\n",
      "A total of 304 Palestinians were killed in Gaza on October 29, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. This brings the cumulative fatality toll reported in Gaza since the start of hostilities to 8,309, of whom 70 per cent are said to be children and women, OCHA said.\n",
      "Guterres added that civilians have borne the brunt of the current fighting from the outset. Protection of civilians on both sides is paramount and must be respected at all times.\n",
      "“International humanitarian law establishes clear rules that cannot be ignored. It is not an a la carte menu and cannot be applied selectively. All parties must abide by it, including the principles of distinction, proportionality, and precaution,” Guterres said.He voiced concern that with too many Israeli and Palestinian lives already lost, this escalation only increases the immense suffering of civilians.\n",
      "OCHA noted that Palestinian armed groups’ indiscriminate rocket firing towards Israeli population continued over the past 24 hours, with no fatalities reported.\n",
      "Overall, about 1,400 Israelis and foreign nationals have been killed in Israel, according to the Israeli authorities, the vast majority on October 7 when the current conflict started after Hamas’ attack on Israel. According to the Israeli authorities, 238 people are held captive in Gaza, including Israelis and foreign nationals.\n",
      "Guterres also voiced concern at the level of humanitarian assistance that has been allowed into Gaza up to this point, describing it as “completely inadequate and not commensurate with the needs of people in Gaza, compounding the humanitarian tragedy.” On October 30, a total of 26 trucks carrying humanitarian supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt. OCHA noted that while the increase in the volume of aid entering Gaza during the past two days is welcome, it said current amounts are a fraction of what is needed to prevent further deterioration in the already-dire humanitarian situation, including civil unrest.Guterres repeated his “utter condemnation” of the acts of terror perpetrated by Hamas on October 7. “There is never any justification for the killing, injuring and abduction of civilians,” Guterres said, adding that he appeals for the immediate and unconditional release of those civilians held hostage by Hamas.\n",
      "He also condemned the killing of civilians in Gaza and said he is dismayed by reports that two-thirds of those who have been killed are women and children.\n",
      "Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths told the UN Security Council that the deliveries into Gaza via the Rafah border are a “drop in the ocean” compared to the vast scale of needs.\n",
      "Guterres also mourned and honoured the United Nations colleagues who have tragically been killed in the bombardment of Gaza over the past three weeks.OCHA said that as of October 30, more than 1.4 million people in Gaza were internally displaced, with nearly 672,000 sheltering in 150 United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) facilities.

      "New Delhi: The word ‘Israel’ appears to have been scrubbed from online digital maps maintained by Chinese companies Baidu and Alibaba. \n",
      "After The Wall Street Journal reported this late Monday, ThePrint accessed these platforms Tuesday and verified that this remained the case.\n",
      "In the case of Baidu, the border lines between Israel and the Palestinian territories — the West Bank and Gaza — are clearly demarcated, as are major cities like Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. However, no names are given to mark Israel or the Palestinian territories as a whole, although a search for the term “Israel” in Mandarin directs to a zoomed-out version of the entire Israel-Palestine region. \n",
      "Alibaba’s Amap, on the other hand, is far vaguer in its presentation of the region, with the territory on the map just appearing as a blank space. Neither are the borderlines between Israeli territory, the West Bank and Gaza marked, nor do any names of urban areas located within these territories show up. A search for the term “Israel” in Mandarin redirects to Israeli consular services in China. The Journal’s report added that this ambiguous removal of the country labels on the maps “matches Beijing’s vague diplomacy in the region and contrasts with its attentiveness to maps generally…China’s government has over the years cried foul and levied fines over maps published elsewhere online, such as on hotel websites, for failing to strictly adhere to Beijing’s territorial claims, like leaving off a nine-dotted line stretching around the South China Sea that isn’t internationally recognised.”\n",
      "China historically supported the Palestinian cause and a two-state solution, having supplied arms to the Palestine Liberation Organization, but has since evolved to become a significant trading partner with Israel today. \n",
      "However, China’s initial statement on the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war was controversial in its lack of direct condemnation of Hamas’ attack on Israeli civilians on 7 October. \n",
      "“The recurrence of the conflict shows once again that the protracted standstill of the peace process cannot go on. The fundamental way out of the conflict lies in implementing the two-state solution and establishing an independent State of Palestine. The international community needs to act with greater urgency, step up input into the Palestinian question, facilitate the early resumption of peace talks between Palestine and Israel, and find a way to bring about enduring peace,” the statement reads. China’s foreign minister Wang Yi has since said that every country has the right to self-defence, while also asserting that Israel’s retaliatory actions on Gaza since the Hamas attack had gone well-beyond the scope of self defence.\n",

      "New Delhi: This year, Durga Puja did not bring joy to Joyanta Karmoker. As neighbourhood Hindus came to wish him Shubho Bijoya and his social media filled with greetings, the 27-year-old activist recounts the attacks on Durga idols and puja pandals across Bangladesh. The ruling party Awami League, however, has gone to town claiming it was all peaceful this year.\n",
      "Between these competing claims hangs Bangladesh’s fragile social peace where the Hindu minority has been increasingly pushed into a corner of low expectations and gratitude in recent years. It’s in these times that Karmoker looks at Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi with hope and admiration. He is one of Bangladesh’s biggest Modi fans and a chronicler of injustices.\n",
      "“Hindus were not killed this year during Durga Puja. Nor did murderous Islamist mobs attack puja pandals in front of TV cameras. But hate has been so normalised that we ignore the fact that in several villages and towns, Durga idols were broken. A man was caught red-handed trying to put copies of the Quran inside puja pandals and create a situation like 2021,” the Hindu rights activist tells ThePrint over phone from Patuakhali village in Barisal district.\n",
      "Today, Karmoker uses social media to keep a record of anti-Hindu violence in Bangladesh, not just during Durga Puja but throughout the year, as well as put up stories and accounts of survivors because he says mainstream media often doesn’t. It is a hate tracker of sorts, he says, for anyone who wants to know how difficult it can get for a practising Hindu in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.There was a time when Karmoker would post information on any attack on Hindus in Bangladesh that he got to know about. The draconian Digital Security Act has made him cautious. His timeline is filled with posts on Hindu civilisational ethos and heritage. In a recent post on Facebook, he talks about shastra puja and the need for Hindus to learn self-defence. On Twitter, Karmoker follows Indian influencers from the Hindu right. He retweets regularly.\n",
      "Karmoker’s voice wavers as he remembers how in 2021, a copy of the Quran was placed at the feet of Hanuman in a puja pandal in Cumilla district, which led to attacks on Hindus across Bangladesh, resulting in the killing of four devotees and injuries to several others. “2021 Durga Puja made international headlines. 2023 attacks were not covered even by the local press. Few talk about attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh unless they happen on a large scale. I do my bit by writing Facebook posts and tweeting,” he says.\n",
      "In today’s secular Bangladesh, religious freedoms appear conditional as the government treads a fine line, mindful of not upsetting the majority. The Islamic Foundation, a government religious agency, reportedly sent directives asking authorities to “stop or limit Durga Puja rituals” during namaz timings. The puja celebrations involve playing of drums throughout the day.\n",
      "Also read: The safest place for Hindus in Bangladesh — Jagannath Hall, Dhaka UniversityThe idea to maintain a record of attacks on Hindus came early to Karmoker. A childhood incident made him realise if Hindus do not speak up for themselves, no one else will. When his father, a village goldsmith, was picked up by the police and harassed over what Karmoker says was a bogus allegation of a business deal gone wrong, there was no one to stand by him. Growing up, he saw the country of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman—that promised land for citizens of all faiths—discriminate against Hindus and other religious minorities.\n",
      "Karmoker also tries to reach wherever there is violence against Hindus.\n",
      "“I do not have a job. The family income is meagre and so are my resources. But I helped survivors of anti-Hindu violence in Rangpur in 2021 with whatever donations I could crowdfund. Their shops and huts were gutted. We helped rebuild their lives,” he says.\n",
      "Karmoker does his social work alone. He says being part of an organisation means losing the freedom to do what he thinks is right. Organisations often have their priorities and politics, while his work is for any Hindu in need. Friends in his village and outside, whom he refuses to name for reasons of safety, help him with funds to aid survivors of attacks.Karmoker is not part of any association. Deliberately so, he says, as associations tend to become political in no time. “They sing the song that is given to them. Like almost no one will tell you there were attacks on Durga pandals this year,” he says.\n",
      "Avijit Majumder Hridoy, a Bangladeshi journalist from Pirojpur district who works for the Bengali TV news channel Kolkata TV, claims to have seen broken idols inside a pandal at Tambulkhana Bazaar in Faridpur this year. “The head of the idol of Lord Ganesh, both hands of the Laxmi idol and Durga idol’s arms were broken. Durga idol’s fingers were taken off. The same fingers that hold weapons to slay the demon,” Hridoy tells ThePrint. The journalist claims this happened just before Durga Puja celebrations began and the pandal was left unguarded.\n",
      "There were at least seven such alleged incidents of breaking of idols across Bangladesh, says Karmoker, but mainstream media in the country have not covered them. “Displaying Hindu religious symbolism is fraught with danger in today’s Bangladesh. Be it Durga puja celebrations or simply wearing sindoor as a Hindu married woman, you can come under attack anywhere at any time,” he says.\n",
      "Karmoker’s Modi bhakti (devotion) has turned some friends and strangers into staunch critics. He says it amazes him that while India and Bangladesh share friendly relations, putting up posts supporting the Indian PM gets him into trouble in Bangladesh.“I have been called an RSS agent, an Indian agent and whatnot on social media and elsewhere for being a Modi fan. I like him because here is a world leader who is unapologetically Hindu, someone who is proud of his roots and his civilisational ethos. Why is it a problem if a Bangladeshi Hindu becomes his fan?” asks Karmoker.\n",
      "Modi has enjoyed quite a rapport with Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina ever since he came to power in 2014 and has prioritised the neighbouring country to work toward resolving historical issues and strengthening trade ties that has benefitted Dhaka. However, the Indian PM isn’t popular among the Muslim majority there. His 2021 visit to the country to take part in Bangladesh’s 50th Independence Day celebrations led to protests in which 12 people died.\n",
      "Karmoker says a sizeable population of Hindus in Bangladesh admire Modi as a leader. There are also many Muslims in Bangladesh who look up to him. But many would not be vocal about it, knowing they would be criticised. Or worse. There is nothing wrong about being an unapologetic Hindu like Modi, says Karmoker, because Hinduism can teach the world to be truly secular and peaceful.\n",
      "“Looking at the crisis in Russia-Ukraine or Israel-Palestine, I feel the teachings of Sanatan Dharma need to spread across the world. Sanatan Dharma doesn’t teach war. It doesn’t tell you to behead women and children. It advocates universal brotherhood and peace. When religious leaders in Bangladesh abuse Hindus, I feel there is someone like Modi who stands proudly for all Hindus in the world,” says Karmoker.This is not a worldview that finds takers, at least in public, among too many young Hindus in Bangladesh. Nilay Kumar Biswas, organising secretary of Bangladesh Journalism Students Council, says extremism in any religion is unacceptable to him. “Yes, there is Islamic fundamentalism, but the answer to that is not to say that any other religion is superior. We should learn to live next to each other in peace without turning supremacists.”\n",

      "Karmoker says things have been better under Sheikh Hasina. But Bangladeshi society still discriminates against Hindus. He hopes after the upcoming national elections, Bangladesh would change for the better. Karmoker says his country has made exponential progress in infrastructural development but social indices need more focussed attention. “Make Hindus a part of the growth story. A section of the Hindu population has progressed in this country but not all Hindu lives have been transformed. During Durga Puja as well as during elections, Hindu citizens live in fear of violent attacks to their lives and properties. I want my government to protect me from communalism and make me feel that I am as much a part of this country as a Muslim is,” says Karmoker.\n",
      "The activist says even Hindu MPs often fail to address Hindu grievances in Parliament. “I dream of a Bangladesh where at least a Hindu MP can speak free about the rights of fellow Hindus. We debate over Israel and Palestine. Let us also take a harder look at our country,” he says.The Bangladesh government has come out in support of Palestine. On the streets of Dhaka, there are processions to express solidarity with Gazans in their hour of need.\n",
      "For himself, Karmoker wants the controversial Digital Security Act to go. The legislation makes his work extremely difficult as it gives law enforcement agencies the power to arrest anyone, search any premises, and seize any equipment without a warrant. “Journalists, civil rights activists and NGO workers have been arrested under this Act. Now imagine how tough my job is,” says Karmoker.\n",
      "HIs fears are not his alone. Coming into force on 1 October 2018, the law has been criticised within Bangladesh and outside for muzzling free speech on the internet. In an article published by the American think-tank Carnegie Endowment for International Peace on 9 December 2021, Ali Riaz, Bangladeshi American political scientist, wrote that the Act is a telltale sign of Bangladesh’s ongoing slide toward authoritarianism.\n",

      "“Greece condemns in absolute terms Hamas and the killings, the crimes that have been committed and considers Hamas to be a terrorist organisation. There cannot be a solution to the Middle East conflict without the dissolution of the Hamas terrorist organisation. A solution should be advanced and implemented through political dialogue,” said the Greek envoy in an interview with ANI on Tuesday.\n",
      "The ongoing war between Israel and Hamas also brought to the forefront discussions about the future of the India-Middle East-Europe Corridor (IMEC). The Greek envoy while weighing in on this matter, emphasised that the corridor is an “absolute necessity,” to India’s economic landscape, adding it could experience some delays but may proceed without significant hindrance.\n",

      "Ambassador Ioannou, while speaking at an Observer Research Foundation event, also highlighted the significance of the India-Middle East Corridor as an alternative to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) for the Indian economy. He stressed that this corridor, which has been in the planning stages, is deemed a necessity.\n",
      "“It seems to me a very peculiar thing why this idea about the economic corridor did not appear to some minds ten or five years before because it seems to me like an absolute necessity. India Middle East Corridor is an absolutely necessary alternative to China’s BRI for the Indian economy. It will be built one way or another,” said the Greek envoy at the ORF event.\n",

      "The Ambassador also mentioned that it could experience some delays but may proceed without significant hindrance. “And I don’t know whether it will be delayed by the unhappy events now but I think that economic necessity is the strongest motivation in international relations. So it can be a delay of one or two years or it can be no delay at all because the fact is that this is still a project on paper and we don’t know how long it will take,” he added.\n",
      "Greece firmly supports the concept of a two-state solution and emphasises the importance of safeguarding innocent civilian lives in the region. “First, we condemn the atrocities made by Hamas. Hamas is a terrorist organisation. We would not be able to have a solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict without a solution on the end of Hamas. It is a factor to play in this situation…Second, we believe in the solution of two states…The lives of innocent civilians should be saved and protected…,” said Ambassador Ioannou in an interview with ANI.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an interesting observation, Ambassador Ioannou revealed the immense popularity of Indian actress Nargis in Greece during the 1960s. The cultural connection, according to them, illustrates that India was not perceived as a distant country but was well-known in Greece. “The most popular actress in Greece in the in the 60s was Nargis. I remember that my mother was drawn from the cinemas to the movies to watch the movies of Nargis. I always sing the song from Mother India. So Greeks, in many ways, for many reasons, they were very much informed about India. India was not at all such a distant country as China,” he added.\n",
      "Additionally, Ambassador Ioannou highlighted the substantial maritime cooperation between Greece and India. “Greece has the biggest maritime fleet in the world…If at this moment there is an Indian product delivered somewhere around the world to its final consumer, there is one chance in five that it was transported by a Greek ship. It’s the same the other way around where something is delivered at this, moment here in India coming from abroad. There is also a 1.5 chance that it was transported by the Greek fleet…That means that even without waiting for the economic corridor to be built and completed the Greek merchant fleet contributed to the development and the growth of the Indian economy. And it will continue doing so in the coming years…”\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding Greece’s support for India in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), Ambassador Ioannou reaffirmed Greece’s backing, emphasising the necessity of India’s participation in the UNSC due to its status as the most populous country, which holds considerable influence in international diplomacy. He said, “From the very first moment Greece has been supportive and we will support it because it is absolutely necessary that the most populous country be a part of the Security Council. India is a factor in international diplomacy…”\n",

      "By Humeyra Pamuk and Michael MartinaWASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. and China have agreed to work together toward an expected summit between presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping next month, U.S. officials said on Friday, following hours of meetings between Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi and senior U.S. diplomats in Washington.\n",
      "In the first visit by a Chinese foreign minister to Washington since 2018, veteran diplomat Wang Yi also met Biden for an hour, talks that the White House described as a “good opportunity” in keeping lines of communication open between the two geopolitical rivals with deep policy differences.\n",
      "Wang’s meetings with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. national security advisor Jake Sullivan spanning over two days totaled nine hours, U.S. officials said, describing these interactions as “candid and in-depth”.\n",
      "Biden’s top aides raised Washington’s key concerns: the need to restore military-to-military channels between the two countries, Beijing’s actions in the East and South China Sea, Taiwan, human rights, the flow of fentanyl precursors and the cases of Americans detained in China, U.S. officials said.There were also “frank exchanges” between Blinken and Wang over the erupting conflict in the Middle East.\n",
      "The key area that appeared to show some positive momentum was toward an expected meeting between Biden and Xi on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit next month in San Francisco.\n",
      "“We are making preparations for such a meeting,” a senior administration official, briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity, said. “Obviously, Chinese leaders often confirm publicly much closer to a trip, so I will leave it to the Chinese side to figure out if and when they make that announcement,” the official said.\n",
      "Wang told Biden that the objective of his visit was to help “stem the decline” in U.S.-China ties “with an eye on San Francisco”, without giving any details, according to a report from state news agency Xinhua.“China attaches importance to the U.S. side’s hopes of stabilizing and improving U.S. ties with China,” Xinhua quoted Wang as saying.\n",
      "The Biden administration has seen direct leader-level engagement with Xi as particularly important in managing tensions as it seeks to prevent relations from veering into conflict.\n",
      "“A big part of a potential meeting would be the two leaders sitting down together and having those conversations on strategic intent,” the official said.\n",
      "On Thursday, Wang told Blinken that the two countries have disagreements and need “in-depth” and “comprehensive” dialogue to reduce misunderstandings and stabilize ties. “Not only should we resume dialogue, the dialogue should be in-depth and comprehensive,” Wang said.Wang’s three-day visit follows a flurry of bilateral diplomatic engagements in recent months, largely at U.S. request, aimed at salvaging what were rapidly deteriorating ties early in the year following the U.S. downing of an alleged Chinese spy balloon.\n",
      "But some in Washington have questioned whether a slate of mostly unreciprocated U.S. cabinet-level official visits to Beijing over the past six months, including by Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, played into Beijing’s hand. \n",
      "The trips by Yellen and Raimondo led to new bilateral economic and commercial working groups, which critics worry will only pull U.S. focus away from – and possibly delay – sanctions, export controls and broader measures intended to enhance U.S. competition with China. \n",
      "U.S. officials have maintained that increased diplomacy does not mean a let up in policy. CONCERN OVER MIDDLE EAST\n",
      "The Israel-Hamas conflict has added a fresh dynamic to the testy relationship between the superpowers, and Washington is hoping Beijing can use its influence with Iran to prevent an escalation into a wider war in the Middle East.\n",
      "U.S. officials said the issue came up frequently during Wang’s meetings but it was unclear whether Washington was able to get Beijing on board to commit to using its influence to help contain the conflict.\n",
      "“We expressed our deep concern with the situation and pressed China to take a more constructive approach, and that would include, of course, their engagements with the Iranians, to urge calm,” one of the senior administration officials said.China has condemned violence and attacks on civilians in the conflict, and while Wang has declared Israel’s actions “beyond the scope of self-defense” he has not named Hamas in his comments.\n",
      "The second senior administration official said Blinken raised U.S. concerns about China’s recent actions in the South China Sea and the East China Sea, including its “dangerous and unlawful obstruction” of the Philippine resupply mission to Second Thomas Shoal in the South China Sea and its unsafe intercept of a U.S. aircraft.\n",

      "By Stephen FarrellLONDON (Reuters) –     Gaza, which thrived in antiquity as a trade centre on the Mediterranean coast where Asia meets Africa, has been inhabited for thousands of years and fought over by Egyptian Pharaohs, Babylonians, Philistines, Macedonian Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Mongols, Crusaders, Ottomans and even Napoleon.\n",
      "Part of an ancient Philistine confederacy of five cities along the coastal plain, it featured in Biblical accounts: the judge Samson was held in captivity there.\n",
      "Alexander the Great besieged and captured Gaza City, killing the men and enslaving women and children. In Roman times, Christianity spread there and a tiny Christian community in Gaza still exists – its church was damaged during the latest round of hostilities.\n",
      "Arab armies invaded 1,400 years ago and brought Islam. Gaza was part of the Ottoman Empire for most of the period from the 16th century until 1917, when was it taken by British troops during World War I.Over the last century Gaza passed from British to Egyptian to Israeli military rule. It is now a fenced-in enclave inhabited by around 2.3 million Palestinians, most of them descendants of refugees.\n",
      "Here are some of the major milestones in its recent history.\n",
      "1948 – End of British rule\n",
      "As British colonial rule came to an end in Palestine in the late 1940s, violence intensified between Jews and Arabs, culminating in war between the newly created State of Israel and its Arab neighbours in May 1948.The invading Egyptian army seized a narrow coastal strip 25 miles (40 km) long from the Sinai to just south of Ashkelon. Tens of thousands of Palestinians who fled or were driven from Israel sought shelter there, tripling the population to around 200,000.\n",
      "1950s & 1960s – Egyptian military rule\n",
      "Egypt held the Gaza Strip for two decades under a military governor, letting Palestinians work and study in Egypt. Armed Palestinian “fedayeen,” many of them refugees, mounted attacks into Israel, drawing reprisals.\n",
      "The United Nations set up a refugee agency, UNRWA, which today provides services for 1.6 million registered Palestine refugees in Gaza, as well as for Palestinians in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and the West Bank.1967 – War and Israeli military occupation\n",
      "Israel captured the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Middle East war. An Israeli census that year put Gaza’s population at 394,000, at least 60% of them refugees.\n",
      "With the Egyptians gone, many Gazan workers took jobs in the agriculture, construction and services industries inside Israel, to which they could then gain easy access. Israeli troops remained to administer the territory and guard settlements that Israel built in the following decades.\n",
      "1987 – First Palestinian uprising. Hamas formedTwenty years after the 1967 war, Palestinians launched their first intifada, or uprising, after an Israeli truck crashed into a vehicle carrying Palestinian workers in Gaza’s Jabalya refugee camp, killing four. Stone-throwing protests, strikes and shutdowns followed.\n",
      "Seizing the angry mood, the Egypt-based Muslim Brotherhood created an armed Palestinian branch, Hamas, with its power base in Gaza. Hamas, dedicated to Israel’s destruction and the restoration of Islamic rule, became a rival to Yasser Arafat’s secular Fatah party.\n",
      "1993 – The Oslo Accords, and Palestinian semi-autonomy\n",
      "Israel and the Palestinians signed an historic peace accord in 1993 that led to the creation of the Palestinian Authority.Under the interim deal, Palestinians were first given limited control in Gaza and Jericho in the West Bank. Arafat returned to Gaza after decades in exile.\n",
      "The Oslo process gave the newly created Palestinian Authority some autonomy, and envisaged statehood after five years. But that never happened. Israel accused the Palestinians of reneging on security agreements, and Palestinians were angered by continued Israeli settlement building.\n",
      "Hamas and another militant group, Islamic Jihad, carried out bombings to try to derail the peace process, leading Israel to impose more restrictions on movement of Palestinians out of Gaza. Hamas also picked up on growing Palestinian criticisms of corruption, nepotism and economic mismanagement by Arafat’s inner circle.\n",
      "2000 – Second Palestinian intifadaIn 2000, Israeli-Palestinian relations sank to a new low with the outbreak of the second Palestinian intifada. It ushered in a period of suicide bombings and shooting attacks by Palestinians, and Israeli air strikes, demolitions, no-go zones and curfews.\n",
      "One casualty was Gaza International Airport, opened in 1998. A symbol of thwarted Palestinian hopes for economic independence, it was deemed a security threat by Israel, which destroyed its radar antenna and runway a few months after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States.\n",
      "Another casualty was Gaza’s fishing industry, a source of income for tens of thousands. Gaza’s fishing zone was reduced by Israel, citing a need to stop boats smuggling weapons.\n",
      "2005 – Israel evacuates its Gaza settlementsIn August 2005 Israel evacuated all its troops and settlers from Gaza, by then completely fenced off from the outside world.\n",
      "Palestinians tore down the abandoned buildings and infrastructure for scrap. The settlements’ removal led to greater freedom of movement within Gaza, and a “tunnel economy” boomed as armed groups, smugglers and entrepreneurs quickly dug scores of tunnels into Egypt.\n",
      "But the pullout also removed settlement factories, greenhouses and workshops that had employed some Gazans.\n",
      "2006 – Isolation under HamasIn 2006, Hamas scored a surprise victory in Palestinian parliamentary elections and then seized full control of Gaza, overthrowing forces loyal to Arafat’s successor, President Mahmoud Abbas.\n",
      "Much of the international community cut aid to the Palestinians in Hamas-controlled areas, regarding Hamas as a terrorist organization.\n",
      "Israel stopped tens of thousands of Palestinian workers from entering, cutting off an important source of income.\n",
      "Citing security concerns, Israel and Egypt imposed tighter restrictions on the movement of people and goods through the Gaza crossings. Israeli air strikes crippled Gaza’s only power plant.Ambitious Hamas plans to refocus Gaza’s economy east, away from Israel, foundered. Viewing Hamas as a threat, Egypt’s military-backed leader Abdel Fattah al-Sisi closed the border with Gaza and blew up most of the tunnels. Once again isolated, Gaza’s economy went into reverse.\n",
      "Conflict cycle\n",
      "Gaza’s economy has suffered repeatedly in the cycle of conflict, attack and retaliation between Israel and Palestinian militant groups.\n",
      "Some of the worst fighting was in 2014, when Hamas and other groups launched rockets at heartland cities in Israel. Israel carried out air strikes and artillery bombardment that devastated Gaza neighbourhoods. More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, mostly civilians. Israel put the number of its dead at 67 soldiers and six civilians.2023 – Surprise attack\n",
      "While Israel was led to believe it was containing a war-weary Hamas by providing economic incentives to Gazan workers, the group’s fighters were being trained and drilled in secret.\n",
      "On Oct.7, Hamas gunmen launched a surprise attack on Israel, rampaging through towns, killing 1,400 people, mainly civilians, and taking more than 200 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli figures. Israel vowed to destroy Hamas, imposing a full siege on Gaza and hammering it with air strikes. Medical authorities in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 8,300 people have been killed, including more than 3,400 minors.\n",
