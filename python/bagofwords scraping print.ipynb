      " By Ted HessonWASHINGTON  Reuters  –     The attack by Hamas on Israel will inspire the most significant terror threat to the U S  since the rise of ISIS nearly a decade ago  FBI Director Christopher Wray said at a congressional hearing on Tuesday  Wray said that since the start of the Israeli Palestinian conflict in Gaza earlier this month  multiple foreign terrorist organizations have called for attacks against Americans and the West  significantly raising the threat posed by homegrown U S  violent extremists  “The actions of Hamas and its allies will serve as an inspiration the likes of which we haven’t seen since ISIS launched its so called caliphate several years ago ” Wray said  The remarks came during a hearing before the U S  Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee focused on threats to the United States  The U S  government has seen an increase in threats against Jews  Muslims and Arab Americans since fighting broke out in Gaza  U S  officials have said During the hearing  U S  Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said that hate directed at Jewish students in the U S  following the start of the Israeli Palestinian conflict in Gaza has added to an increase in antisemitism  The White House expressed alarm this week at reports of anti Jewish incidents at U S  universities  Tensions between pro Israel and pro Palestinian groups have sprung up on some U S  campuses  including several in New York  prompting university officials to tighten security  “Hate directed at Jewish students  communities  and institutions add to a preexisting increase in the level of antisemitism in the United States and around the world ” Mayorkas said  At a ransomware summit organized by the White House on Tuesday  Attorney General Merrick Garland said he had directed the U S  Justice Department to assist Israeli investigators probing financial flows to Hamas  including those involving cryptocurrency   Reporting

United Nations resolution on the Israel Hamas conflict  Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Saturday asserted that the move goes against everything the country has stood for  remarks that drew a sharp response from the BJP which stressed that India will never be on the side of terrorism   India on Friday abstained from voting in the UN General Assembly on a Jordan drafted resolution titled ‘protection of civilians and upholding legal and humanitarian obligations’ that called for an immediate humanitarian truce in the Israel Hamas conflict and unhindered humanitarian access in the Gaza strip   The 193 member General Assembly adopted the resolution that called for an immediate  durable and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities   In a post on X  Priyanka Gandhi quoted Mahatma Gandhi’s “an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind” to drive home her point  “I am shocked and ashamed that our country has abstained from voting for a ceasefire in Gaza ” Priyanka Gandhi said   “Our country was founded on the principles of non violence and truth  principles for which our freedom fighters laid down their lives  these principles form the basis of the constitution that defines our nationhood ” she said   They represent the moral courage of India that guided its actions as a member of the international community  she added   “To refuse to take a stand and watch in silence as every law of humanity is pulverized  food  water  medical supplies  communication and power is cut off to millions of people and thousands of men  women and children in Palestine are being annihilated goes against everything our country has stood for throughout its life as a nation ” Priyanka Gandhi said   Reacting to Priyanka Gandhi’s response  senior BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said those who are “ashamed and shocked” must realise that India will never be on the side of terrorism  “India’s Explanation of Vote – spelt this out categorically  Our position on the Israel – Palestine issue is steadfast and consistent  Those who choose to side with terror do so at their own peril… ” the former minority affairs minister said on X   “On a lighter note  Priyanka Ji  you should first educate yourself on things that are put out from your X account  Looks like people  who have no idea of Congress’s past positions on the situation  are advising you ” he said   “What is worse is that in an attempt to make you look ‘better’ than Rahul  they are making you look silly ” Naqvi added   The CPI M  and the CPI said in a joint statement that India abstaining from voting on a United Nations resolution calling for a truce in Gaza is “shocking” and shows that Indian foreign policy is now shaped by “being a subordinate ally of US imperialism”  Communist Party of India  Marxist  General Secretary Sitaram Yechury and CPI General Secretary D Raja said in the statement   titled ‘Stop this Genocidal Aggression in Gaza’   that India’s move negates its long standing support to the Palestinian cause   India has said terrorism is a “malignancy” and knows no borders  nationality or race and the world should not buy into any justification of terror acts  as it abstained on a resolution on the Israel Hamas conflict   The resolution  which garnered 121 votes in favour  44 abstentions and 14 member states voting against it  also demanded the immediate  continuous  sufficient and unhindered provision of essential goods and services to civilians throughout the Gaza Strip   According to media reports  the rising death toll in Gaza is unprecedented in the decades long Israeli Palestinian conflict   The Health Ministry in Hamas ruled Gaza said Thursday that more than 7 000 Palestinians have died in the conflict   Over 1 400 people were killed in the unprecedented attacks on Israel by Hamas on October 7  Hamas has held more than 220 people hostage in Gaza   Israel then launched retaliatory strikes which left a trail of death and destruction  PTI ASK SMN  Kochi  Oct 30  PTI  Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday said the alleged virtual address by a Hamas leader at an Islamist group’s event in the state recently would be examined by police  and if something wrong has happened  appropriate action would be taken   The CM alleged that the BJP was aiming at implicating people in false cases for merely expressing support for Palestine  and asserted that it would not be permitted in Kerala   He pointed out that the state and the country have always supported Palestine  and it is only now that the stance has changed at the Centre   Vijayan was responding to a query inviting his attention to remarks by BJP chief J P Nadda and Union Minister of State for Electronics Rajeev Chandrasekhar that neither the Left government nor the police intervened to prevent the Hamas leader’s address  The CM said the address appears to have been a recorded one  and what was said in it has to be examined   “The person referred to as a Palestinian warrior spoke at an event organised by the Solidarity Youth Movement  the youth wing of Jamaat e Islami  We need to see what he said   “It appears that the speech was a recorded one  We need to understand that issue properly ” he said  speaking to reporters at Cochin International Airport Ltd  CIAL  here   He further said that when Jamaat e Islami or any other organisation approaches the police for permission to hold an event  it is not denied  “That is what happened in the instant case ” he said  adding  “If something is wrong in that  the police will examine it  and action will be taken ” At the same time  he alleged that Chandrasekhar and his friends “are trying to find ways to lodge cases against those who are showing support for Palestine”  “They are trying to implicate them  Palestine supporters  in cases  That will not happen in Kerala ” the CM said   Referring to Hamas leader Khaled Mashal’s virtual participation in a protest programme organised by an Islamist group in the state recently against Israel’s war with the militant outfit  Nadda alleged that he spoke openly about his organisation and that the Left government was a “silent spectator”   “What does it mean  You are bringing a bad name to the land of ‘God’s Own Country’ Kerala”  Nadda said  while addressing workers of the BJP led NDA who laid siege to three of the four gates of the Kerala Secretariat in Thiruvananthapuram in protest against the alleged misrule of the Left government in the state   Chandrasekhar  at a press conference here  said the Hamas chief was given an opportunity  with no intervention by the Kerala government or police  to address a large gathering of youth and incite them with radicalism ” PTI HMP TGB ANE Washington DC  US   October 28  ANI   In a call with Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant  the US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin has “underscored the importance of protecting civilians” during operations in Gaza  the Times of Israel quoted a Pentagon official as saying on Friday   The phone call came even as the Gallant reiterated that Israel was prepared for a long and difficult ground offensive  “We are at war for the nation – it’s either us  or them” the Israel Defence Minister said in a video posted on X    According to the US Department of Defence  Secretary Austin stressed “the importance of protecting civilians during the Israel Defence Forces’ operations and focusing on the urgency of humanitarian aid delivery for civilians in Gaza ” “He also raised his focus on the need for Hamas to release all of the hostages ” the statement adds   On Friday night  the Israeli Defence Forces ramped up their ground operation into the Gaza strip  The Israeli Air Force also conducted several air strikes to back its ground operations   According to news reports emerging from the Palestinian side  internet and phone services were down across Gaza  For the last two days  IDF infantry forces and tanks have conducted limited operations in the Gaza Strip   The Times of Israel quoted IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari as saying that ground forces were expanding their activity  “In addition to the attacks that we carried out in recent days  ground forces are expanding their activity this evening  The IDF is acting with great force … to achieve the objectives of the war” the IDF spokesperson said  According to the Times of Israel  Hamas terror group’s military wing  the Izz ad Din al Qassam Brigades  said it was confronting Israeli forces in Gaza and that “violent clashes” were taking place near Beit Hanoun in the northern part of the Palestinian enclave  Meanwhile  the United Nations General Assembly on Friday adopted a major resolution on the Gaza crisis  calling for an “immediate  durable and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities ”  The resolution was criticised by the Israeli foreign minister Eli Cohen who said Israel intended to eliminate Hamas   “We reject outright the UN General Assembly despicable call for a ceasefire  Israel intends to eliminate Hamas just as the world dealt with the Nazis and ISIS” Cohen said in a post on X    As the conflict enters its 22nd day today  the Israelis are expected to further extend their ground offensive into Gaza   ANI   Fingers curled around the handles of their famous two hand steel and carbon Dadao swords  others equipped with nothing but bodies hardened by years of martial arts training  the men of Lieutenant General Song Zheyuan’s 29 Corps made their way along the woodcutters’ trails below the Great Wall of China  For two days  they had been fighting medieval style melees with Imperial Japan’s forces on the wall’s ramparts and fortified gateways  Now  General Song was preparing to take death into the enemy camp  The men of the 29 Corps  historian Jiashun Du has recorded  slaughtered the Imperial Japanese soldiers in their beds  destroyed artillery guns with grenades  and set ammunition dumps on fire  Then  as morning broke on 3 January 1933  the Chinese disappeared into the morning mist  For the very last time  the Great Wall left in disrepair since the Manchu invasion breached it in 1644 had defeated China’s enemies  Hamas’s easy defeat of Israel’s so called Iron Wall with Gaza twin lines of six metre high barbed wire fences  made from a 140 000 tons of iron and steel  backed up with an underground concrete skirt to block tunnels  and a dense array of radar  thermal cameras  movement sensors and remotely operated machine guns has set military planners across the world wondering if modern static defences are again as useless as the Great Walls which guarded medieval empires  For decades after the Second World War  static defences like the supposedly impervious Maginot Line breached by Nazi Germany in 1940 or the Atlantic Wall pulverised by the Allies in 1944 indeed seemed a folly of history  Today  though  they have returned as critical elements of border defence around the world  from the southwestern borders of the United States to India’s frontiers in Kashmir and Bangladesh Though India is testing a smart fence in Kashmir using  government sources say  sensors from Magal  which also developed the systems in Gaza and the United States problems with infiltration remain  In recent weeks  jihadist units have shown the ability to penetrate the fence  strike and exfiltrate their personnel  Fencing of the Line of Control  and the introduction of technologies like thermal imaging and ground movement sensors  do not appear to have evident correlation with terrorist infiltration  official data shows  Hamas’s ability to overwhelm the Gaza fences poses a stark question  Do these multi million dollar fences really work  Also read  Gaza’s Islamist wave can fuel jihadism in India Don’t forget the ‘Silk Letter Movement’France’s long  murderous counterinsurgency campaign in Algeria holds the key to understanding how border fences were reborn  Even with air support  a naval blockade and unsubtle arm twisting of the governments of Tunisia and Morocco  French forces had little luck interdicting Front de Libération Nationale  FLN  fighters and equipment  There was reluctance to mine the border  since insurgents in Vietnam had shown considerable skill in digging them out  and using them against the military  Lacking other options  France strung out a fence but it wasn’t a roseate success  In 1956  US military officer Timothy Bairstow records  the FLN removed a 5 km stretch  tauntingly leaving behind a page from a French military manual which read “any obstacle not covered by fire is ineffective ” The final French fence  the Morice Line  proved a formidable obstacle  though  Electrified with a 5 000 volt charge  powered by stations put up every 15 to 20 km  the Morice Line was also defended by modified naval surveillance radar  The French improved their reaction times to breaches by building roads  and using airborne forces  FLN infiltration was reduced to small groups  Elsewhere in the world  similar efforts failed  The Rhodesian counterinsurgency cordon sanitaire  scholar Martin Rupiah notes  failed because the government lacked enough troops to effectively patrol it  Zimbabwean insurgents were able to clear the minefields using spades in just two hours  False alerts from the early warning system  caused by weather conditions  contributed to the system’s ineffectiveness Forts  electronic sensors and airborne surveillance were extensively used by the US military to monitor the movements of insurgents and traffickers across Iraq’s borders with Syria and Iran  The effort  expert Robert Bateman notes  was shackled from the outset by the fact that the US could never build up the necessary density of troops to respond to electronic intelligence  The costs of this were brutal as the Islamic State overwhelmed large parts of the territory after 2006  The lesson  from Algeria to Iraq  was simple  Even though fences could be a useful tool in securing borders  there was no tech fix to the problem of getting enough troops on the ground  Left unmanned  even the most lethal minefields and fences could be penetrated  Also read  The next front in the Israel Hamas war will be Europe From the evidence available so far  Israel forgot that lesson in part because of the ideological priorities of its political leadership  Three entire battalions of soldiers  journalist Gershom Gorenberg has revealed  were moved to the West Bank on October 4  only to protect a convoy of Jewish worshippers to St  Joseph’s Tomb in Nablus  a contested religious site  Large numbers of troops were thinned from Gaza  and frittered away in small pockets guarding settlements in the West Bank The Knesset’s powerful Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee  Gorenberg writes  did not hold a single meeting on Gaza devoting its sessions  instead  to the issue of securing settlements and the roads between them  Hamas began by bombarding Israeli observation posts and remote controlled machine guns with drones  built on cheap  easily available commercial platforms  Even as Israeli command posts were blinded  it blew apart the fence with Bangalore torpedos simple pipes filled with explosives and rolled bulldozers through the gaps  As the scholar Franz Stefan Gady has argued  Israel became victim to a tech fetish  imagining devices could substitute for soldiers trained and prepared to fight wars  There was an important second lesson  too  Enemies constantly learn lessons from reverses  and find ways to overcome barriers  The most fundamental problem with the Gaza fence and others like it is that there is no clear metric for judging just how well it works Also read  Student protests over Israel Palestine in Western colleges is seeing a corrosion of correctness Five years after former US president Donald Trump’s anti immigrant wall began going up on the country’s southwestern border  the Department of Homeland Security conducted studies that give some idea of their effectiveness  The number of so called “gotaways” “the number of subjects who  after making an unlawful entry  are not turned back or apprehended”  as defined by the DHS rose from 85 505 in 2011 to 389 155 in 2021  The number of successful turnbacks  or potential migrants the DHS stopped  also rose  but far more modestly from 121 007 to 174 320 in 2021  Few statistical studies of the kind conducted by the DHS after prolonged prodding from the state auditor  Government Accountability Office have been conducted elsewhere in the world  The DHS knew how many people it was arresting  but had no estimates of how many evaded its border defences  This has made assessment of the effectiveness of fencing almost impossible Ever since the 1940s  when the United States first began fencing the southwestern border to cut back illegal immigration  little evidence had emerged that the strategy could be successful  Efforts to close the border in 1969 and 1985 came to nothing   Former president Ronald Reagan  who presided over that second closure  earlier suggested that “rather than talking about putting up a fence  why don’t we work out some recognition of our mutual problems  make it possible for them to come here legally with a work permit ” Even as Trump spent billions of dollars on the high tech wall a policy that has continued under President Joe Biden traffickers applied private sector ingenuity to circumvent the defences  The methods range from ladders and tunnels  to devices which allow four wheelers to climb over the border wall  Trafficking cartels are also using drones to probe for gaps in the movements of border patrols  Trained terrorists have little difficulty in circumventing obstacles that don’t deter drug traffickers or illegal immigrants  As early as 2018  arrested Lashkar e Taiba terrorist Zabiullah Saqib told Indian interrogators that it took his unit of six just 30 minutes to penetrate the coils of concertina wire piled up on the Line of Control  Large parts of the fence are also damaged by heavy snowfall each winter  creating gaps that are not repaired until the spring Learning from the experience of Israel  India needs to be ready for the prospect that terrorists will find new means to test its preparedness on the Line of Control  The jihadist resurgence in Pakistan’s northwest could  for example  lead to India confronting large groups of well trained insurgents rather than just small unit infiltration  Technology cannot substitute for the training and preparedness that allow resilience in the face of surprise  Praveen Swami is contributing editor at ThePrint  Views are personal   By Ankur BanerjeeSINGAPORE  Reuters  –     Asian stocks inched lower on Wednesday

“The market has seen the tweak to a flexible regime as clear dovish development ” said Chris Weston  head of research at Pepperstone   “Once again market players have been left frustrated by the lack of urgency shown by the BOJ  and either closed yen longs or flipped into outright yen shorts ”The sharp drop in the yen prompted a fresh warning from Japan’s top currency diplomat Masato Kanda that

to the death of three persons and injured several others   Without naming anyone  the Central Committee also condemned the comments on social media by a Union Cabinet Minister and alleged he hurled “communal slurs against Kerala and its people” without ascertaining the facts   “The Central Committee called upon the people of Kerala to rise  as they have always done  against elements that seek to disrupt Kerala’s unique and unparalleled social and communal harmony ” he said  It also expressed solidarity with Palestine  and called upon all party units to step up solidarity actions and hold

such as Michigan  Ohio and Pennsylvania  called on Biden to use his influence with Israel to broker a ceasefire by 5 p m  ET  2100 GMT  on Tuesday  In an open letter entitled “2023 Ceasefire Ultimatum ” the Muslim leaders pledged to mobilize Muslim voters to “withhold endorsement  support  or votes for any candidate who endorses the Israeli offensive against the Palestinian people ” “Your administration’s unconditional support  encompassing funding and armaments  has played a significant role in perpetuating the violence that is causing civilian casualties and has eroded trust in voters who previously put their faith in you ” the council wrote Former U S  Representative Keith Ellison  Minnesota’s attorney general and the first Muslim elected to Congress  and Representative Andre Carson of Indiana are the organization’s founding co chairs  The letter is the latest sign of growing anger and frustration in Arab and Muslim American communities about Biden’s failure to condemn Israel’s attacks on the Gaza Strip after an Oct  7 attack by Hamas militants from Gaza that Israeli officials say killed 1 400 people and took 239 hostages  Medical authorities in Gaza on Monday said 8 306 people  including 3 457 children  had been killed in Israel’s three week old air and ground onslaught  Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday he would not agree to

Sonia Gandhi wrote in a column for a leading English daily  Her column came close on the heels of Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge taking a similar line  after the party went back and forth on its stance on the issue  In her column for The Hindu  Sonia Gandhi stated that the Congress’s stand on the issue was “long standing” and “principled”  She also criticised the government’s decision to abstain from voting on a resolution moved by Jordan at the UN General Assembly calling for an “immediate” ceasefire in Gaza  “…it is to support direct negotiations for a sovereign  independent  viable and secure state of Palestine coexisting in peace with Israel  This is also the stand taken by the Ministry of External Affairs on October 12  2023 ” she wrote  Gandhi added that it is “noteworthy that a reiteration of India’s historic position on Palestine came only after Israel began its assault on Gaza”  Prime Minister Narendra Modi  she wrote  “made no mention of Palestinian rights in the initial statement expressing complete solidarity with Israel”   referring to the Prime Minister’s initial reaction to the attack by Hamas  Her take on the issue comes at a time when the Congress has been going back and forth on its stance on the ongoing hostilities between Israeli forces and Hamas  the Palestinian militant outfit in control of Gaza since 2006  Initially  Congress general secretary in charge for communications Jairam Ramesh condemned the “brutal attack” on Israeli civilians while also reiterating the party’s support for the legitimate rights of Palestinians to live a life of dignity and under an elected government of their own  Thereafter  a resolution of the Congress Working Committee  CWC   the highest decision making body of the party  found no mention of the word ‘Israel’  Instead  it expressed anguish over the war and reiterated the party’s support for the rights of the Palestinian people This was after a section of leaders raised objections to Ramesh’s statement  stating that it did not reflect the Congress’s historic position on the issue  However  this was followed by a statement by party president Mallikarjun Kharge in which he took a line that was similar to the one taken by Sonia Gandhi  “The world was diminished by the brutal attacks on Israel  the world stands diminished again by Israel’s disproportionate and equally brutal response ” Sonia Gandhi wrote  She added  “The Israeli government is making a grievous error in equating the actions of Hamas with the Palestinian people  In its determination to destroy Hamas  it has unleashed

her party is “strongly opposed” to India’s abstention on the recent UN resolution which called for humanitarian truce amid unfolding crisis in Gaza amid massive Israeli military attack on the tiny territory  Government sources have said the absence of any mention of the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas terrorists in the resolution was the reason for India’s abstention as there can be no

activity Hitting back at the Congress  Trivedi told a press conference that there can be no politics on terrorism and international issues  There should be no scope for ifs and buts on terrorism and India’s stand should be clear  categorical and unequivocal  he said  When was the last time the senior most Congress leader wrote on an international conflict  he asked  “It is sad that the Congress policy is not in line with India’s prestige and dignity but is inspired by petty vote bank politics  Whatever the Congress is doing is against India’s policy ” he claimed   Even indirect support to

Reuters  –     The Palestinian group Hamas launched a surprise attack from Gaza into Israel on Oct  7  triggering an Israel Hamas war that marked the most serious escalation in the Israeli Palestinian conflict in many years  WHAT IS HAMAS  Hamas  an acronym of an Arabic phrase meaning Islamic Resistance Movement  was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian Intifada  or uprising  It was created by the Muslim Brotherhood  an Islamist organisation established in Egypt in the 1920s  It is designated as a terrorist group by Israel  the United States  European Union  Canada  Egypt and Japan WHAT DOES HAMAS WANT TO ACHIEVE  Hamas wants all the land between the Mediterranean Sea and the River Jordan  which includes the modern state of Israel as well as the occupied West Bank and Gaza  It refuses to recognise Israel  and violently opposed the Oslo peace accords negotiated by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization  PLO  in the mid 1990s  Hamas’s 1988 founding charter called for the destruction of Israel  although Hamas leaders have at times offered a long term truce  or Hudna in Arabic  with Israel in return for a viable Palestinian state on all Palestinian territory occupied by Israel in the 1967 war  Israel regards this as a ruse  HOW DID HAMAS COME TO POWER Hamas has run the Gaza Strip since 2007  after a brief civil war with forces loyal to the Fatah movement led by President Mahmoud Abbas  who is based in the West Bank and heads the more secular PLO  The Hamas takeover of Gaza followed its win in Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006 – the last time they were held  Hamas accused Abbas of conspiring against it  Abbas described what happened as a coup  Since then  there have been numerous rounds of conflict with Israel  often involving Hamas rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel and Israeli airstrikes and bombardment of Gaza  WHO ARE THE HAMAS MILITANTS Hamas has an armed wing called the Izz el Deen al Qassam Brigades  which has sent gunmen and suicide bombers into Israel and fired thousands of rockets and mortar shells  Hamas characterizes its armed activities as resistance against Israeli occupation  Hamas’s military wing is highly secretive and is run by Mohammed Deif  who masterminded the Oct  7 attack on Israel  It has bases all over Gaza  but also members across the Israeli occupied West Bank and farther afield  Many of its leaders and fighters are now thought to be concealed in a huge underground network of tunnels beneath Gaza awaiting Israel’s assault by ground forces  WHO IS FUNDING HAMAS  Although a Sunni Muslim group  Hamas is part of a regional alliance comprising Iran  Syria and the Shi’ite Islamist group Hezbollah in Lebanon  which all broadly oppose U S  policy in the Middle East and Israel  It has received money  weapons and training from Iran  but also has a fund raising network around the globe While its power base is in Gaza  Hamas also has supporters across the Palestinian territories  and it has leaders spread across the Middle East in countries including Qatar    Compiled by Tom Perry  Edited by Stephen Farrell and Nick Macfie   Kathmandu  Nepal   November 1  ANI   United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday said that he is “deeply alarmed” by the intensification of the conflict between Israel and Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups in Gaza  He asserted that “international humanitarian law is not an a la carte menu and cannot be applied selectively ”  “International humanitarian law establishes clear rules that cannot be ignored  It is not an a la carte menu and cannot be applied selectively  All parties must abide by it  including the principles of distinction  proportionality  and precaution ” Guterres said in a statement   He reiterated his call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and humanitarian access to be granted consistently to meet the urgent needs created by the catastrophe unfolding in Gaza  Guterres urged all leaders to exercise the utmost restraint to avoid a “wider conflagration ”  He noted that people have borne the brunt of the current fighting from the outset  He called the protection of civilians on both sides “paramount” and stressed that it must be respected at all times   “I am deeply alarmed by the intensification of the conflict between Israel and Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups in Gaza  This includes the expansion of ground operations by the Israel Defense Forces  accompanied by intense air strikes  and the continued rocket fire towards Israel from Gaza ” Guterres said in a statement    He condemned Hamas’s terror attacks on Israel on October 7  He called for the immediate and unconditional release of those civilians held hostage by Hamas  He condemned the killing of civilians in Gaza and stated that he is “dismayed” by reports that two thirds of those who have been killed are women and children  Guterres expressed concern over the level of humanitarian assistance that has been allowed into Gaza up to this point  describing it as “completely inadequate” and not commensurate with the needs of people in Gaza  compounding the humanitarian tragedy ” He mourned and honoured the UN colleagues who had been killed in the bombardment of Gaza    Taking to X  Guterres stated  “I am deeply alarmed by the intensification of the conflict between Israel and Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups in Gaza  With too many Israeli and Palestinian lives already lost  this escalation only increases the immense suffering of civilians ” Amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas  the Israel Defence Forces  IDF  said ground troops took control of a Hamas “military stronghold” in the northern region of the Gaza Strip and killed some 50 terrorists during operations on Tuesday  The Times of Israel reported    According to the IDF  infantry forces and tanks  led by the Givati Brigade  seized the compound in western Jabaliya  The IDF said that the compound was used by Hamas’s Jabaliya Battalion  According to the IDF  the complex includes tunnels  rocket launch positions and weapon storage sites  The Times of Israel reported   The IDF said soldiers clashed with Hamas in the compound  killing “numerous” terrorists  according to The Times of Israel report  Furthermore  the Israeli Air Force struck sites and other operatives in the area  After taking control of the site  soldiers located and destroyed the entrances to tunnels and weapons  The Israel Defence Forces said that the intelligence information was also obtained from the compound   ANI     New Delhi  “The Government of Bharat has taken a clear stand in favour of Israel and against the terrorism of Hamas ” read an editorial in Sangh mouthpiece Organiser  While elaborating on the ‘root cause’ of the Israel Palestine conflict  the piece by editor Prafulla Ketkar went on to quote Vivekananda to say that “Jews and Christians are at worst men of little faith ‘for the Islamists’  but the Hindu is idolatrous  the hateful Kaffir ” Presenting the entire conflict merely as one involving a territorial claim  he wrote  is a “grave blunder the ‘secular’ academicians and intellectuals are perpetuating”  He added that the history of Jewish persecution throughout Europe is well documented  with India being an “honourable exception”  “The monotheistic religions that originated from the Abrahamic tribe  following Jacob  Jesus and then Mohammed  cannot coexist because the supremacist and exclusivist theological interpretation is the root cause of the problem ” read the editorial dated 16 October   Ketkar wrote that “Islamists cannot accept the original territorial claim of Jews  hence the hatred”  He then referred to the normalisation of Israel’s ties with the UAE and to some extent  Saudi Arabia  to say that this “reformist path” is “unacceptable to the Islamists” of which “worldwide protest in the name of Islamic Brotherhood is a reflection” The editorial also said India’s stand “in favour of Israel” upset some elements within the country and that this must serve as caution as a “group of Islamists  supported by terror apologist politicians and communist intellectuals  would vitiate the atmosphere in Bharat”   In addition to quoting Vivekananda  Ketkar cited Ambedkar’s “book on Pakistan” to write that  for Islamists  “a country ruled by Kaffir is Dar ul Harb  house of war ”  The editorial concluded by saying that the Israel Hamas war is an “opportunity to go beyond territorial claims and understand and address the theological roots of terrorism”

victims are ordinary Muslims  whether in Gaza or elsewhere in Syria  Iraq  Iran  Pakistan  and Afghanistan ” he wrote  Jayswal also compared the attack by Hamas to other attacks carried out against India and other countries in the past  “The attack on the Israelis is not the first attack on humanity  Bharat has experienced multiple such attacks in the past  including the Kashmiri Pandit genocide in 1990  the Moplah massacre in 1921  and many more atrocities  The recent inhuman measures in Afghanistan are obvious indicators to people who have questioned such inhuman actions in the past when digital and social media were not active ” he added According to him  such “horrible crimes are still carried out by religious extremists  communist pseudo secularist  sic  gangs  enemies of humanity who pose as guardians of humanity”  “Communism and urban naxalism are attempting to destabilise the country and undermine its strong cultural base  However  if we go back in history  we can see that all of these selfish techniques have resulted in disaster and the annihilation of humanity ” Jayswal wrote  The Israel Hamas conflict was also the subject of an editorial in Panchjanya  the Sangh’s Hindi mouthpiece  In the piece  editor Hitesh Shankar compared the Hamas attack to atrocities committed in Kashmir   an apparent reference to the Kashmiri Pandit exodus  “It must be said that the gruesomeness and brutality that was shown to the women and children of Israel was nothing that India had not faced time and again  and most recently in Kashmir  But perhaps an even bigger tragedy was that the way India gradually returned to its normal rhythm after all the storms  was considered as India’s natural weakness  The sad thing is that little to no effort was made to understand this pain of India  Far from apologising for its heinousness and brutality  a class has been seen which boasts of the same till today ” read the editorial dated 15 October Shankar went on to write that many around the world have expressed their support for Hamas  citing the example of Pakistani cricketer Muhammad Rizwan who in a post on X dedicated his team’s victory over Sri Lanka in the ongoing World Cup to people in Gaza  He wrote  “…Despite being a guest  he  Rizwan  tried to send a message by praying at the ground in Hyderabad  What was the message  And who was it for ” Writing about India’s ranking in the Global Hunger Index  Ashwani Mahajan   national co convenor of RSS affiliate Swadeshi Jagran Manch   questioned the methodology employed by German private aid agency Welthungerhilfe  which compiles the annual index along with international NGO Concern Worldwide  This time around  India was ranked 111th out of 125 countries in the index   as against its 107th rank the previous year  “While the figures published by the Government of India were showing the infant mortality rate as 28 per thousand in the year 2020  international agencies are putting it at 29 84 based on their old estimates  It is noteworthy that no foreign or Indian agency is allowed to use any data other than the data published by the government ” wrote Mahajan He added that this hunger index report  however  “openly says” that it does not necessarily rely only on data provided by various government agencies  “The rapidly improving conditions in India may not be pleasing the organisations working with nefarious agendas ” Mahajan added that if the “correct data” were taken into consideration  India would be ranked ‘48th and not 111th’  Terming the “complete eradication of Maoist thought” as necessary  an editorial in Hindu Vishwa  fortnightly magazine of the Vishva Hindu Parishad  VHP   criticised journalists protesting the Delhi Police and ED’s action against NewsClick and its employees  “As the Indian government is tightening its grip on China inspired terrorist Naxalites  anti India journalists are making shameful statements calling this action anti journalist  This is not the first time that urban Maoists have been arrested  Even before this  more than 20 high level urban Maoists had been arrested ” read the editorial It went on to say that “Maoists are no less than demons working in disguise”   “Sometimes they start taking the guise of Bhagat Singh  and sometimes they start running organisations like Kabir Kala Manch under the guise of Kabir  Maoists captured the political party Forward Bloc formed by Subhas Chandra Bose  then captured the PUCLDR  People’s Union for Civil Liberties  formed against corruption by Jayaprakash Narayan and registered it in the name of PUCL  People’s Union for Civil Liberties   These days  they are seen advocating for terrorists under the guise of human rights organisations ” it added   Opposition to Hamas and support for Israel should not be seen as interference in the Israel Palestine conflict but as a “measure to protect humanity against terrorism ” read an editorial published in Rashtriya Chhatra Shakti  the monthly magazine of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad  ABVP   student wing of the RSS  “Even after two World Wars  the West’s thirst for war has not been quenched and once again the battlefield is visible  India has never tried to destroy any civilisation and will never do so as long as India lives with its values  It is beyond reason that this is not India’s struggle  yet this struggle continues on Indian soil in the form of a shadow war ” it added  Terming Western countries’ support for Israel as “natural”  the author wrote that the “brutality with which Hamas attacked and brutally killed innocent civilians  even the elderly  women and children  will be condemned by every sane person”   The attack  it said  falls in the category of the “most heinous form of global terrorism  which needs not only to be condemned but also to be swiftly countered”   The editorial then adds that it is a “matter of concern that the political opposition in India is hesitant in coming out openly in favour of the national policy even on this sensitive issue”   “Being the flag bearers of the heritage of noble thought like Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam  it is the responsibility of every Indian

majority in 2020 to just 17%  a new poll shows  amid growing anger over the Democratic president’s support for Israel’s attacks on Gaza  Arab American support for Biden  at 59% in 2020  fell even before the outbreak of violence in the Middle East to 35%  the poll commissioned by the Arab American Institute showed  but has halved since   The poll  released Tuesday  marks the first time since its inception in 1997 that a majority of Arab Americans did not identify as Democrats – 32% now identify as Republicans and 31% as independents  Forty percent of those polled said they would vote for former President Donald Trump  the likely Republican candidate in 2024  up 5 percentage points from 2020  THE TAKEThe poll is the latest evidence that Biden’s campaign for a second term in office is rapidly losing Muslim and Arab Americans support over his staunch support of Israel  These voters have traditionally voted for Democratic candidates and are prominent in hotly contested states like Michigan  Ohio and Pennsylvania  that could decide the 2024 presidential election  KEY FINDINGS A \tquarter of Arab Americans said they were unsure whom they would support in 2024  13 7% said they would back Robert F  Kennedy Jr   and 3 8% are backing Cornel West  Only 20% of Arab Americans would rate Biden’s job performance as “good ” the poll showed  with 66% reporting a negative view of the president overall Sixty eight percent of Arab Americans believed the United States should not send weapons and military equipment to Israel and believed the U S  should use its influence with Israel to call for a ceasefire  it said  Majorities are concerned about rising antisemitism  67%  and anti Arab bigotry  78%   and 59% report experiencing discrimination  a jump of 6% since the last poll in April  The poll showed that 45% of Arab Americans were concerned about their personal safety due to the recent violence in Israel and Palestine  CONTEXTMany Arab and Muslim Americans say they feel betrayed by Biden’s financial  political and military support for Israel’s attacks on the Gaza Strip after an Oct  7 attack by Hamas militants that Israeli officials say killed 1 400 people and took 239 hostages  Medical authorities in Gaza on Tuesday said 8 525 people  including 3 542 children  had been killed in Israel’s three week old air and ground onslaught  The poll was conducted by John

deeply flawed  On being asked about India’s abstention in the UN vote as it did not condemn the Hamas attacks  Netanyahu responded by saying  “I think that resolution was deeply flawed and I am sorry to say that even many of our friends did not even… insist that there could be a flaw or a powerful condemnation of the horrors that were committed here…that there are horrors that no civilised country  including your country and so many others would tolerate…” “…So I hope we don’t see a repeat of any of these kinds of resolutions ” he added  Netanyahu also made it clear that Israel would not agree to a ceasefire  drawing parallels to the United States’ position after the bombing of Pearl Harbor  He noted that calls for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas Netanyahu said  “I want to make clear Israel’s position regarding the ceasefire  Just as the United States would not agree to a ceasefire after the bombing of Pearl Harbor  or after the terrorist attacks of 9 11  Israel will not agree to a cessation of hostilities after the horrific attacks of October 7 ” “Calls for a ceasefire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas  to surrender to terror  to surrender to barbarism  That will not happen  Ladies and gentlemen  the Bible says that there is a time for peace and a time for war  This is a time for war  A war for a common future ” he said during the press briefing  India abstained from voting on the Jordanian resolution which called for an “immediate  durable and sustained humanitarian truce” between Israeli forces and Hamas terrorists in Gaza as it did not specifically condemn the terror attack by Hamas  However  it is pertinent to note that India was in favour of the Canadian resolution which had an added clause that condemned the terrorist attacks by Hamas The Jordanian led draft resolution was adopted by the General Assembly  with 120 votes in favour  14 against and 45 abstentions  The 45 nations that abstained from voting on the resolution included Iceland  India  Panama  Lithuania and Greece  The resolution was adopted during the UN General Assembly’s emergency special session on the Israel Palestine crisis  The UNGA also demanded “continuous  sufficient and unhindered” provision of lifesaving supplies and services for civilians trapped inside the enclave  Notably  expressing deep concerns over

Emphasising that differences and disputes should be resolved through dialogue  Patel said  “In a world where differences and disputes should be resolved by dialogue  this august body should be deeply concerned at recourse to violence  That too  when it happens on a scale and intensity that is an affront to basic human values  Violence as a means to achieve political objectives damages indiscriminately and does not pave the way for any durable solutions ”  The adoption of the Jordanian resolution is the first formal response of the United Nations to the escalation of violence in Israel and Palestine since the Hamas terror attacks of 7 October   The voting at UNGA comes at a time when Israel has announced expanding ground operations in Gaza   ANI   By Emma Farge and Aidan Lewis Reuters  –     Distribution of food and medical supplies is faltering in Gaza due to a chronic lack of fuel  looting of stores  the choking of streets with rubble from Israeli shelling and overcrowding caused by displacement of civilians  And despite an uptick in the trickle of supplies  the number of aid trucks entering Gaza   currently averaging 14 daily   remains tiny compared to the 400 trucks seen daily in normal times for a population of 2 3 million now desperate for essentials like bread  aid officials say  U N  Palestinian refugee agency  UNRWA  said on Monday that over the past day it had delivered hundreds of tonnes of flour to 50 Gaza bakeries  helping to lower bread prices by half  and to shelters hosting hundreds of thousands of people  But the agency  which runs Gaza’s largest aid operation  said a break in by hungry Gazans on Sunday at its second largest warehouse was likely to further complicate its work A logistics base at the Rafah border crossing that is vital to aid distribution has become harder to operate because 8 000 displaced people are sheltering at it  The agency has also seen 67 of its workers killed in Gaza since Oct  7  the highest number of UN staff killed in any conflict in such a short span of time  it said   UNRWA spokesperson Juliette Touma said the agency’s priority was providing aid to 150 shelters for at least 670 000 displaced people  while another priority was providing wheat flour to bakeries  “We’re way beyond our capacity” to do anything more than that  she added The number of displaced is four times more than UNRWA had planned for before the war as a worst case scenario  she said  The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said their Gaza City warehouses had suffered “severe damage” on Monday and were out of service  Israel is blockading Gaza and refuses to allow in fuel  saying it could be used by the Hamas militant group for their military goals   “The constant threat of bombardment  debris  and lack of fuel makes roads extremely dangerous and inaccessible in many parts of the Gaza Strip ” said Jonathan Crickx  communications chief for UNICEF Palestine While UNICEF is bringing in medical supplies  he said  “distribution is becoming more and more difficult”   SANITATION ‘ATROCIOUS’ Aid flows to Gaza have fallen sharply since Israel started shelling the Palestinian enclave in response to an attack by the Hamas militant group on Oct  7 that killed 1 400 people  The death toll from the bombardment has caused international uproar  Medical authorities in Hamas run Gaza said on Tuesday that 8 525 people including 3 542 minors had been killed Distribution is particularly hard in northern Gaza  the main focus of Israel’s military operation  aid officials say  and some have halted all deliveries   World Health Organization  WHO  spokesperson Christian Lindmeier said on Tuesday it had sent no further aid to northern Gaza hospitals since Oct  24  citing a lack of security guarantees  A public health catastrophe is imminent  he said  amid the mass displacement and damage to water and sanitation infrastructure  He said there had been 82 attacks on healthcare facilities in Gaza since the conflict began on Oct  7  with 491 people killed in the attacks  including 16 on duty health workers  and 28 ambulances damaged or destroyed  Rick Brennan  the WHO regional emergencies director  told Reuters that with 1 4 million people displaced in such a densely populated territory  conditions were dire  “The sanitation is atrocious  I mean I was just talking to an UNRWA colleague  she said the living conditions are sub human  Where do people go to the bathroom  How do you remove all waste ” He said such a condition was ripe for the outbreak of  diseases such as diarrhoea and respiratory and skin infections such as scabies  In Cairo  U S  Special Envoy David Satterfield  who has been negotiating with Israel and Egypt over aid deliveries  said providing humanitarian aid was critically important for Gaza  whose inhabitants say food and water have almost run out “This is a society on edge and desperate… and the U N  implementers must be able to demonstrate that aid is not episodic ” he said in a briefing for reporters  Aid flows from Egypt have been slowed by an inspection system agreed with Israel in which trucks drive from Egypt’s Rafah crossing along the Egypt Israel border before returning towards Gaza  UNRWA’s Touma called the system “way too cumbersome”    Additional reporting by Gabrielle Tetrault Farber  Editing by William

for devastated communities of traumatised people from the south  including children who have been orphaned and dispersed throughout 29 regional councils  according to a senior Israeli military official   The official said that it took more than two weeks to identify some of the victims of the October 7 mass murder attack launched by Hamas death squads  including a mother burned to death in Kibbutz Kfar Aza after her home was burned down and her husband killed  “Kfar Aza was a living place  no one locked the doors there  and bicycles were all over  Three days ago in Kfar Aza  we were examining a house that was totally burned  The husband was declared dead  and his wife was declared missing  We searched the house several times  nothing was found   He added that a group of archaeologists were then brought to the home  “In the reinforced room  there was a pile of ashes next to a wooden cabin  no one paid attention to it  But upon further inspection  a jaw was found among the ashes  It was her  The wife was then declared dead  more than two weeks after the attack ” the official recalled   Temporary graves have been created in the south  The level of evil unleashed on Israeli civilians is “beyond anything we imagined ” the official said   “Sha’ar HaNegev Regional Council’s civilians are now divided into 29 regional councils around Israel  There is a need to take care of orphans who lost both parents  These people have been evacuated around the country ” he stated  Founded in 1992  the Israel Defense Forces Home Front Command was established as a lesson of the 1991 Gulf War based on the realization that wars are changing and that missile attacks targeting the Israeli civilian population indiscriminately would become the new threat   Should Hezbollah enter the war in a full scale manner  it could fire some 1 000 projectiles at central Israel a day  and more than 10 000 a day at the north for a period of time  according to some assessments  “We already face a very significant fire on our civilians like we’ve never seen before  On the other hand  I think we are now protecting the populated areas of Israel in a good way  The threat is significant ” said the source   He cautioned against being deceived by the semi routine on display in places like Tel Aviv  warning that the Iron Dome air defence system is not hermetic and that the threat of terrorism in central Israel has not vanished either  The IDF has been working for a lengthy period of time to secure factories and sites with hazardous materials   The Home Front Command has also been working with Bedouin communities in the south to improve early warning and protection for them against rocket threats  At present  Israel is divided into almost 2 000 alert areas  This precision prevents unnecessary evacuation to safe rooms–enabling more of the country to take part in keeping the economy going and caring for their basic needs   “We had significant numbers of direct hits that we never had before on buildings in Israel during this war ” said the source  “These are unguided projectiles fired at cities  towns and villages  Hamas does not care where they hit ” The Home Front Command has permanent liaison units in every local authority  training local council representatives during wartime and activating them during wars  It also divided the country into four guideline levels–red  signifying a restricted activity  orange  meaning limited activity  yellow for partial activity  and green  for full activity   Nevertheless  many parents are fearful of sending their children to school in areas where schools are allowed to open  So far  the average number of rockets fired per day at Israeli civilians during the “Operation Swords of Iron” war is more than 500–the highest of any past conflict  In the southern part of Ashkelon  rocket alerts go off every three hours   The head of the Home Front Command’s Dan District  Colonel Hai Rekah  said a national centre of 300 hotels for those displaced by war is in action  including 100 hotels in central Israel  “Many there are in mourning for their loved ones  Now what we are doing is placing many soldiers in the hotels to support these communities ” he said   Meanwhile  the Command’s Family Casualty Center notifies people about the fate of their loved ones  The Home Front Command opened a national centre to facilitate this  together with police and local authority representatives and has so far notified more than 800 families   “Identifying the casualties was very hard  We have more than 100 families  left  to notify after finishing the identification process ” said Rekah  He recalled being told by one family that their son was kidnapped  not killed and told to leave and then having to come back with a photograph to establish that he had indeed been killed  “I just showed the picture to the sister  She saw only the hand  and the bracelet and knew this was the brother  Only after that  they believed he had been killed ” he said   He added grimly that “many families were killed totally  and the problem was of who to notify ” As for the war in full force  ultimately  he said  “We are ready  The IDF is strong  Israel is strong  In the end  we are going to beat Hamas  Despite the fact that we are in complicated days  in the end we are going to win ”  ANI TPS    Kolkata  Nov 1  PTI  Four

Israel on October 7  according to a CNN report   Earlier  the IDF spokesperson Lt Colonel Richard Hecht said that the IDF was targeting “a very senior Hamas commander” in the area around the camp  In

defence systems from Washington reflects its growing concern about being caught in the crossfire if the war in Gaza pulls in Iran and its well armed regional militias on the kingdom’s borders  Jordan neighbours Syria and Iraq – both states where Iranian proxies operate – and also sits next door to Israel and the Israeli occupied West Bank  It has watched Israel’s war against the Palestinian group Hamas  another Iranian ally  with rising alarm  King Abdullah has spoken bluntly about his fears that the conflict could cause trigger a new displacement of Palestinians to the kingdom  already home to a large population of Palestinians dispossessed from their land when Israel was created in 1948  But former senior Jordanian officials and a security source told Reuters that Jordan was now appealing for more advanced U S  defence hardware and support because of worries Iran and its proxies could become embroiled more deeply in any wider Middle East conflagration “Jordan needs these weapons to protect itself  but it is also in the U S  interest  and it is a key deterrence to the Iranians ” said Mamoun Abu Nuwar  a former Jordanian air force general  “With the presence of these unruly  uncontrolled militias  let’s say that if they start striking Israel in a widening conflict  we would be caught in the middle ” he said  A Jordanian army spokesperson said on Sunday that Amman had requested that U S  Patriot missiles be deployed in Jordan  Washington last stationed the air defence system in Jordan in 2013 when an escalating conflict in Syria had also raised fears of a regional flare up that could threaten the country   one of Washington’s most loyal Middle East allies Jordan’s announcement of the Patriot request comes as Amman has been deepening its defence ties with Washington  It already has a list of U S  equipment on order for its military  including 12 U S  built F 16 warplanes  “I expect we will see a much more accelerated response to longstanding requests for a whole inventory of munitions and equipment that had been relatively slow to be delivered ” said a security official in Jordan  who declined to be named  BOLSTERING DEFENCES A spokesperson for the U S  Embassy in Amman did not have more details about the Patriot request  They said Washington was working with F 16’s manufacturer on delivering the plane order and said U S  military assistance to Jordan was worth more than $600 million a year The U S  military said on Oct  21 it would send a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense  THAAD  system and Patriots to the Middle East – without saying precisely where they would be located – in response to attacks on U S  troops in the region  The Pentagon has declined to say whether the Patriot system will be deployed in Jordan  Jordan’s government signed a defence deal with the United States in January 2021  offering U S  forces “unimpeded access” to several Jordanian military facilities  storage sites for prepositioning equipment and other installations  The U S  military has also been training Jordan’s army “On the issue of our borders with Syria  bolstering our defence is in tune with U S  interests in the region where there has been a building up of capabilities of the Jordanian army ” said Samih Al Maitah  a former information minister  Maitah  who has a close knowledge of Jordan’s security and political thinking  said Amman needed support to defend itself against Iranian backed militias building up their strength on Jordan’s borders with Iraq and Syria  He said Jordan’s military and security forces were determined “to prevent any party in these Iranian militias from exploiting the Gaza war to achieve a security breakthrough”  GROWING IRANIAN INFLUENCEIran’s influence in Jordan’s neighbours has grown in the past two decades  The U S  led invasion of Iraq in 2003  which toppled Sunni Muslim autocrat Saddam Hussein  allowed Shi’ite Muslim Iran to expand its influence there  Since the Gaza war erupted  Iranian backed militias have  attacked U S  forces in Iraq  including a drone attack on Iraq’s Ain al Asad airbase on Tuesday  Iran’s influence in Syria has expanded since Tehran’s allies  including Lebanese group Hezbollah  helped Syrian President Bashar al Assad quell a rebellion that erupted in 2011  Iranian backed militias hold sway on Syria’s southern border with Jordan and Amman blames them and Iran for running a thriving drugs smuggling business  Adding to the mix  Yemen’s Iran backed Houthi group said on Tuesday it had fired missiles at Israel on several occasions in October  including Tuesday when Israel said it downed an “aerial target” in the area of the Red Sea city of Eilat  which is located next to Jordan’s border and its city of Aqaba “Getting the Patriots is now pressing in light of the escalation by Iranian proxies that are incrementally stepping up their drone attacks and firing rockets from Syria  Iraq and Yemen ” said Saud Al Sharafat

Saturday  Communist Party of India  Marxist  General Secretary Sitaram Yechury and CPI General Secretary D Raja said in the statement   titled Stop this Genocidal Aggression in Gaza   that India’s

truce titled ‘Protection of civilians and upholding legal and humanitarian obligations’ in the ongoing Israeli offensive in Gaza ” they said   “India’s abstention on a resolution that was overwhelmingly adopted shows the extent to which Indian foreign policy is being shaped by being a subordinate ally of US imperialism and the Modi government’s actions for consolidating the US  Israel

up its “genocidal air and ground attacks in the Gaza strip ” It has also cut off all communications in Gaza which is home to 2 2 million Palestinians  they said  calling for an immediate ceasefire

looks forward to a robust and productive COP28 ” a spokesperson said  Biden aides are balancing demands for the president’s time amid a Middle East war and a showdown with a Republican controlled House of Representatives over federal spending  as well as ahead of a presidential campaign season that aides expect to heat up in January  Dozens of countries plan to push for the world’s first deal to phase out CO2 emitting coal  oil and gas at the Dubai meeting  Such a deal would be a feather in the Democratic president’s cap ahead of a 2024 presidential election where many liberal and younger voters rank climate change as a top issue The event would also allow Biden a chance to connect in person with Arab and other world leaders to discuss the war in Gaza after a planned summit this month

tensions rise  global divisions are becoming deeper and more dangerous  and “smaller countries fear becoming collateral damage in competition between great powers”   Guterres made these remarks during his address to Nepal’s parliament   The United Nations Secretary General also spoke on the ongoing conflict in the Middle East  acknowledging that despite being thousands of miles away  Nepali citizens were among the victims of Hamas’ brutal attacks in Israel   He extended his condolences to the families of the 10 Nepalese students who lost their lives during an attack by Hamas militants in Israel and expressed his best wishes for the safe return of Bipin Joshi  a student who is currently missing  “As geopolitical tensions rise  global divisions are becoming deeper and more dangerous  Smaller countries fear becoming collateral damage in competition between great powers ” Guterres said   Lauding Nepal’s peace process  the General Secretary said  “Your country has successfully calmed the storms of conflict and moved from war to peace  A process the United Nations has been proud to support”   “This small country has made an outsized contribution to international peace…you are preparing the final stages of your peace process – healing the wounds of war through transitional justice  A process that must help to bring peace to victims  families and communities haunted by questions  and scarred by injustice  and help put the past to rest ” he noted   The UN chief underscored the need to implement the transitional justice mechanism saying  “Transitional justice can play a vital role in securing lasting peace ” Over 17 000 people were killed and thousands were displaced  mostly throughout rural Nepal  during the armed Maoist movement in Nepal that lasted from 1996 to 2006  The conflict began on February 1996  when the CPN  Maoist  initiated an insurgency to overthrow the Nepali monarchy and establish a people’s republic  The revolution ended with the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Accord on November 2006   Emphasising Nepal’s commitment to global peace and security  Guterres pointed out that the Himalayan nation is the second largest contributor of troops to United Nations missions worldwide   India has been the largest troop contributor to UN missions since its inception   Nepal  the UN chief said  “is a promoter of peace  a champion of multilateralism  and a staunch supporter of sustainable development and climate action”  Underlining the disastrous impact of global warming  Guterres said  “Glaciers are melting at records…The effect is devastating  Swollen lakes bursting  rivers and seas rising  cultures threatened  And mountain sides exposed  inflaming the risk of rock slides  landslides and avalanche ” He said the world must act now to protect people on the frontline and to limit global temperature rise to 1 5 degrees Celsius  The UN chief also appealed to the international community to donate funding to help build resilience in effected communities   As climate catastrophe is accelerating with a deadly force  the world could learn much from Nepal in responding to these crises  Guterres said   He also recognised Nepal’s unique position  nestled between two major powers  India and China   and commended the nation for forging its own path to safeguard sovereignty and independence   Guterres also underscored the need for reform in the United Nations  including the Security Council  “Developing countries must have far greater representation in international institutions ” he said  adding  “I have called for reform of the outdated United Nations Security Council ” Guterres said he “has proposed measures to reform the global financial architecture – so that it better represents developing countries and responds to their needs”   He expressed the UN’s commitment to support Nepal’s graduation from Least Developed Country  LDC  status  underlining that this transition is imminent   During his visit to

women died and 51 persons were injured  some seriously  in multiple blasts at a Christian religious gathering in a convention centre near this port city on Sunday morning  sending shockwaves across Kerala  The blasts took place at an international convention centre in Kalamassery where hundreds of followers of the minority Christian group Jehovah’s Witnesses had assembled on the concluding day of a three day long prayer meeting  A few hours after the incident  a man claiming to be a member of Jehovah’s Witnesses  surrendered before police in Thrissur district of the state  saying that he carried out the multiple blasts  Police has registered an FIR against unknown persons under Sections 302  murder  and 307  attempt to murder  of the IPC as well as provisions of the Explosives Act and the anti terror law Unlawful Activities  Prevention  Act  UAPA  Later in the day  state Health Minister Veena George said that of the 51 injured  30 were admitted in various hospitals in the state and of them 18 were in ICUs  Of the 18  six   including a 12 year old child   were in critical condition with three of them having suffered over 90 per cent burns  the minister said  She said teams of plastic surgeons and general surgeons arrived at Kalamassery Medical College from Thrissur and Kottayam medical colleges  Besides that a 14 member medical board was also constituted to supervise the treatment being provided to the injured  ADGP Law and Order M R Ajith Kumar told reporters here that a man named Dominic Martin had surrendered at Kodakara police station in the morning  claiming he was the one who set off the blasts The officer said the man gave evidence supporting his claim and the police were examining that as well as his claims and the reasons he gave for carrying out the act  Prior to surrendering before the police  the man also put out a video message on a social media platform claiming responsibility for the blasts and stating his reasons  In the video  which was aired on various TV channels  the man claimed that he took the decision as the teachings of the organisation were “seditious ” No one from the organisation has reacted to his allegations  Meanwhile  a person claiming to be a member of the religious group told a TV channel that no such person was part of their organisation presently Martin further claimed that Jehovah’s Witnesses and its ideology were dangerous for the country and therefore its presence had to be ended in the state  He claimed that he had told the organisation several times to correct its teachings  but it was not ready to do so  “As I had no other option  I took this decision ” the man said  Earlier  State Police Chief Shaik Darvesh Saheb told reporters in Thiruvananthapuram that according to the preliminary probe  an improvised explosive device  IED  was used to carry out the blasts  Jehovah’s Witnesses is a Christian religious group that originated in the United States of America in the 19th century “This morning at 9 40 am approximately  there was an explosion in Zamrah International Convention Centre in Kalamassery in which one person died and 36 people are undergoing treatment as per our information ” the DGP said  “We are examining it ” he said  adding that a Special Investigation Team  SIT  will be constituted once he reaches the site  A police source told PTI that there were three blasts  of which two were strong and the third was of low intensity  On being asked whether tiffin boxes were used for packing the explosives as claimed by some news reports  the source said that it cannot be confirmed at this stage as the blast site was being examined by multiple agencies  including the state anti terrorism squad and the National Investigation Agency  NIA  Earlier  before Dominic Martin had surrendered  the DGP said he cannot say anything at this stage  and only after further investigation can he confirm whether it was an act of terror  “Only after the investigation can I confirm the details  We are examining all the angles  We will find out who is behind this and take stringent action against them ” the top police official said  He also urged people to maintain peace and remain calm and asked them not to spread provocative or hateful messages on social media  The spreading of provocative or hateful messages on social media would invite strict action  he warned The incident was termed as “shocking” by Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan and “extremely unfortunate” by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan  “Shocked to hear about the blast at a religious gathering at  Kalamassery  Ernakulam district  Kerala  killing one person and injuring over 20  “Heartfelt condolences to the kin of the deceased and prayers for speedy recovery of the injured ” the Governor said in a post on social media platform X  Speaking to reporters in Delhi earlier  before reports of the second death in the blast  Vijayan said  “It is an unfortunate incident  One person died  and two others are in serious condition  An investigation has been launched  and further details will be available later  The incident is being viewed very seriously ” The CM also convened an all party meeting on Monday in the wake of the blasts at the convention centre  CPI M  State Secretary M V Govindan  who is in Delhi along with Vijayan for some party programmes  said any terrible actions aimed at diverting attention from the Palestine issue would entail strict action “When Kerala stands united with the people of Palestine  any terrible action to divert attention from it will entail strict action  The government and all democratic persons will together condemn it ” he said  Govindan also said that on viewing the incident politically in the prevailing situation  it appears to be part of a terror act  “That needs to be examined seriously ” he said  Kerala Revenue Minister K Rajan said no one  including the media  should take any steps or circulate information based on misconceptions about the incident Eyewitnesses recounted the terrifying moments following the blasts which occurred minutes after attendees began praying with their eyes closed  Recounting her shocking experience  an elderly woman said  “When I opened my eyes after hearing the first blast  all I saw was a fireball in front of me  “Nothing…nothing more…just a fireball  Everybody ran  scattered here and there  It was a sprawling hall  and a large number of people were inside ” Among the distressed crowd at the venue were senior citizens  including women who had participated in the morning prayers  A man in his 70s  his voice trembling  described the shock of witnessing a blast in the midst of the densely populated prayer convention In all his years of attending the convention  he said  he had never witnessed anything like this before  Visuals of the incident on TV channels showed fire rescue and police personnel in large numbers evacuating the site  Disturbing visuals of the situation inside the convention centre shortly after the blasts showed multiple fires inside the hall as people and children were heard screaming in fear  The video also showed some people trying to quell the fire as the hall was littered with scattered and broken chairs  many of which were ablaze Following the blasts  police and district administrations across the state were put on alert  PTI HMP LGK TGB ANE  Gaza

Fahmy   New Delhi  Although Israel’s bombardment of Gaza and the rising Palestinian toll continued to weigh heavily on the minds of the Urdu press this week  next month’s assembly elections in five states also got significant space on its front pages and editorials   As elections in Rajasthan  Chhattisgarh  Madhya Pradesh  Mizoram  and Telangana draw near  all three prominent Urdu papers  Roznama Rashtriya Sahara  Inquilab  and Siasat  carried extensive coverage of campaigns by both the BJP and the Opposition INDIA alliance   An editorial in Inquilab offered a rare criticism of the Opposition bloc  especially in light of the fissures between the Congress and the Samajwadi Party  SP  over ticket distribution in Madhya Pradesh  Titled ‘Is INDIA still on hold ’  the editorial dated 27 October sought to warn the Opposition alliance that it was not as strong as it ought to be to counter the BJP during next year’s parliamentary election   “Its meetings are not taking place  Are all its activities secret and  if so   will they come to light after the assembly elections of five states ” the editorial asked  “Tensions have been rising  in the alliance  since its joint sessions in Patna  Bengaluru  and Mumbai  A day will come soon when even the name INDIA will disappear from the minds of the people of the country ”Other issues that received prominent coverage in the Urdu press are the debate on a nationwide caste census and former Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s return to the country   The newspapers also reported Qatar’s death sentence to eight former Indian Navy officers in a case of alleged espionage  Here’s a recap of all that made the front pages and editorials of the Urdu press this week   Also Read  Urdu press hails SC ruling on same sex marriage  says ‘unnatural practice’ needs ‘cure’In its editorial on 22 October  Siasat called the BJP’s decision to finally give A ticket to former Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje an “attempt to end internal disturbances” and maintain balance within the party  The BJP  according to this editorial  has suffered several losses at a public level and this is an attempt to recoup   Another editorial in the newspaper  dated 24 October  said the BJP’s “frustration” is causing it to create differences in the Opposition’s 26 party INDIA alliance through the “Godi media”  and praised the Congress for focusing on its election campaign “instead of paying attention to such side issues”  “Godi media” is a derogatory term that critics of the Modi government use for media organisations they perceive as being partial to the ruling dispensation   The editorial also referred to the differences between the Congress and the SP over ticket distribution   according to it  there may be “differences of opinion” between the parties  but this does not throw the alliance into a state of disarray On 25 October  Siasat’s editorial spoke about wasteful election expenditure and the use of illegally acquired money during elections  What is even more concerning  according to the article  is the public’s willingness to go along with the trend and vote for the candidate who pays more    Even public spirited individuals are not untouched by this  the editorial said  adding that whether political leaders  candidates  or the voting public  it’s everyone’s responsibility not to weaken the roots of India’s democracy  In its editorial on 25 October  Inquilab wrote about the “infighting” in the BJP’s Rajasthan unit  Until a few months ago  the party would not tire of speaking about the battle within the Congress between Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and his once deputy  Sachin Pilot  the editorial said  But now  it’s facing the same situation  it added   the party had first announced that it would not give tickets to former contenders  but now  more than 70 percent of its candidates in the state are elderly   The editorial also puts down the BJP’s decision to give a ticket to the long sidelined Raje to its “weak position” in the state  The party  according to the editorial  knows that Madhya Pradesh could slip through its fingers and is now pinning its hopes on Rajasthan  On 26 October  Siasat’s editorial took stock of election predictions  It cited election surveys to say that the BJP could face a crushing defeat in Madhya Pradesh and is making all kinds of efforts to retain power in the state while also unseating the Ashok Gehlot led government in Rajasthan  But so far  its efforts have had little success  it added   Amid apprehensions about an imminent Israeli ground invasion in Gaza and the death toll mounting in the Palestinian territories  the Urdu press continued to focus on the ongoing conflict not only in its front pages but also in its editorials    Editorials in the three prominent Urdu newspapers questioned the “world’s silence” over the rising death toll in the impoverished Gaza   The Gaza strip has been under siege since 7 October  when Hamas   the militant organistion that has controlled it since 2007   attacked Israel  The death toll in Israel’s retaliatory assault reportedly stands at over 7 000   Sahara’s editorial on 23 October questioned the West for its silence over the mounting humanitarian crisis in Gaza  The West’s support has emboldened Israel  it said  adding that  despite the loss of lives and property  no Western country is ready to come forward to demand a ceasefire   “How can one expect improvement under such circumstances ” the editorial asks   In another editorial on 24 October  Sahara analysed the US’ position in the Israel Hamas conflict  America  according to the editorial  was behaving like Hamas had attacked it and not Israel  The war has also exposed the US’ weakening position in world politics  it said  adding that it could neither hold out in Afghanistan  before the Taliban seized control of the country in 2021  nor directly confront Moscow in the Ukraine war  It added that if Israel were to launch a ground invasion in Gaza and lose its soldiers in large numbers  the US may have to get directly involved  giving countries like China and Russia a chance to take “advantage” of the situation In an editorial dated 26 October  Inquilab said that  in an ideal world  where there’s no hypocrisy  Israel would be tried and punished for war crimes  But Tel Aviv continues to break international humanitarian laws even as major world powers watch silently  it added   Also Read  Urdu dailies slam Modi govt for siding with Israel   international community’s ‘double standards’ Former Pakistan PM Sharif returned to the country last week after four years   In an editorial on 23 October  Siasat said Sharif has made it clear that his daughter Maryam Nawaz Sharif would be his successor  Pakistan  the editorial said  needs strong leadership  especially given its economic situation  It also needs to mend its ties with its neighbours   most notably India  it added  According to the editorial  Pakistan’s “political and military conflicts” have eroded its position  and without loans  it would be hard for the country to survive    “Nawaz Sharif  his family  and other political leaders must think carefully in such a situation ” the editorial said  “We  India and Pakistan  must set aside political differences and work together to create a comprehensive plan ”  In an editorial on 25 October  Sahara referred to the support for a caste based census within the BJP led National Democratic Alliance   Smaller parties like the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party  the NISHAD party  Apna Dal  Sonelal   and Hindustani Awam Morcha Secular have all voiced their support for a caste based survey  although ally BJP is still reluctant  According to the editorial  NDA constituents’ support for such a survey may worry the BJP  which has been surprisingly mute on the issue despite PM Narendra Modi’s wooing of Pasmanda Muslims   “All these things suggest Mandal like conditions for the country again  This is just the beginning  but statements suggest it will go far ” it said  “This will become a compulsion for all parties  No one can neglect the OBCs ”  Edited by

you are still an idealistic and uncorrupted teenager at your school’s Model UN debate  That’s why defence budgets are going up for all major nations  Even Japan has dumped its pacifism and released a comprehensive military upgrade plan to double its defence budget by 2027  If we  however  posit this question differently  a debate is possible  Critical and essential though the armies are for overall power  can they achieve their nation’s political objectives by themselves  Our answer won’t be an unequivocal yes  But that would be the impression if you watch much of the debate in the country  especially on our TV channels that seem to be raring for the invasion The logic is  Israel has among the world’s best armies  intelligence  and once these are unleashed  Hamas will be history  Here’s a spoiler  if military power is all it would take to finish the menace of an awful terrorist organisation like Hamas  how come five Israeli wars in Gaza since 2003 have failed to do so  And where did ISIS come from  If quick military invasion is all that was needed to finish Hamas  how come the Israelis still haven’t done so  Are they hedging  hesitant or regrouping after the first flush of anger has passed  Israel’s own experience shows better than any other nation  besides the US’s  that relying on military power  however overwhelming  is a very dodgy approach to a larger political and strategic objective  It mostly guarantees failure  not success  Specifically for Israel  its armies have played a critical role in protecting it  But it had to make an expensive peace deal with the Egyptians returning all territories captured in 1967  All its other enemies  including non state actors such as Hamas or Hezbollah  are still in the ring for a fight  and on their feet History of the past eight decades  post World War 2  teaches us that a pure military approach is almost always guaranteed to fail  There might be a couple of exceptions here and there  like India in 1971 and Britain in the Falklands War  but those are also qualified by other important factors  On the record though  Israeli leaders  especially Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  have spoken repeatedly of destroying Hamas with a finality  For that to happen  it is presumed   and widely accepted   that a ground invasion is absolutely necessary  Since the atrocity of 7 October  the only question over the ground invasion has been when  The why  how  and to what end  have mostly been missing from the debate  Of course  there are two clear sides to the larger question for the Israelis Jews and for Hamas Palestinians  A ground invasion is taken as an inevitability by both  never mind the caution that US President Joe Biden sounded on his way out of Israel  Those who believe that Netanyahu is absolutely committed to the idea think that he is only waiting for the new equipment from the US to be in place  and its western allies to build up strength in the Mediterranean to deter Iran and its proxies  Either way  since he has some breathing and thinking room now  a bit of rethink might not be out of place  It is possible that the conclusion will still finally be to “go inside”  but there is no harm doing a bit more wargaming and also history gazing Because  while almost nobody since 1945 achieved its primary national objective through military means  many have ended up suffering unlikely defeats and enfeebling themselves in the course of time  Think Soviet Union in Afghanistan  America in Afghanistan and Iraq  And before that  Vietnam and Korea  Similarly  the French military power lost all of Africa  Now  we watch a retreat of the remains of French power from several countries in Africa as the new juntas backed by the Chinese and Russian proxies take over  Niger being only the more prominent example  Also Read  In this war of dead baby pictures  yours versus mine  the question of who’s the victim will be lost The remarkable success of Israel’s military lies in the fact that Israel exists  Or a tiny strip of a nation between the “river and the sea” would’ve been overrun many times over  As for what the military has added territorially  questions remain  The annexation of Golan Heights may look somewhat more widely accepted  but serious questions will always remain on the West Bank Again  whatever the outcome of an invasion in Gaza  the global clamour for a two state solution  an independent Palestine  will only get stronger  This will include Israel’s closest friends  from the US to India  Europe has traditionally had even stronger views on this  The Chinese have taken a stronger position  especially with their deepening relationship with Iran and Russia  Israel’s latest  and most critical friends in the region  the UAE  Saudi Arabia and Bahrain will also double up for the Palestinian state  even as they go the extra mile to preserve Israel  You want to see the complexity  Check out how history was made when the Saudis used top of the line US supplied anti missile systems to shoot down a Houthi missile en route to Israel Saudis will be new and good friends because they see their strategic interests always run contrary to Iran’s and aligned with the US and Israel  But they will not run against overwhelming Arab and Muslim opinion on Palestine  Also Read  Why military is more for asserting political will  not just about controlling territory Last eight decades have repeatedly underlined the futility of settling any chronic issues using purely military means  If that was possible  India would by now have finished the Kashmir problem  Military shock and awe works initially  but the effect is a bit like that of steroid therapy  It puts down the problem in the immediate term  gives you a bit of relief  and satisfies the urge for revenge  The problem within festers  even gets stronger like a germ under steroid therapy  Israelis know it better than any other  In a war  one side may win every battle  as the Americans did in Afghanistan and Iran  But in the absence of diplomacy  politics  compromise and give and take going hand in hand  the final result is defeat  Israel’s challenge is complicated by the fact that they do not face a hostile  sovereign power  Whatever the Iranians may do behind the scenes  they are not about to participate directly in this war  Gaza itself is really a little urban sprawl  Think of it as a territory the size of Greater Noida on the outskirts of Delhi  Or about one and a half times the size of Noida  It is merely 351 square km  41 km long and between 5 and 12 km wide  You can unleash the strongest military in the middle east and declare victory  But there will be costs  As any practitioner of urban warfare will tell you   what modern armies call FIBUA  or Fighting In Built Up Areas   cities suck in and trap troops and give a determined defender as much advantage as high ground in the mountains  Does Israel want to risk that  along with civilian casualties  destruction and global censure  It may kill all of Hamas’s current leaders and most of its manpower  but the supremely evil idea and ideology won’t just survive  it will return stronger Would it be better off fighting a more patient  Israel like long war  using its legendary intelligence  targeted attacks  targeting terrorist leaders and avoiding its own casualties as well as international opprobrium  This delayed ground invasion is Netanyahu’s moment to rethink  Also Read  With Agnipath  Modi govt’s shock   awe doctrine may have misfired a vital reform  yet again  The demonstrations that sprang up in the United Kingdom after the Hamas attack on Israel shows that the response to jihadism has shifted  The last three weeks have seen the open proclamation of Islamic jihad on the UK’s streets and the intimidation of its Jewish population  This has confirmed the comfort that sections of the political Left in the UK draw from the revolutionary potential they detect in Islamic fundamentalism  It is no longer unequivocally seen as a criminal movement but one through which ‘resistance’ is being carried out  This description is seductive not only to Muslims but also to sections of the Left and supported by superficially attractive claims of decolonisation  On issues such as LGBTQ  rights  Islamic jihadism and Leftist movements are diametrically opposed  but their soldering has occurred at the focal point of the Palestine question  Together  they have taken the genie of jihad out of the bottle  The menace of Islamic fundamentalism and the criminality it espouses have not gone unnoticed since the burnings of Salman Rushdie’s Satanic Verses in the late 1980s  Iran had called for the author’s execution  Even if the extent is difficult to verify  Iran today provides support and succour to Hamas  Although now a mere footnote in history  the Iranian revolution violently eliminated the Left in that country  Also Read  Student protests over Israel Palestine in Western colleges is seeing a corrosion of correctnessIt is just over a year since Hindus in Leicester and Birmingham saw up close that jihadis can operate almost without restriction with what appeared to be the collusion of the local police authority and municipality  With a large spike in reports of antisemitic crimes  British Jews are now considering their options  It is curious that the spike in reports of Islamophobic attacks doesn’t lead to Muslims making emigration plans  It is instead accompanied by calls to jihad from mosque pulpits across the United Kingdom  reported The Jewish Chronicle  If the number of jihadis on the British Security Service watchlist  as per a Daily Mail report  was not already indicative of the jihadist problem  the scale of it has been shown in the demonstrations since the 7 October Hamas attacks  Groups of protestors have openly waved jihadist flags and shouted for the massacre of Jews  Although MI5’s director general confirms that the current national threat level remains substantial  London’s police stood by  Adding insult  the police initially announced through their social media accounts that the flags and chants of jihad were not criminal  If one treats the police claim generously one might be forgiven for concluding that the police too think that calling for jihad by Muslim armies is a legitimate expression of Islamic beliefs  The Islamic movements that now inhabit Britain’s mainstream certainly believe that  A 2018 report by the All Party Parliamentary Group on British Muslims indicates how institutionalised the rot has become  It cites as an example of Islamophobia  “Denying Muslim populations the right to self determination e g   by claiming that the existence of an independent Palestine or Kashmir is a terrorist endeavour ” How then could Hamas possibly be a terrorist organisation  The report’s definition of Islamophobia has since been adopted by many local authorities  Also Read  What  when  where  why   how of the Israel Hamas warAs with Leicester last year and London this year  we might be forgiven for hypothesising that these movements have penetrated police forces  Similar police indulgence of Muslim attacks in London  accompanied by the waving of Pakistani and Turkish flags  has been shown during the several occasions when the Indian High Commission has been attacked  While successive Home Secretaries then Priti Patel and now Suella Braverman might outrage about such police indifference  operational matters lie with London’s mayor Sadiq Khan  who has been in office throughout these events  In a seeming attempt to secure his return after the next mayoral election  Khan’s call for a ceasefire is an effective demand that the Israelis stop their pursuit of Hamas  He is not alone  with over 300 Muslim Labour councillors signalling in a letter that the party adopt the same approach  Some have resigned from the party  Couched in the form of a plea from a ‘community’ they ostensibly represent  one cannot help thinking that this is international Islamism at play  Much of the culturally emasculated political Right points to the failure of multiculturalism as the explanation for both Leicester and the events in October 2023  If multiculturalism entails a broad policy of tolerance of different cultures and creeds  Britain and its diverse society have largely lived up to the ideal  It is Muslims who have outstandingly failed to do so  It is a pointless expectation for all immigrants to live up to the ideals of liberalism of which the political Right has now become the defender  However  at least the varied segments of British society have not undermined the fabric of liberalism by open hostility to it  Again  it is the Muslim exception that stands out as the most vociferously hostile to liberalism  It is unfortunate that Braverman did not make this clear when she went on to blame recent immigrants  which can be read as referring to Hindus  for last year’s events in Leicester  If immigration has been instrumental in helping undermine multiculturalism  it isn’t all immigration but the specific sort from which the now mainstreamed Islamic fundamentalist movements derive support and following  Neither their advocacy of the submission of non Muslims to Muslim dominance nor any other aspect of Islamification has any cognitive appeal  and it is thus expectedly imposed through violence  Some of the causes are to be found in Mark Curtis’s Secret Affairs  Britain’s Collusion with Radical Islam  where the author vividly describes the extent of the United Kingdom’s encouragement of Islamic fundamentalist movements  The chickens have now come home to roost  but you do not find those chiming into the chorus of international Islamism complaining or resigning on those grounds  Years of intelligence gathering and academic research  hugely costly anti radicalisation policies  and several laws on terrorism have strangely not controlled the problem  Largely dominant in all cultural institutions such as the media and universities  the collusive and deliberate blindness of the Left has been noted already  Besides  this is not the old Left  but a new social justice Left that turns blindness into an article of faith  debilitating Britain’s ability to respond to jihadism  This leaves Britain with no clear way out and a bleak future  The obvious targets of jihadist violence  prominently among which are Jews and Hindus  will have to be ever more afraid about the safety and security  which they have largely been able to take for granted until recently The writer is a reader in Culture and Law at Queen Mary  University of London  Views are personal   India’s abstention at the UN General Assembly on the Jordanian sponsored resolution over the weekend  seeking a humanitarian pause in the Israeli bombardment of Gaza  continues to reverberate  The country seems largely divided between the realist school – which believes that might is right  a view led by the US Israel alliance – and those who pursue the moral high ground  which remains aghast at the unprecedented number of deaths in the conflict so far  On the face of it  the Modi government seems to have taken the safe way out by abstaining and not voting against the resolution  Just like the US and Israel did  despite the fact that PM Modi had tweeted his and India’s “solidarity with Israel” within hours of the 7 October massacre  But the truth is that in the UN system  abstentions don’t count  So the resolution  even if it was a non binding one  which means that no country would be forced to follow through  and which passed with a two thirds majority  is really a toothless one  Even if as many as 120 countries voted in favour  14 against  and 45 abstained  India  as is known by now  was the only country in South Asia that abstained  Bangladesh  the Maldives  and Pakistan co sponsored the resolution  Even Bhutan  considered to be India’s closest friend  voted in favour France broke from its Western allies by voting in favour of the UN resolution  China and Russia  expectedly  did likewise  The UK  America’s closest ally  abstained – as did Germany and Japan  The US was the only permanent member of the Security Council that voted alongside Israel  Look who else voted in favour  Nauru  Fiji  Guatemala  Micronesia  Marshall Islands  Croatia  Czechia  Austria  Papua New Guinea  Tonga  Paraguay  Hungary and Israel  Clearly  the US is so aware of its own power that it cares little for global opinion  It’s also really interesting that the Democratic Party  led by US President Joe Biden  seems okay with watching the slaughter of innocent people in Gaza  there isn’t much that differentiates them from the Republicans  What a far cry from the tears it has shed in the past over human rights violations across the world  including in Jammu and Kashmir  Clearly  the power of the US Jewish lobby that controls the levers of politics and finance is in full play Also read  India’s support for Israel is the right choice  But taking a middle path would be wiser To reiterate  this was not a binding UN resolution  so no party will be censured  The realist school also believes the UN is a paper tiger  so who cares even if most of the world voted in favour of the humanitarian pause for Palestine  Moreover  this lot believes that India’s abstention was the right thing to do  not just because it was in line with its several abstentions on the Russian invasion of Ukraine last year  but because the resolution didn’t name Hamas as the perpetrator of the 7 October violence  As the Indian deputy permanent representative at the UN pointed out in her explanation of the vote  India remains anguished about the continuing loss of life  but couldn’t possibly vote in favour of a pause because it didn’t go far enough in condemning the “malignancy” of “terrorism ” Talk about twisting your foreign policy through hoops  Moreover  the realist school misses the larger point  which is that this is a moment in history when it is important to stand up and be counted on pushing for the end of war  Like most of the world has done Certainly  the Modi government has shifted much closer to Israel in the last five years  In 2018  India voted along with 120 countries in the UN deploring Israel for using “excessive  disproportionate and indiscriminate force” against Palestinians  It condemned the “use of live ammunition against civilian protestors  including children…” So  what has changed in the last five years  Why is the Modi government much more willing to be seen today as standing in favour of Israel than it was earlier  and as a result  willing to stomach the death of more than 8 000 Palestinians so far  Clearly  the “abstention” in 2023 is a change from “voting along the resolution” in 2018  Certainly  the Modi government made a considered decision when it “abstained”  but refused to vote “along with” Israel and the US this weekend  Despite his “solidarity” tweet for Israel within hours of the 7 October Hamas attack  the PM understands that Tel Aviv’s horrifyingly disproportionate response isn’t going down well with folks at home – not just the Congress party  That is why Modi  one day after the vote  called the Egyptian president Abdel Fatah El Sisi  whose response to the crisis will be instrumental in how things evolve India also understands well the hypocrisy of the Arab world  If they were so concerned about the fate of the Palestinians  they would have surely done something   they had 75 years to fix the problem  Just in the last couple of years  the UAE has kissed and made up with Israel  and the Saudis were also about to do so  Moreover  the Gulf monarchies have such total control over their restive streets that there is no danger of them rising up against the wishes of their respective sheikhs – no wonder the Americans have used these sheikhs to create alphabets soup that most recently spell I2U2  India Israel US UAE  or IMEEC  India Middle East Europe Economic Corridor   Much more worrying is the unhappiness of people in Middle Eastern nations like Egypt  Tunisia  Jordan  and Lebanon against their autocratic rulers  Never forget it was a vegetable seller in Tunisia who lit the spark that snowballed into the Arab Spring more than a decade ago  Of course  these Arab elites have  over the decades  cruelly and successfully put down those democratic protests and demonstrations  citing the fear of Right wing Islamist radical organisations like the Muslim Brotherhood  thus keeping themselves in power  Still  the burgeoning death toll in Palestine these past few days is moving the stoniest of hearts  Israel has gone ahead with its invasion of Gaza  but it’s not clear how this will unfold – remember that Hamas still holds Israeli hostages as crucial leverage It now seems the UAE is contemplating another resolution at the UN  this time a binding one  No matter  The realist school is right to the extent that few care about these speeches from the podium of a fancy UN auditorium  But when horrifying images of dying and dead men  women  and children fill your screens night after night after night across the world – something will have to give  something should give  The realist school is probably right  Tomorrow’s another day  With another resolution at the UN and an emergency meeting of Arab states next week  little is likely to change  The question remains  Did India do the right thing by abstaining on the Jordanian sponsored resolution   United Nations  Terrorism is a “malignancy” and knows no borders  nationality or race and the world should not buy into any justification of terror acts  India has told the UN General Assembly as it abstained on a resolution on the Israel Hamas conflict  India on Friday abstained in the UN General Assembly on a Jordanian drafted resolution titled ‘Protection of civilians and upholding legal and humanitarian obligations’ that called for an immediate humanitarian truce in the Israel Hamas conflict and unhindered humanitarian access in the Gaza strip  The 193 member General Assembly adopted the resolution that called for an immediate  durable and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities  The resolution  which garnered 121 votes in favour  44 abstentions and 14 member states voting against it  also demanded the immediate  continuous  sufficient and unhindered provision of essential goods and services to civilians throughout the Gaza Strip India’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Yojna Patel  in Explanation of Vote here said in a world where differences and disputes should be resolved by dialogue  this august body should be deeply concerned at recourse to violence  “That too  when it happens on a scale and intensity that is an affront to basic human values ” Patel said  Patel said that violence as a means to achieve political objectives damages indiscriminately and does not pave the way for any durable solutions  Describing the terror attacks in Israel on October 7 as shocking  Patel said they deserve condemnation  India’s explanation of the vote did not mention Hamas “Terrorism is a malignancy and knows no borders  nationality or race  The world should not buy into any justification of terror acts  Let us keep aside differences  unite and adopt a zero tolerance approach to terrorism ” she said  India expressed hope that the deliberations of the General Assembly will “send a clear message against terror and violence and expand prospects for diplomacy and dialogue while addressing the humanitarian crisis that confronts us ” Patel said India is “deeply concerned” at the deteriorating security situation and astounding loss of civilian lives in the ongoing conflict  “The escalation of hostilities in the region will only exacerbate the humanitarian crisis  It is necessary for all parties to display the utmost responsibility ” she said  India also called for the “immediate and unconditional release” of the hostages  Earlier  Iraq had abstained on the resolution but later changed its vote to a yes citing “a technical problem” at the time of voting  Countries voting against the resolution included Israel and the US  China  France  and Russia voted in favour of the resolution while Canada  Germany  Japan  Ukraine and the UK abstained The resolution called for immediate  full  sustained  safe and unhindered humanitarian access for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and other United Nations humanitarian agencies and their implementing partners  the International Committee of the Red Cross and all other humanitarian organisations upholding humanitarian principles and delivering urgent assistance to civilians in the Gaza Strip  It encourages the establishment of humanitarian corridors and other initiatives to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to civilians and welcomes efforts on this  Patel stressed that casualties in the ongoing conflict in Gaza are a telling  serious and continuing concern and it is civilians  especially women and children  who are paying with their lives  “This humanitarian crisis needs to be addressed ” Patel said  welcoming the international community’s de escalation efforts and delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza She noted that India too has contributed to this effort  India has sent 38 tons of humanitarian goods  including medicines and equipment to the people of Palestine  Patel reiterated that India has always supported a negotiated two state solution to the Israel Palestine issue  leading to the establishment of a sovereign  independent and viable state of Palestine  living within secure and recognised borders  side by side in peace with Israel  “For this  we urge the parties to de escalate  eschew violence and work towards creating conditions for an early resumption of direct peace negotiations ” she said  The Jordanian drafted resolution did not make any mention of the militant group Hamas Before the General Assembly voted on the resolution  the 193 member body considered an amendment proposed by Canada and co sponsored by the US to the text  The amendment proposed by Canada asked for inserting a paragraph in the resolution that would state that the General Assembly “Unequivocally rejects and condemns the terrorist attacks by Hamas that took place in Israel starting on 7 October 2023 and the taking of hostages  demands the safety  well being and humane treatment of the hostages in compliance with international law  and calls for their immediate and unconditional release ” India voted in favour of the amendment  along with 87 other nations  while 55 member states voted against and 23 abstentions  The draft amendment could not be adopted  having failed to obtain a 2 3rd majority of members present and voting  The adopted resolution called for the rescinding of the order by “Israel  the occupying Power”  for Palestinian civilians and United Nations staff  as well as humanitarian and medical workers  to evacuate all areas in the Gaza Strip north of the Wadi Gaza and relocate to southern Gaza It also called for the immediate and unconditional release of all civilians who are being illegally held captive  demanding their safety  well being and humane treatment in compliance with international law  It emphasised the importance of preventing further destabilisation and escalation of violence in the region and in this regard called upon all parties to exercise maximum restraint and upon all those with influence on them to work toward this objective  Meanwhile  UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres voiced deep concern at the humanitarian system in Gaza  saying it is facing a total collapse with unimaginable consequences for more than 2 million civilians  Guterres noted that about 500 trucks per day were crossing into Gaza before the hostilities began but in recent days  an average of only 12 trucks per day have entered  despite needs being far greater than at any time before  Further  the supplies that have trickled in do not include fuel for United Nations operations “Given the desperate and dramatic situation  the United Nations will not be able to continue to deliver inside Gaza without an immediate and fundamental shift in how aid is going in ” Guterres said  He added that the verification system for the movement of goods through the Rafah crossing must be adjusted to allow many more trucks to enter Gaza without delay  Guterres underscored that life saving humanitarian aid – food  water  medicine  fuel – must be allowed to reach all civilians swiftly  safely and at scale  “Misery is growing by the minute  Without a fundamental change  the people of Gaza will face an unprecedented avalanche of human suffering ” the UN chief said   Reuters  –     The war between Israel and Hamas  which stormed Israeli towns and kibbutzes bordering Gaza in a shock attack on Oct  7  is the latest in seven decades of conflict between Israelis and Palestinians that has destabilised the wider Middle East  In Hamas’ rampage  some 1 400 Israelis  mainly civilians  were killed and 229 taken hostage  In response  Israel hammered Gaza with air strikes before troops and tanks poured into the small coastal enclave in a ground assault expected to meet fierce resistance from Hamas and other Islamist militants  Medical authorities in Hamas run Gaza said on Monday that 8 306 people – including 3 457 minors – had been killed in the enclave  WHAT ARE THE ORIGINS OF THE CONFLICT  The intractable conflict pits Israeli demands for security in what it has long regarded as a hostile Middle East against Palestinian aspirations for a state of their own Israel’s founding father David Ben Gurion proclaimed the modern State of Israel on May 14  1948  establishing a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution and seeking a national home on land to which they cite deep ties dating to antiquity  Palestinians lament Israel’s creation as the Nakba  or catastrophe  that resulted in their mass dispossession and blocked their own dreams of statehood  In the war that followed  some 700 000 Palestinians  half the Arab population of what was British ruled Palestine  fled or were driven from their homes  ending up in Jordan  Lebanon and Syria as well as in Gaza  the West Bank and East Jerusalem  Israel  a close U S  ally  contests the assertion that it drove Palestinians from their homes and points out it was attacked by five Arab states the day after its creation  Armistice agreements halted the fighting in 1949 but there was no formal peace Palestinians who stayed put in the war  and their descendants  today make up about 20% of Israel’s population  WHAT MAJOR WARS HAVE BEEN FOUGHT SINCE THEN  In 1967  Israel made a pre emptive strike against Egypt and Syria  launching the Six Day War  Israel captured the West Bank and Arab East Jerusalem from Jordan and the Golan Heights from Syria and occupied them ever since  In 1973  Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack on Israeli positions along the Suez Canal and Golan Heights  touching off the Yom Kippur War  Israel pushed both armies back within three weeks Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 and thousands of Palestinian fighters under Yasser Arafat were evacuated by sea after a 10 week siege  In 2006  Lebanon’s Iran backed Hezbollah militants captured two Israeli soldiers in the volatile border region and Israel launched military action  triggering a six week war  In 2005 Israel unilaterally withdrew settlers and soldiers from Gaza  which it had captured from Egypt in 1967  But Gaza saw major flare ups of fighting in 2006  2008  2012  2014 and 2021 that involved Israeli air raids and Palestinian rocket fire  and sometimes also cross border incursions by either side  As well as wars  there have been two Palestinian intifadas  uprisings   in 1987 93 and again in 2000 05  The second saw waves of Hamas suicide bombings against Israelis  and Israeli tank and air strikes on Palestinian cities  WHAT ATTEMPTS HAVE THERE BEEN TO MAKE PEACE In 1979  Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty  ending 30 years of hostility  In 1993  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Arafat  the Palestine Liberation Organization leader  shook hands on the Oslo Accords on limited Palestinian autonomy  In 1994  Israel signed a peace treaty with Jordan  President Bill Clinton  Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Arafat took part in the Camp David summit in 2000  but failed to reach a final peace deal  In 2002  an Arab League plan offered Israel normal relations with all Arab countries in return for a full withdrawal from the lands it took in the 1967 Middle East war  the creation of a Palestinian state and a “just solution” for Palestinian refugees  The presentation of the plan was overshadowed by Hamas  which blew up an Israeli hotel full of Holocaust survivors during their Passover seder  Further peace efforts have been stalled since 2014  when talks failed between Israelis and Palestinians in Washington Palestinians boycotted dealings with the 2017 21 administration of U S  President Donald Trump since it reversed decades of U S  policy by refusing to endorse the two state solution – the peace formula that envisages a Palestinian state established in territory that Israel captured in 1967  WHERE DO PEACE EFFORTS STAND NOW  The administration of U S  President Joe Biden has focused on trying to secure a “grand bargain” in the Middle East that includes normalisation of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia  custodian of Islam’s two holiest shrines  The latest war is diplomatically awkward for Riyadh as well as for other Arab states  including some Gulf Arab states next to Saudi Arabia  that have signed peace deals with Israel WHAT ARE THE MAIN ISRAELI PALESTINIAN ISSUES  A two state solution  Israeli settlements on occupied land  the status of Jerusalem  agreed borders  and the fate of Palestinian refugees are at the core of the dispute  Two state solution  An agreement that would create a state for the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip alongside Israel  Hamas rejects the two state solution and is sworn to Israel’s destruction  Israel has said a Palestinian state must be demilitarized so as not to threaten its security  Settlements  Most countries deem Jewish settlements built on land Israel occupied in 1967 as illegal  Israel disputes this and cites historical and Biblical ties to the land  Continued settlement expansion is among the most contentious issues between Israel  the Palestinians and international community Jerusalem  Palestinians want East Jerusalem  which includes the walled Old City’s sites sacred to Muslims  Jews and Christians alike  to be the capital of their state  Israel says Jerusalem should remain its “indivisible and eternal” capital  Israel’s claim to Jerusalem’s eastern part is not recognised internationally  Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel’s capital  without specifying the extent of its jurisdiction in the disputed city  and moved the U S  embassy there in 2018  Refugees  Today about 5 6 million Palestinian refugees – mainly descendants of those who fled in 1948 – live in Jordan  Lebanon  Syria  the Israeli occupied West Bank and Gaza  About half of registered refugees remain stateless  according to the Palestinian foreign ministry  many living in crowded camps  Palestinians have long demanded that refugees should be allowed to return  along with millions of their descendants  Israel says any resettlement of Palestinian refugees must occur outside of its borders   Compiled by Reuters journalists  editing by Edmund Blair  Stephen Farrell and Mark Heinrich   Gaza Jerusalem  Israel said its forces fought Hamas gunmen inside the militants’ vast tunnel network beneath Gaza as a hospital director said more than 50 Palestinians were killed in an Israeli air strike on a refugee camp in the besieged enclave  As the battle inside the tiny Hamas ruled Palestinian territory intensified  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed international calls for a halt to the fighting  But U N  and other aid officials warned that a public health catastrophe was engulfing civilians in Gaza  with hospitals struggling to cope with mounting casualties and food  medicine  drinking water and fuel running short  The director of Gaza’s Indonesian Hospital told Al Jazeera that more than 50 Palestinians were killed and 150 wounded in Israeli air strikes on a densely populated area of the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military  The tunnels under the cramped enclave are a prime objective for Israel as it expands a four day old ground offensive – after three weeks of aerial bombardment – into Gaza from the north to hit Hamas in retaliation for the Islamist group’s deadly surprise attack into southern Israel on Oct  7  Some of the 240 hostages that Israel says were seized by Hamas that day are believed to be held in the tunnel complex  adding a further complication for the Israelis on top of the difficulties of fighting in an urban setting  “Over the last day  combined IDF  Israel Defence Forces  struck approximately 300 targets  including anti tank missile and rocket launch posts below shafts  as well as military compounds inside underground tunnels belonging to the Hamas terrorist organization ” an Israeli military statement said Militants responded with anti tank missiles and machine gun fire  it said  A number of militants were killed  it said  without specifying a number  Hamas said in a statement its fighters were engaging in fierce battles with Israeli ground forces  who were taking losses  “The occupation is pushing its soldiers into proud Gaza  which will always be

of Derbent on the western shore of the Caspian Sea  on an old north south trade route skirting the Caucasus mountains  Dagestan became part of the Russian empire in 1813  when Tsarist forces prised it away from Persia  Known locally as “Mountain Jews”  they speak a dialect of the Farsi or Persian language spoken in Iran to the south This fact led Soviet authorities to designate their “nationality” – or ethnicity – in passports as “Tat”  an umbrella term for Persian speaking peoples who lived in many parts of the northern slopes of the Caucasus  Derbent  a city of 120 000  is their religious and cultural centre  but has only one synagogue  Some scholars believe that the first Mountain Jews  like members of many other Jewish communities  started to emigrate to a prospective homeland in what was then Ottoman ruled Palestine as early as the 19th century  Since the easing of emigration restrictions in the later years of the Soviet Union  the bulk of Dagestan’s Jews have emigrated to Israel Rabbi Ovadia Isakov  the best known contemporary Mountain Jewish rabbi  told Russian media that 300 400 families remained in Derbent  Isakov was shot in the chest in 2013 as he got out of his car to

spokesperson Eylon Levy told CNN  “The days ahead are going to be long  they’re going to be difficult because we’re going to go after the totality of the Hamas terror and governing infrastructure inside the Gaza Strip ”  ANI   By Patricia Zengerle  Phil Stewart and Simon LewisWASHINGTON  Reuters   Two of President Joe Biden’s top advisers asked U S  lawmakers to provide billions more dollars to Israel on Tuesday at a congressional hearing interrupted repeatedly by protesters denouncing American officials for backing what they called “genocide” against Palestinians in Gaza  Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin testified to the Senate Appropriations Committee on Biden’s request for $106 billion to fund ambitious plans for Ukraine  Israel and U S  border security  Arguing that supporting U S  partners is vital to national security  Biden requested $61 4 billion for Ukraine  about half of which would be spent in the United States to replenish weapons stocks drained by previous support for Kyiv  Biden also asked for $14 3 billion for Israel  $9 billion for humanitarian relief   including for Israel and Gaza   $13 6 billion for U S  border security  $4 billion in military assistance and government financing to counter China’s regional efforts in Asia As the hearing began  a line of anti war protesters raised red stained hands in the air  Capitol police later removed them from the room after shouted slogans including  “Ceasefire now ” “Protect the children of Gaza ” and “Stop funding genocide ”  Blinken did not respond to the protesters  but when he was asked later about the possibility of a ceasefire  he said that would only help Hamas regroup  A pause  however  for humanitarian reasons can be considered  “We do believe that we have to consider things like humanitarian pauses to make sure that assistance can get to those who needed and people can be protected and get out of harm’s way ” Blinken said   U S  troops in Iraq and Syria have been attacked at least 20 times since Oct  17 by Iran backed groups  triggering U S  air strikes last week against two unoccupied arms storage facilities in Syria  But those attacks  which were meant to deter further attacks  have failed to do so  with near daily attempts to strike American forces in both countries Austin said that if such attacks do not cease  “We will respond ” Blinken said U S  support for Ukraine has made Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “a strategic debacle” and stressed the importance of both security assistance for Israel and humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza  “Without swift and sustained humanitarian relief  the conflict is much more likely to spread  suffering will grow  and Hamas and its sponsors will benefit by fashioning themselves as the saviors of the very desperation they created ” Blinken said  REPUBLICANS DIVIDED  FUNDING PATH UNSURECongress has already approved $113 billion for Ukraine since Russia invaded in February 2022  The White House has said it has less than $5 5 billion in funds to continue transferring weapons from U S  stockpiles to Ukrainian forces fighting Russia  The path forward for Biden’s latest funding plan looks uncertain  Democrats solidly back Biden’s strategy of combining Ukraine aid with support for Israel  as do many Republicans in both the Senate and House of Representatives  “We need to address all of these priorities as part of one package – because the reality is these issues are all connected  and they are all urgent ” Senate Appropriations Committee Chairperson Patty Murray said  Senator Susan Collins  the committee’s top Republican  said she would judge the funding request on whether it makes the United States more secure  But Republicans who lead the House of Representatives object to combining the two issues  joined by some party members in the Senate  Opinion polls show public support for Ukraine aid declining and many Republicans  particularly those most closely aligned with former President Donald Trump  have come out against it  With federal spending fueled by $31 4 trillion in debt  they question whether Washington should be funding Ukraine’s war with Russia  rather than backing Israel or boosting efforts to push back against a rising China  Newly elected House Speaker Mike Johnson has voted in the past against assistance for Kyiv  On Monday  he introduced a bill to provide $14 3 billion in aid to Israel by cutting funding for the Internal Revenue Service  setting up a showdown with Democrats  The House bill does not provide humanitarian aid for Gaza Biden’s support for Israel  which already receives $3 8 billion in annual U S  military assistance  has drawn criticism amid international appeals for Gaza civilians to be protected  Israel this week launched a ground offensive in the Gaza Strip as it strikes back at Islamist Hamas militants who killed 1 400 people and took at least 240 hostages in a rampage on Oct  7  Palestinian authorities say Israel’s “total siege” of Gaza since that rampage has killed more than 8 300 people  thousands of them children  and left a dire need for fuel  food and clean water  Blinken said about 400 U S  citizens and family members – about 1000 people – are stuck in Gaza and would like to get out  He said the department was working on the issue but had not yet found a way to help them leave   Reporting by Patricia Zengerle  Phil Stewart  Simon Lewis and Idrees Ali  Editing by Alistair Bell and Nick Zieminski   DOHA DUBAI  Reuters   Qatar has mediated an agreement between Egypt  Israel and Hamas  in coordination with the U S   which will allow limited evacuations from besieged Gaza  a source briefed on deal told Reuters on Wednesday  The agreement would allow foreign passport holders and some critically injured people to leave through the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza  though there is no timeline for how long it will remain open for evacuation  the source added  The deal is not linked to other issues under negotiation such as hostages held by Hamas  the Palestinian Islamist group that governs Gaza  or pauses designed to ease a humanitarian crisis in the enclave which is suffering from food  water  fuel and medical shortages  the source said  Israel sent its forces into Gaza following weeks of air bombardments in retaliation for a major attack by Iran backed Hamas on Oct 7  Hamas has told mediators it will soon release some of the 200 or so foreign captives it had seized during the attack on Israel  Abu Ubaida  the spokesperson of the group’s armed wing  al Qassam Brigades  said in a video on the Telegram app on Tuesday  He gave no further detail on the number of captives or their nationalities  Egypt has prepared a field hospital in Sheikh Zuwayed in the Sinai  according to medical sources  Ten ambulances were sent to Rafah on Tuesday in anticipation  Israel besieged Gaza after the Hamas attack  and the U N  and other aid officials have said civilians in the enclave are living in a public health catastrophe  with hospitals struggling to treat casualties as electricity supplies peter out  On Wednesday  communications and internet services were completely cut off in the enclave again  Gaza’s largest telecommunications provider Paltel said Israel has vowed to annihilate Hamas after several inconclusive wars dating back to the militant group’s 2007 takeover of Gaza  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dismissed international calls for a “humanitarian pause” in fighting to enable emergency aid deliveries to civilians    Reporting by Andrew Mills in Doha and Nafisa   Writing by Nadine Awadalla  editing by Christian Schmollinger and Jason Neely   In some ways the war in Israel and the neighbourhood is about as important as the war in Ukraine  We know that the war in Ukraine involved two superpowers and no European Western nation  big power is directly involved here  Israel  however  is an American Western enclave in Asia  The US and the Western alliance have all sworn to protecting Israel and the Israelis themselves are quite well equipped to not just fight back  but to also launch war on Hamas  which is not a state   This story will stay with us for quite some time  That’s why it’s important for me to compartmentalise what I’m going to speak about   So for today  I would say  let’s look at five questions  what happened  two  what went wrong  three  how did Hamas justify this  four  what’s the global reaction  where India stands  and five  what may happen  Now  these are five good questions Also Read  Israel is angry  Netanyahu poised for Gaza invasion  But there are limitations to military power The first question  we know what happened  All of you know what happened  Hamas invaded the Israeli mainland  These are not settlements  Israeli settlements  Jewish settlements on the West Bank  This is the Israeli mainland  Israeli mainland as Israel inherited in 1948  it is that mainland  So Gazans broke through the wall of the fence that the Israelis have built along their border with Gaza  It’s a very expensive barrier  It cost more than a billion dollars and given how small the geography is  how little the distance is  it’s a lot of money   The Gazans broke through it or came over it in hang gliders or in some cases  motorised gliders  Many came in through the tunnels that they’ve been building  And many then once they had got the breakthrough  many then drove bulldozers into the fence and broke it and came across it This came on the day of the big annual festival in Israel  Everybody was essentially asleep  And the very formidable Israeli army  the intelligence agencies  were taken by surprise   That’s what we know  Then we know that some of these glider borne terrorists reached a rave festival that was taking place  killing a lot of people there who were just dancing  enjoying themselves  They were not expecting to be attacked  Also  these attacks took place in the area of Israel where security is not that heavy because people are not expecting to be attacked in these areas  Jewish settlements on the West Bank  for example  people are armed  Not in this area  because this is the Israeli mainland  WATCH Hamas terrorists indiscriminately shoot at bathrooms during the Nova Music Festival   This just shows you that Hamas does not care who they just kill  pic twitter com Ve0u9HRLWT  Israel Defense Forces  @IDF  October 13  2023   So this is what happened  And then we know the Israelis have been retaliating since then  Now the question is what went wrong because the whole world lays such a store by Israeli intelligence  Mossad  Israeli armed forces  How could this have gone wrong  Because Israelis know that they live in a tough environment The fact is that Israelis have forever been fighting wars for their existence in the region  And  I’m not even taking you back to the 1960s or the 1950s  But say  look at the last 20 years   2006  2008  2009  2012  2014  2018  2019  2022  That is when trouble took place at Al Aqsa Mosque following which there were lots of attacks on Israeli settlements  Also Read  2 state solution for Israel Palestine  History of the idea  Netanyahu’s stance   India’s position For a country in that situation and for a country which takes pride in producing the best technology in the world for intelligence  espionage  surveillance  How did they go wrong  I’m leaning on top award winning Israeli journalist and commentator Nahum Barnea  Nahum Barnea is writing in a paper called Yedioth Ahronoth  And he says that four blunders have taken place  One is intelligence failure  Two  the border was breached  Because after all  you have this fence with all these protections  Three  how did Hamas manage to take hostages back into Gaza  how were they not stopped before that  And four  why were Israeli defence forces so slow in their reaction And then he explains  first of all  he says  intelligence ignored many warnings that existed even earlier  So he says  first of all  intelligence failure lies in the fact  not because Hamas was so clever  but because there were many indications  Just as it happened in 1973 Yom Kippur war  that there were many indications that Egyptians may be launching an attack  Israeli intelligence dismissed it as just idle training  If people are training to use hang gliders or motorised gliders  you would normally think what are they planning  right  But in this case  Israeli intelligence probably concluded that this was just idle training  This will not lead to anything  In fact  Yedioth Ahronoth article says at 3 5 billion shekels  it’s a very expensive fence  It’s sensors above it  under it  on it  and around it  The important thing is it’s an unmanned fence because you rely so much on technology and alarms  The belief is that if anybody tries to cross it  touch it  come near it  there’ll be an alarm and somebody will immediately take action  That is excellent as long as you are only seeing a threat from the odd infiltrator or a group of terrorists  maybe 4 or 10 who are trying to cross the fence and come in because even if they cross it  you can catch them somewhere  You are not prepared for large masses of people coming in on their own vehicles or bulldozers and crushing this fence  That’s what happened  That is the first two failures  the intelligence failures  the indications were there  but everybody thought it was just idle training and two  how the border was breached So Nahum Barnea also points out to the fact that so many of these people came in and the IDF seemed to be in such deep sleep and so complacent that these terrorists are walking around one of the big Israeli army tank bases as if it was their own  You’ve seen those pictures of Hamas having taken away an Israeli main battle tank  And then I quote from Nahum Barnea  “I suddenly felt like I do not live in Israel  which I am proud of  but in Somalia ” These are very strong words  So what went wrong  Second question is answered with these four failures that we just described for you  Also Read  Palestinians stuck between ‘Islamic   Jewish fundamentalists’  says Palestine activist Third question  how did Hamas justify this and motivate people  Because after all these people coming in would have known that chances of their going back alive or going back as free people are very poor  Some went back with hostages  Yes  they escaped  And for how long do they live  I don’t know because the Israelis are raining hell over Gaza now  but Hamas had a war cry and that war cry we understand from the name that they chose for this operation  ‘Operation Al Aqsa Flood’  Al Aqsa is the name of the mosque in East Jerusalem  Al Aqsa is the third holiest place for Muslims  Now Al Aqsa has been in the news over the past two years   Clashes between Israeli security forces and Palestinian Muslims break out routinely at Al Aqsa but in the last two years  2022 and 2023  in the month of Ramzan  clashes have been really bad  It was because of anger over Israeli action at Al Aqsa that Hamas was able to motivate their cadres  And that’s also one of the reasons Hamas and its operations are finding such wide support in the Islamic world  If you go to social media and you see pictures of Israelis who have been killed  who have been maimed  who have been taken as hostages  who are being beaten  dragged by their hair  women being dragged by their hair and taken as hostages  Immediately the response you get from social media from critics of Israelis that see this is what the Israeli armed forces have been doing to unarmed devout Arabs  including old women  children in Al Aqsa Mosque There is a difference of degree but when passions are hot  nobody looks at nuance  So that is how Hamas has been able to justify it to the larger support base of Palestinians across the world or the larger community of Israeli critics across the world  and also to motivate their own cadres  In our Episode 744  that was almost three years back  we had explained to you what Al Aqsa Mosque is and what is the complexity of East Jerusalem  That is when the Sheikh Jarrah riots had broken out  Now  I will once again explain this to you because Al Aqsa is so central to this  Al Aqsa is not close to where Gaza is  In fact  I will share with you a map that my colleagues have drawn that tells you the map of Israel where Gaza is located and the respective range of many missiles that Hamas has  This also tells you where East Jerusalem is  So Al Aqsa is located there  Jerusalem was divided in 1948  In 1948  there was a war between the Jewish settlers who were coming in at that point  mostly from Europe because they were escaping the Holocaust and they had been promised a country of their own  So at the conclusion of that war  Jerusalem was divided  West Jerusalem remained with the Israelis  East Jerusalem was in a kind of mixed control  It was until 1967 mostly not in Israeli control  In the six day war of 1967  Israelis went and took over East Jerusalem  But the status of East Jerusalem still remains uncertain  Al Aqsa Mosque  in a way means the last mosque or the most distant mosque  The story is the Prophet started from the holy mosques of Mecca and Medina  he came as far as Jerusalem and it is from here  from the shrine  a very picturesque shrine   Dome of the Rock   that the Holy Prophet ascended to heaven to meet Allah on his winged  lightning horse Buraq  and came back very quickly because Allah then introduced him also to many of the other Prophets over there  including Prophet Jesus  Prophet Adam and all the others  Prophet Jacob  It is also the place which is holy to Jews because Jews think this is where Abraham offered his son in sacrifice to God  But God revealed himself and didn’t let him do it  Remember these three great faiths  Judaism  Christianity and Islam  And I’m not listing them like this in any order of importance or any order of preference  I’m only listing them chronologically because Judaism came first  then came Christianity and then Islam  For all three  this little piece of real estate is their holiest  For the Jews  their Second Temple built by Herod in 516 BCE and was destroyed in 70 CE by the Romans  stood there  It is on top of that second temple of the Jews that the Dome of the Rock is supposedly located  This is really Babri Masjid Ram Janmabhoomi multiplied several times over  And remember just walking distance  maybe if you don’t have many people in the street  just a few minutes away is the Church of the Holy Sepulchre   that’s where Jesus Christ was crucified and resurrected  So for Jews Christians and Muslims  this little patch is among their holiest places and definitely the most disputed for all three faiths The shrine itself  the Al Aqsa Mosque was built and rebuilt several times  In 8th century AD  a prayer hall was built by Umar the second  the second caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate  in the place where it was said that the Prophet prayed before he ascended to heaven  Then subsequently  Abd al Malik  who was the fifth caliph of the Umayyad Caliphate  built a larger structure there  In 1033  Dome of the Rock or the shrine of Dome of the Rock or the mosque took shape  The mosque has been there since then  And you know what happens because any time there’s festival season just as it used to happen in the days of communal riots in our country  In this place  if the month of Ramzan coincides with the Jewish week of Passover  then people go in the same area to pray  And you know who has the state power  It’s the Israelis  Clashes took place in 2022  The month of Ramzan was April 2 to May 2  Trouble had started there even earlier before Ramzan began  April 15 to April 23 was the week of Passover  Easter was April 17  I told you all three Abrahamic faiths  It’s an irony  All faiths  all three faiths are Abrahamic faiths and all three at this point are contesting this space  The Christians are not part of this trouble right now  It is entirely the Muslims and the Jews  In 2022  clashes took place  again Israeli security forces went in  There was a lot of beating  use of rubber bullets  etc  and then reprisals by Palestinians  Many Jewish settlements were attacked in that melee of stuff that followed after the Al Aqsa action in 2022  17 Jewish Israelis were killed Once again this year  2023  the month of Ramzan was 22 March to 20 April  Passover was 5 April to 12 April and Easter was 9 April  Trouble broke out on 15 April and pictures of the trouble went around the entire world  particularly the Muslim world  These came handy for Hamas  Also Read  High energy laser to destroy airborne targets   Iron Beam  Israel’s 5th line of aerial defence Now  fourth question  what’s the global reaction  We’ve seen that the entire Western world has condemned this unequivocally  In fact  in the Western world  nobody has said anything about what we might call ‘root causes ’ Because  you know what happens when we in India get hit by terrorists coming in from Pakistan  Somebody reminds us of ‘root causes’  You haven’t settled the Kashmir problem or you did this in Ayodhya or Babri Masjid or you did this in such and such place  We say this is nonsense  Don’t give us the ‘root causes’ theory  When 26 11 happened and Mumbai was attacked  UPA was in power  The UPA government also completely dismissed anybody who would have said what about any root causes  Just because you have a problem in Kashmir  You can’t just come anywhere  in this case Mumbai and start killing innocent people  So there is no ‘root causes’ justification But generally  the Western world is fully with Israel  Also Read  How Gaza hospital blast united Arab world against Israel amid Tel Aviv’s attempts to normalise ties That is the G7 Western Alliances reaction where support for Israel cuts across party and ideological lines  It’s in India  however  that this response remains divided  But also the interesting and important point is that India’s official reaction is exactly the same  Exactly the same as that of the Western world  which brings us to the final question  what may happen  Now  I will share with you a long 2021 article by Anthony Cordesman  who is one of the foremost and senior most strategic affairs experts sitting in Washington and is currently Emeritus Chair and Arleigh A  Burke Chair in Strategy at Center for Strategic and International Studies  CSIS   I’ve taken this paper from the CSIS website  I will share a link to the full paper with you  Please check it out  read it patiently but basically five points that he has made and I will leave it at that • Number one  he says that wars in 2006  2008 9  2012  2014  2018  2019  2022 have shown that Israeli might  Israeli armed forces are formidable but they have been unable to decisively degrade the terrorist firepower or manpower or the ability of the terrorists to strike at Israel  • Number two  Israel has an overwhelming military advantage  But in built up areas  that is neutralised because cities are unpredictable and expose the limitations of modern armies as shown by the US armed forces in Afghanistan and Iraq  Gaza  as you know  is fully built up  Also  built up areas really degrade technology because technology works when you have open ground  If you’re going from house to house  apartment to apartment  street to street  technology still helps  but it does degrade very fast  • Number three  Iron Dome  which Israel uses  is great  It’s very expensive  But the fact is that Hamas is also improving and Hamas has large quantities of these rockets  And as Joseph Stalin famously said  something like ‘quantity itself is a quality’  • Fourth point from Cordesman  stalemate is bad for all  That there should be a solution but to think that there can be an Arab Israeli deal by passing the Palestinians  it’s not going to happen  That’s unsustainable  You will have to get the Palestinians on board for any deal or any settlement  It’s not as if the Saudis and the Israelis can settle something and bury the hatchet in the Palestinians’ back  That is unsustainable  that’s not going to happen • And finally  he says  not solving this situation is not a solution as it has created four failed Palestinian states  What are these four failed Palestinian states  I will tell you from Cordesman  the first  Gaza with Hamas  second  West Bank with Palestinian Authority   Palestinian Authority and Hamas  by the way  are political rivals   third  Israeli Arabs  these are Arabs who live in Israel  The West Bank is about 3 million Palestinians  mostly Muslim  some Christian  and Gaza  a little over 2 million  And then you have Israeli Arabs  These are Arabs who live in Israel  who have the right to vote  Not all the rights that Jews have  for example  under a law passed by the Knesset  Israeli Arabs cannot criticise the Israeli State  Whereas in Israel  anybody can criticise the Palestinians  That is also from Cordesman’s paper  So it’s almost 7 million Palestinians under three different entities He says each one of these is a failed state  as is East Jerusalem  That makes it four failed states  Gaza under Hamas is a failed state  number one  Second  the West Bank and Palestinian Authority is a failed state  And then  in a most stunning conclusion he says  if this goes on  this could create Israel as a fifth failed state as its politics has declined from an effective democracy to “something beginning to approach ‘chaocracy’”  I conclude this episode with this final turn of the knife  This is the full transcript of ThePrint Cut The Clutter Episode 1325

the second time within a few days  to pledge support for the country as it continued its counter offensive against Hamas  Blinken who was in Israel on October 12 returned to the country after meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El Sisi  Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman  Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and King Abdullah II of Jordan   During his visit to Israel on October 12  Blinken held a nearly eight hour meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s war cabinet  kicking off a regional tour that included stops in five other countries  The Times of Israel reported   Meanwhile  White House National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby on Monday  local time  said that he thinks Israel is “certainly” making an effort to minimize humanitarian casualties in Gaza   While addressing a press briefing on Monday  local time   he said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has spoken about the efforts that they are making to try to avoid civilian casualties  He noted that there have been civilian casualties amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas and added that the Israel Defence Force’s goal is to go after Hamas terrorists and not after civilians  Asked whether US President Joe Biden feels that Israel abides by the rule of war  Kirby said  “Without getting into  reacting to events on the ground in real time  which we are just not going to do  this is a conversation we consistently have had with our Israeli counterparts  As you rightly know  that was part of the discussion yesterday with the prime minister  and you heard the prime minister today speaking in Tel Aviv about the efforts that they’re undertaking to try to avoid civilian casualties  and I think that they certainly are making that effort ”  “It doesn’t mean that there haven’t been civilian casualties tragically  there have been many  thousands of them  but unlike Putin in Ukraine  and unlike what Hamas did on October 7  killing civilians is not a war aim of the Israeli Defence Forces  Their war aim is to go after Hamas terrorists  terrorists I might add  that are using innocent Palestinians as human shields ” he added  John Kirby that Netanyahu brings up the issue of civilian casualties in Gaza in conversations with US President Joe Biden and that both leaders “recognize that as democracies  it’s important to abide by the law of war  to protect innocent life and to and to try to minimize civilian casualties ”  In response to a question on why Biden is repeatedly calling for fighting the war in a manner consistent with international humanitarian law  he said  “Because it is something that even the Prime Minister brings up in the conversation  They both recognize that as democracies  it’s important to abide by the law of war  to protect innocent life and to try to minimize civilian casualties  It’s not a lecturing  it’s a reminder from two leaders of two vibrant democracies  that this is what separates us from folks like Hamas ” He noted that there is not a single conversation that the US has not had with Israeli counterparts to better understand what efforts they are making to minimize civilian casualties  He said that the US is leading the effort to try to get humanitarian assistance into Gaza   “There’s not a single conversation we haven’t had with our Israeli counterparts to better understand what they’re doing to try to minimize civilian casualties and again  as friends can and friends should do with one another  to make sure that we’re on the same page about that ” he said  “And the United States is literally leading the effort to try to get humanitarian assistance into Gaza and if it wasn’t  quite frankly  for American leadership  I don’t think you’d see in fact  I know you wouldn’t see the increase of the aid getting in  Again  we know that there’s a lot that needs to be done  But  it’s because of the American leadership on the ground and American convening power that we are able to get that aid in and …We are really working very hard at this  Every single innocent life lost is a tragedy  Everyone whether it is a Palestinian life lost or an Israeli life lost  everyone should be prevented  There is no reason for these families to keep grieving and we are going to keep doing everything we can to work with Israeli counterparts on the minimisation of civilian casualties ” he added   The conflict in Gaza escalated after the October 7 attack by Hamas  Israel has vowed to destroy the military capabilities of Hamas while making efforts to minimise civilian casualties  The US has condemned Hamas’s action and backed Israel’s right to defend itself  Earlier in October  US President Joe Biden also visited Israel to show support for Israel   ANI

collateral damage in competition between great powers”   Guterres made these remarks during his address to Nepal’s parliament   The United Nations Secretary General also spoke on the ongoing conflict in the Middle East  acknowledging that despite being thousands of miles away  Nepali citizens were among the victims of Hamas’ brutal attacks in Israel   He extended his condolences to the families of the 10 Nepalese students who lost their lives during an attack by Hamas militants in Israel and expressed his best wishes for the safe return of Bipin Joshi  a student who is currently missing  “As geopolitical tensions rise  global divisions are becoming deeper and more dangerous  Smaller countries fear becoming collateral damage in competition between great powers ” Guterres said   Lauding Nepal’s peace process  the General Secretary said  “Your country has successfully calmed the storms of conflict and moved from war to peace  A process the United Nations has been proud to support”   “This small country has made an outsized contribution to international peace…you are preparing the final stages of your peace process – healing the wounds of war through transitional justice  A process that must help to bring peace to victims  families and communities haunted by questions  and scarred by injustice  and help put the past to rest ” he noted   The UN chief underscored the need to implement the transitional justice mechanism saying  “Transitional justice can play a vital role in securing lasting peace ” Over 17 000 people were killed and thousands were displaced  mostly throughout rural Nepal  during the armed Maoist movement in Nepal that lasted from 1996 to 2006  The conflict began on February 1996  when the CPN  Maoist  initiated an insurgency to overthrow the Nepali monarchy and establish a people’s republic  The revolution ended with the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Accord on November 2006   Emphasising Nepal’s commitment to global peace and security  Guterres pointed out that the Himalayan nation is the second largest contributor of troops to United Nations missions worldwide   India has been the largest troop contributor to UN missions since its inception   Nepal  the UN chief said  “is a promoter of peace  a champion of multilateralism  and a staunch supporter of sustainable development and climate action”  Underlining the disastrous impact of global warming  Guterres said  “Glaciers are melting at records…The effect is devastating  Swollen lakes bursting  rivers and seas rising  cultures threatened  And mountain sides exposed  inflaming the risk of rock slides  landslides and avalanche ” He said the world must act now to protect people on the frontline and to limit global temperature rise to 1 5 degrees Celsius  The UN chief also appealed to the international community to donate funding to help build resilience in effected communities   As climate catastrophe is accelerating with a deadly force  the world could learn much from Nepal in responding to these crises  Guterres said   He also recognised Nepal’s unique position  nestled between two major powers  India and China   and commended the nation for forging its own path to safeguard sovereignty and independence   Guterres also underscored the need for reform in the United Nations  including the Security Council  “Developing countries must have far greater representation in international institutions ” he said  adding  “I have called for reform of the outdated United Nations Security Council ” Guterres said he “has proposed measures to reform the global financial architecture – so that it better represents developing countries and responds to their needs”   He expressed the UN’s commitment to support Nepal’s graduation from Least Developed Country  LDC  status  underlining that this transition is imminent   During his visit to Nepal  which began on Saturday  Guterres met with President Ramchandra Poudel and Prime Minister

Israel Hamas conflict  including expansion of ground operations by the Israel army  asserting that international humanitarian law is not an a la carte menu and cannot be applied selectively and all parties must abide by it  The UN chief reiterated his call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and for unimpeded humanitarian access to be granted consistently  safely and to scale in order to meet the urgent needs created by the catastrophe unfolding in Gaza  “I am deeply alarmed by the intensification of the conflict between Israel and Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups in Gaza  This includes the expansion of ground operations by the Israel Defence Forces accompanied by intense air strikes  and the continued rocket fire towards Israel from Gaza ” Guterres said in a statement on the situation in Gaza  “I remain deeply concerned about the risk of a dangerous escalation beyond Gaza and urge all leaders to exercise utmost restraint to avoid a wider conflagration ” said Guterres  who is currently in Nepal on an official visit The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs  OCHA  said that on October 30  significant Israeli ground operations within Gaza continued for the fourth consecutive day  alongside intense bombardments  A total of 304 Palestinians were killed in Gaza on October 29  according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza  This brings the cumulative fatality toll reported in Gaza since the start of hostilities to 8 309  of whom 70 per cent are said to be children and women  OCHA said  Guterres added that civilians have borne the brunt of the current fighting from the outset  Protection of civilians on both sides is paramount and must be respected at all times  “International humanitarian law establishes clear rules that cannot be ignored  It is not an a la carte menu and cannot be applied selectively  All parties must abide by it  including the principles of distinction  proportionality  and precaution ” Guterres said He voiced concern that with too many Israeli and Palestinian lives already lost  this escalation only increases the immense suffering of civilians  OCHA noted that Palestinian armed groups’ indiscriminate rocket firing towards Israeli population continued over the past 24 hours  with no fatalities reported  Overall  about 1 400 Israelis and foreign nationals have been killed in Israel  according to the Israeli authorities  the vast majority on October 7 when the current conflict started after Hamas’ attack on Israel  According to the Israeli authorities  238 people are held captive in Gaza  including Israelis and foreign nationals  Guterres also voiced concern at the level of humanitarian assistance that has been allowed into Gaza up to this point  describing it as “completely inadequate and not commensurate with the needs of people in Gaza  compounding the humanitarian tragedy ” On October 30  a total of 26 trucks carrying humanitarian supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt  OCHA noted that while the increase in the volume of aid entering Gaza during the past two days is welcome  it said current amounts are a fraction of what is needed to prevent further deterioration in the already dire humanitarian situation  including civil unrest Guterres repeated his “utter condemnation” of the acts of terror perpetrated by Hamas on October 7  “There is never any justification for the killing  injuring and abduction of civilians ” Guterres said  adding that he appeals for the immediate and unconditional release of those civilians held hostage by Hamas  He also condemned the killing of civilians in Gaza and said he is dismayed by reports that two thirds of those who have been killed are women and children  Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths told the UN Security Council that the deliveries into Gaza via the Rafah border are a “drop in the ocean” compared to the vast scale of needs  Guterres also mourned and honoured the United Nations colleagues who have tragically been killed in the bombardment of Gaza over the past three weeks OCHA said that as of October 30  more than 1 4 million people in Gaza were internally displaced  with nearly 672 000 sheltering in 150 United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East  UNRWA  facilities  The average number of internally displaced persons per shelter is over three times their intended capacity  PTI YAS ZH ZH ZH  New Delhi  The word ‘Israel’ appears to have been scrubbed from online digital maps maintained by Chinese companies Baidu and Alibaba   After The Wall Street Journal reported this late Monday  ThePrint accessed these platforms Tuesday and verified that this remained the case  In the case of Baidu  the border lines between Israel and the Palestinian territories   the West Bank and Gaza   are clearly demarcated  as are major cities like Jerusalem and Tel Aviv  However  no names are given to mark Israel or the Palestinian territories as a whole  although a search for the term “Israel” in Mandarin directs to a zoomed out version of the entire Israel Palestine region   Alibaba’s Amap  on the other hand  is far vaguer in its presentation of the region  with the territory on the map just appearing as a blank space  Neither are the borderlines between Israeli territory  the West Bank and Gaza marked  nor do any names of urban areas located within these territories show up  A search for the term “Israel” in Mandarin redirects to Israeli consular services in China  The Journal’s report added that this ambiguous removal of the country labels on the maps “matches Beijing’s vague diplomacy in the region and contrasts with its attentiveness to maps generally…China’s government has over the years cried foul and levied fines over maps published elsewhere online  such as on hotel websites  for failing to strictly adhere to Beijing’s territorial claims  like leaving off a nine dotted line stretching around the South China Sea that isn’t internationally recognised ” China historically supported the Palestinian cause and a two state solution  having supplied arms to the Palestine Liberation Organization  but has since evolved to become a significant trading partner with Israel today   However  China’s initial statement on the outbreak of the Israel Hamas war was controversial in its lack of direct condemnation of Hamas’ attack on Israeli civilians on 7 October   “The recurrence of the conflict shows once again that the protracted standstill of the peace process cannot go on  The fundamental way out of the conflict lies in implementing the two state solution and establishing an independent State of Palestine  The international community needs to act with greater urgency  step up input into the Palestinian question  facilitate the early resumption of peace talks between Palestine and Israel  and find a way to bring about enduring peace ” the statement reads  China’s foreign minister Wang Yi has since said that every country has the right to self defence  while also asserting that Israel’s retaliatory actions on Gaza since the Hamas attack had gone well beyond the scope of self defence  Also read  China has a big advantage in Gaza war it can influence Iran  New Delhi  This year  Durga Puja did not bring joy to Joyanta Karmoker  As neighbourhood Hindus came to wish him Shubho Bijoya and his social media filled with greetings  the 27 year old activist recounts the attacks on Durga idols and puja pandals across Bangladesh  The ruling party Awami League  however  has gone to town claiming it was all peaceful this year  Between these competing claims hangs Bangladesh’s fragile social peace where the Hindu minority has been increasingly pushed into a corner of low expectations and gratitude in recent years  It’s in these times that Karmoker looks at Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi with hope and admiration  He is one of Bangladesh’s biggest Modi fans and a chronicler of injustices  “Hindus were not killed this year during Durga Puja  Nor did murderous Islamist mobs attack puja pandals in front of TV cameras  But hate has been so normalised that we ignore the fact that in several villages and towns  Durga idols were broken  A man was caught red handed trying to put copies of the Quran inside puja pandals and create a situation like 2021 ” the Hindu rights activist tells ThePrint over phone from Patuakhali village in Barisal district  Today  Karmoker uses social media to keep a record of anti Hindu violence in Bangladesh  not just during Durga Puja but throughout the year  as well as put up stories and accounts of survivors because he says mainstream media often doesn’t  It is a hate tracker of sorts  he says  for anyone who wants to know how difficult it can get for a practising Hindu in Muslim majority Bangladesh There was a time when Karmoker would post information on any attack on Hindus in Bangladesh that he got to know about  The draconian Digital Security Act has made him cautious  His timeline is filled with posts on Hindu civilisational ethos and heritage  In a recent post on Facebook  he talks about shastra puja and the need for Hindus to learn self defence  On Twitter  Karmoker follows Indian influencers from the Hindu right  He retweets regularly  Karmoker’s voice wavers as he remembers how in 2021  a copy of the Quran was placed at the feet of Hanuman in a puja pandal in Cumilla district  which led to attacks on Hindus across Bangladesh  resulting in the killing of four devotees and injuries to several others  “2021 Durga Puja made international headlines  2023 attacks were not covered even by the local press  Few talk about attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh unless they happen on a large scale  I do my bit by writing Facebook posts and tweeting ” he says  In today’s secular Bangladesh  religious freedoms appear conditional as the government treads a fine line  mindful of not upsetting the majority  The Islamic Foundation  a government religious agency  reportedly sent directives asking authorities to “stop or limit Durga Puja rituals” during namaz timings  The puja celebrations involve playing of drums throughout the day  Also read  The safest place for Hindus in Bangladesh   Jagannath Hall  Dhaka UniversityThe idea to maintain a record of attacks on Hindus came early to Karmoker  A childhood incident made him realise if Hindus do not speak up for themselves  no one else will  When his father  a village goldsmith  was picked up by the police and harassed over what Karmoker says was a bogus allegation of a business deal gone wrong  there was no one to stand by him  Growing up  he saw the country of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman that promised land for citizens of all faiths discriminate against Hindus and other religious minorities  Karmoker also tries to reach wherever there is violence against Hindus  “I do not have a job  The family income is meagre and so are my resources  But I helped survivors of anti Hindu violence in Rangpur in 2021 with whatever donations I could crowdfund  Their shops and huts were gutted  We helped rebuild their lives ” he says  Karmoker does his social work alone  He says being part of an organisation means losing the freedom to do what he thinks is right  Organisations often have their priorities and politics  while his work is for any Hindu in need  Friends in his village and outside  whom he refuses to name for reasons of safety  help him with funds to aid survivors of attacks Karmoker is not part of any association  Deliberately so  he says  as associations tend to become political in no time  “They sing the song that is given to them  Like almost no one will tell you there were attacks on Durga pandals this year ” he says  Avijit Majumder Hridoy  a Bangladeshi journalist from Pirojpur district who works for the Bengali TV news channel Kolkata TV  claims to have seen broken idols inside a pandal at Tambulkhana Bazaar in Faridpur this year  “The head of the idol of Lord Ganesh  both hands of the Laxmi idol and Durga idol’s arms were broken  Durga idol’s fingers were taken off  The same fingers that hold weapons to slay the demon ” Hridoy tells ThePrint  The journalist claims this happened just before Durga Puja celebrations began and the pandal was left unguarded  There were at least seven such alleged incidents of breaking of idols across Bangladesh  says Karmoker  but mainstream media in the country have not covered them  “Displaying Hindu religious symbolism is fraught with danger in today’s Bangladesh  Be it Durga puja celebrations or simply wearing sindoor as a Hindu married woman  you can come under attack anywhere at any time ” he says  Karmoker’s Modi bhakti  devotion  has turned some friends and strangers into staunch critics  He says it amazes him that while India and Bangladesh share friendly relations  putting up posts supporting the Indian PM gets him into trouble in Bangladesh “I have been called an RSS agent  an Indian agent and whatnot on social media and elsewhere for being a Modi fan  I like him because here is a world leader who is unapologetically Hindu  someone who is proud of his roots and his civilisational ethos  Why is it a problem if a Bangladeshi Hindu becomes his fan ” asks Karmoker  Modi has enjoyed quite a rapport with Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina ever since he came to power in 2014 and has prioritised the neighbouring country to work toward resolving historical issues and strengthening trade ties that has benefitted Dhaka  However  the Indian PM isn’t popular among the Muslim majority there  His 2021 visit to the country to take part in Bangladesh’s 50th Independence Day celebrations led to protests in which 12 people died  Karmoker says a sizeable population of Hindus in Bangladesh admire Modi as a leader  There are also many Muslims in Bangladesh who look up to him  But many would not be vocal about it  knowing they would be criticised  Or worse  There is nothing wrong about being an unapologetic Hindu like Modi  says Karmoker  because Hinduism can teach the world to be truly secular and peaceful  “Looking at the crisis in Russia Ukraine or Israel Palestine  I feel the teachings of Sanatan Dharma need to spread across the world  Sanatan Dharma doesn’t teach war  It doesn’t tell you to behead women and children  It advocates universal brotherhood and peace  When religious leaders in Bangladesh abuse Hindus  I feel there is someone like Modi who stands proudly for all Hindus in the world ” says Karmoker This is not a worldview that finds takers  at least in public  among too many young Hindus in Bangladesh  Nilay Kumar Biswas  organising secretary of Bangladesh Journalism Students Council  says extremism in any religion is unacceptable to him  “Yes  there is Islamic fundamentalism  but the answer to that is not to say that any other religion is superior  We should learn to live next to each other in peace without turning supremacists ” Also read  Bangladeshi Muslim YouTuber solved oldest Durga Puja riddle  He’s a star with 1 63m subscribers Karmoker says things have been better under Sheikh Hasina  But Bangladeshi society still discriminates against Hindus  He hopes after the upcoming national elections  Bangladesh would change for the better  Karmoker says his country has made exponential progress in infrastructural development but social indices need more focussed attention  “Make Hindus a part of the growth story  A section of the Hindu population has progressed in this country but not all Hindu lives have been transformed  During Durga Puja as well as during elections  Hindu citizens live in fear of violent attacks to their lives and properties  I want my government to protect me from communalism and make me feel that I am as much a part of this country as a Muslim is ” says Karmoker  The activist says even Hindu MPs often fail to address Hindu grievances in Parliament  “I dream of a Bangladesh where at least a Hindu MP can speak free about the rights of fellow Hindus  We debate over Israel and Palestine  Let us also take a harder look at our country ” he says The Bangladesh government has come out in support of Palestine  On the streets of Dhaka  there are processions to express solidarity with Gazans in their hour of need  For himself  Karmoker wants the controversial Digital Security Act to go  The legislation makes his work extremely difficult as it gives law enforcement agencies the power to arrest anyone  search any premises  and seize any equipment without a warrant  “Journalists  civil rights activists and NGO workers have been arrested under this Act  Now imagine how tough my job is ” says Karmoker  HIs fears are not his alone  Coming into force on 1 October 2018  the law has been criticised within Bangladesh and outside for muzzling free speech on the internet  In an article published by the American think tank Carnegie Endowment for International Peace on 9 December 2021  Ali Riaz  Bangladeshi American political scientist  wrote that the Act is a telltale sign of Bangladesh’s ongoing slide toward authoritarianism    Reuters  –     Authorities and civil society groups in many countries have reported a surge in antisemitism since the Oct  7 attack by Hamas on southern Israel and subsequent bombardment of the Gaza Strip by the Israeli military  The following are details of how the surge is affecting countries  compiled by Reuters reporters around the world  UNITED STATES Jewish advocacy group the Anti Defamation League reported last week that antisemitic incidents had risen by about 400% in the two weeks following the

graffiti defacing a synagogue in Rio de Janeiro  No instances of physical threats or assaults have been reported  “We are very concerned  We have increased the security of our institutions ” said Ricardo Berkiensztat  executive president of the Jewish Federation of the State of Sao Paulo  He said he had seen comments online such as “Hitler didn’t finish  he should have finished killing Jews” BRITAIN London’s police force said there had been a 14 fold increase in incidents of antisemitism since the Oct  7 attack  The Community Security Trust  which collates reports of antisemitism in Britain  said the number of incidents in the three weeks following the attack was the highest for any three week period since it started collecting data in 1984  FRANCEInterior Minister Gerald Darmanin said on Monday that since Oct  7 there had been 819 antisemitic acts  That compares with a figure of 436 for the whole of 2022  Darmanin said there had been 414 arrests in connection with this trend  GERMANY A survey by a civil society observatory  the RIAS  found a 240% year on year increase in antisemitic incidents in the period of Oct  7 15 NETHERLANDS No official figures are available yet  but Eddo Verdoner  national coordinator for combating antisemitism  said a sharp rise had been observed and anxiety was high in the Jewish community  He said Jewish parents had reported their children had been harassed at school  with comments such as “Hamas were right” and “they should have done it earlier” directed at them  SOUTH AFRICAThe number of antisemitic incidents in October is nine times higher than the average recorded for that month over the past decade  according to David Saks  associate director of the South African Jewish Board of Deputies  In one incident  a woman who shared a link to information about a protest calling for the release of Israeli hostages being held in Gaza was abused online  including a post that said “we’ll come for her babies next”  RUSSIA After an angry crowd stormed an airport in the Dagestan region searching for Jews to harm after a plane arrived from Tel Aviv  the president of Russia’s Federation of Jewish Communities called on the authorities to harshly punish the organisers Rabbi Alexander Boroda said the airport riot “undermined the basic foundations of our multi cultural and multi national state”  CHINA No figures are available on antisemitic incidents  On Oct  13  a staff member of the Israeli embassy in Beijing was assaulted and a suspect was arrested  Chinese social media is awash with antisemitic content  including posts suggesting the Nazi Holocaust was justified and likening Jews to parasites  vampires or snakes A foreign ministry spokesperson said the law prohibited the use of the internet to propagate hate speech  but there were no discernible efforts by the authorities to curb antisemitic activity online    Reporting by Andrew MacAskill  Layli Foroudi  Julia Harte  Chen Lin  Maytaal

terrorists breached the border into Israel from the Gaza Strip  leading to casualties and the seizure of hostages  Over 8 000 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks since October 7  More than 1 400 people were killed in the Hamas attack on Israel    Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday made it clear that Israel would not agree to a ceasefire  drawing parallels to the United States’ position after the bombing of Pearl Harbor  He noted that calls for a ceasefire between Israel and Gaza are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas  While addressing a press briefing  Netanyahu said  “I want to make clear Israel’s position regarding the ceasefire  Just as the United States would not agree to a ceasefire after the bombing of Pearl Harbor  or after the terrorist attacks of 9 11  Israel will not agree to a cessation of hostilities after the horrific attacks of October 7 ”  “Calls for a ceasefire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas  to surrender to terror  to surrender to barbarism  That will not happen  Ladies and gentlemen  the Bible says that there is a time for peace and a time for war  This is a time for war  A war for a common future ” he added  He called it a turning point for nations and said that it is time for everyone to decide if they are willing to fight for a future of hope and promise or surrender to tyranny and terror  He said that Israel has been at war since October 7   Netanyahu said  “The horrors that Hamas perpetrated on October 7 remind us that we will not realize the promise of a better future unless we  the civilized world  are willing to fight the barbarians because the barbarians are ready to fight us and their goal is clear  shatter that promise and future  destroy all that we cherish and usher in a world of fear and darkness ” He further said  “This is a turning point  a turning point for leaders and nations  It is time for all of us to decide if we are willing to fight for a future of hope and promise or surrender to tyranny and terror  Now rest assured  Israel will fight  Since October 7  Israel has been at war  Israel did not start this war  Israel did not want this war  But Israel will win this war ”  The Israel Defence Forces on Wednesday said that the aerial defence array intercepted “an aerial threat” that was identified in the Red Sea area  south of Eilat  It further said that there was no threat to civilians and no infiltration into Israeli territory was identified  Taking to X  Israel Defence Forces stated  “The IDF Aerial Defense Array intercepted an aerial threat that was identified in the area of the Red Sea  south of the city of Eilat  a short while ago  No threat was posed to civilians and no infiltration into Israeli territory was identified ”  The IDF also said that thousands of Lebanese civilians have evacuated southern Lebanon on their own in the past few weeks over their fear that Hezbollah would bring war upon them  According to IDF  funerals were being held in Shiite villages in southern Lebanon for Shiites who were sent by Nasrallah to defend Hamas in Gaza  In a post shared on X  IDF stated  Over the past few weeks  thousands of Lebanese civilians have evacuated southern Lebanon on their own initiative  out of fear that Hezbollah will bring war upon them  Funerals are being held in Shiite villages in southern Lebanon for Shias who were sent by Nasrallah to ‘defend’ Hamas ISIS in Gaza ”  ANI   New Delhi  Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Saturday expressed “shock” over New Delhi abstaining on a United Nations resolution on the Israel Hamas conflict  saying that watching in silence thousands of men  women and children in Palestine being annihilated goes against everything India has stood for  India on Friday abstained from voting in the UN General Assembly on a Jordanian drafted resolution titled ‘Protection of civilians and upholding legal and humanitarian obligations’ that called for an immediate humanitarian truce in the Israel Hamas conflict and unhindered humanitarian access in the Gaza strip  The 193 member General Assembly adopted the resolution that called for an immediate  durable and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities  In a post on X  Priyanka Gandhi quoted Mahatma Gandhi’s “an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind” to drive home her point “I am shocked and ashamed that our country has abstained from voting for a ceasefire in Gaza ” Priyanka Gandhi said  “Our country was founded on the principles of non violence and truth  principles for which our freedom fighters laid down their lives  these principles form the basis of the constitution that defines our nationhood ” she said   They represent the moral courage of India that guided its actions as a member of the international community  she added  “To refuse to take a stand and watch in silence as every law of humanity is pulverized  food  water  medical supplies  communication and power is cut off to millions of people and thousands of men  women and children in Palestine are being annihilated goes against everything our country has stood for throughout its life as a nation ” Priyanka Gandhi said  India said terrorism is a “malignancy” and knows no borders  nationality or race and the world should not buy into any justification of terror acts  as it abstained on a resolution on the Israel Hamas conflict The resolution  which garnered 121 votes in favour  44 abstentions and 14 member states voting against it  also demanded the immediate  continuous  sufficient and unhindered provision of essential goods and services to civilians throughout the Gaza Strip  According to media reports  the rising death toll in Gaza is unprecedented in the decades long Israeli Palestinian conflict   The Health Ministry in Hamas ruled Gaza said Thursday that more than 7 000 Palestinians have died in the conflict  Over 1 400 people were killed in the unprecedented attacks on Israel by Hamas on October 7  Hamas has held more than 220 people hostage in Gaza  Israel then launched retaliatory strikes which left a trail of death and destruction   New Delhi  India   October 31  ANI   As the Israel Hamas war enters its 25th day  the Ambassador of Greece to India  Dimitrios Ioannou expressed Greece’s unequivocal condemnation of Hamas and its actions  labelling it as a terrorist organisation and underscored that a solution to the Middle East war is not possible without Hamas’ dissolution   “Greece condemns in absolute terms Hamas and the killings  the crimes that have been committed and considers Hamas to be a terrorist organisation  There cannot be a solution to the Middle East conflict without the dissolution of the Hamas terrorist organisation  A solution should be advanced and implemented through political dialogue ” said the Greek envoy in an interview with ANI on Tuesday  The ongoing war between Israel and Hamas also brought to the forefront discussions about the future of the India Middle East Europe Corridor  IMEC   The Greek envoy while weighing in on this matter  emphasised that the corridor is an “absolute necessity ” to India’s economic landscape  adding it could experience some delays but may proceed without significant hindrance   Ambassador Ioannou  while speaking at an Observer Research Foundation event  also highlighted the significance of the India Middle East Corridor as an alternative to China’s Belt and Road Initiative  BRI  for the Indian economy  He stressed that this corridor  which has been in the planning stages  is deemed a necessity  “It seems to me a very peculiar thing why this idea about the economic corridor did not appear to some minds ten or five years before because it seems to me like an absolute necessity  India Middle East Corridor is an absolutely necessary alternative to China’s BRI for the Indian economy  It will be built one way or another ” said the Greek envoy at the ORF event   The Ambassador also mentioned that it could experience some delays but may proceed without significant hindrance  “And I don’t know whether it will be delayed by the unhappy events now but I think that economic necessity is the strongest motivation in international relations  So it can be a delay of one or two years or it can be no delay at all because the fact is that this is still a project on paper and we don’t know how long it will take ” he added  Greece firmly supports the concept of a two state solution and emphasises the importance of safeguarding innocent civilian lives in the region  “First  we condemn the atrocities made by Hamas  Hamas is a terrorist organisation  We would not be able to have a solution to the Israel Palestine conflict without a solution on the end of Hamas  It is a factor to play in this situation…Second  we believe in the solution of two states…The lives of innocent civilians should be saved and protected… ” said Ambassador Ioannou in an interview with ANI   In an interesting observation  Ambassador Ioannou revealed the immense popularity of Indian actress Nargis in Greece during the 1960s  The cultural connection  according to them  illustrates that India was not perceived as a distant country but was well known in Greece  “The most popular actress in Greece in the in the 60s was Nargis  I remember that my mother was drawn from the cinemas to the movies to watch the movies of Nargis  I always sing the song from Mother India  So Greeks  in many ways  for many reasons  they were very much informed about India  India was not at all such a distant country as China ” he added  Additionally  Ambassador Ioannou highlighted the substantial maritime cooperation between Greece and India  “Greece has the biggest maritime fleet in the world…If at this moment there is an Indian product delivered somewhere around the world to its final consumer  there is one chance in five that it was transported by a Greek ship  It’s the same the other way around where something is delivered at this  moment here in India coming from abroad  There is also a 1 5 chance that it was transported by the Greek fleet…That means that even without waiting for the economic corridor to be built and completed the Greek merchant fleet contributed to the development and the growth of the Indian economy  And it will continue doing so in the coming years…”  Regarding Greece’s support for India in the United Nations Security Council  UNSC   Ambassador Ioannou reaffirmed Greece’s backing  emphasising the necessity of India’s participation in the UNSC due to its status as the most populous country  which holds considerable influence in international diplomacy  He said  “From the very first moment Greece has been supportive and we will support it because it is absolutely necessary that the most populous country be a part of the Security Council  India is a factor in international diplomacy…” He wrapped up by underscoring the promising development of India Greece relations following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Greece  “After the visit of PM Modi to Greece the relations of India and Greece have entered a very promising stage  They will be developing in the coming years… ” said the Greek envoy   ANI    Bhopal  Oct 29  PTI  BJP national spokesman Sudhanshu Trivedi on Sunday said central agencies will investigate the alleged virtual participation of a Hamas leader in a protest programme in Kerala against Israel’s war with the militant outfit   Kerala BJP chief K Surendran alleged on Saturday that Hamas leader Khaled Mashal had participated virtually in the protest programme organised by an Islamist group in the southern state  Trivedi said that the Hamas leader addressed a rally virtually in Kerala from where Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is a Lok Sabha member   “The rally had been organised in Kerala  Law and order is a state subject  Now that this fact has come to light  central agencies will investigate with full caution whether the address was live or recorded  If recorded then who got this video ” Trivedi said at a press conference here The BJP leader said that this event should not be seen in “isolation” but in “coherence”   A proposal passed by the Congress Working Committee  CWC  doesn’t mention the word ‘Hamas’  he said and added that Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra tweeted about the Gaza conflict on Saturday but Hamas was missing in her post too  Trivedi said the Congress strategy is to keep one community united all the way till Palestine and keep dividing the other along the lines of “North and South  Tamil and Hindi and forward backward”  Talking about the Congress’ objection to the mentioning of ‘Ram temple’ in election campaigning in poll bound Madhya Pradesh  the BJP leader said the grand old party should clarify its stand if it has objection over “Ram” or the “temple” He said that the name of Ram is inscribed on the ‘samadhi’ of Mahatma Gandhi and Congress leaders used to visit temples during elections  In fact  seeing the completion of the Ram temple’s construction  the Congress has become desperate as it never wanted it to happen  he claimed  Elections to the 230

Rajeev Chandrasekhar for allegedly intending to disturb communal harmony and stoke unrest through his Facebook post in the aftermath of the two blasts at a Jehovah’s Witnesses convention in Kalamassery   ThePrint has seen a copy of the First Information Report  FIR  filed in the early hours of Tuesday on the complaint of a sub inspector attached to the cyber cell in Ernakulam   Sections invoked in the FIR include 153  provoking a riot  and 153A  promoting enmity between different groups  of the Indian Penal Code  IPC   besides section 120 o  of the Kerala Police Act  which deals with causing nuisance and violation of public order  “In the wake of the bomb blast in Kalamassery  in the Ernakulam district on 29 10 2023  the accused Rajeev Chandrashekhar  with the intention of disturbing the communal harmony and creating unrest posted provocative statements on his Facebook page from 29 10 2023  He posted videos and text messages about “Palestinian terrorist group Hamas” and other provocative statements on social media in an attempt to create unrest amid religious groups in Kerala and incite riots to disturb the peace ” read the FIR lodged at Ernakulam Central police station Chandrasekhar took to X  formerly Twitter  to attack the Kerala government and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi for the FIR filed against him  “So the two INDI alliance partners @RahulGandhi and @PinarayiVijayan have jointly filed a “case” against me  Two of biggest appeasers in Indian politics who shamelessly appease poisonous radical violent organizations like SDPI  PFI and Hamas  whose politics have caused radicalization over decades from J K to Punjab to Kerala and caused many innocent lives and security forces lives to be lost   trying to threaten me with a case for exposing their appeasement of Hamas ” he wrote  The development comes two days after two low intensity blasts rocked a convention centre in Kalamassery in Ernakulam district  killing three people including a minor  Chandrasekhar had visited victims of the blasts at a hospital in Kochi Monday  After the visit  he launched an attack against Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan  alleging that the Kerala government was tolerant of radical elements and radicalisation He also attacked the Congress party and said both the Left parties and Congress have a history of appeasing radical elements in Kerala  “Under CM Pinarayi Vijayan  Kerala has shown increasing tolerance towards radical elements and radicalisation  Whether it is the attempt to burn a train in Kozhikode which would have caused  if he had succeeded

stage  they are making such statements targeting a few set of people ” he said   Edited by Amrtansh Arora  Also Read  Who are Jehovah’s Witnesses  Christian group whose prayer meeting was bombed in Kerala By Humeyra Pamuk and Michael MartinaWASHINGTON  Reuters   The U S  and China have agreed to work together toward an expected summit between presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping next month  U S  officials said on Friday  following hours of meetings between Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi and senior U S  diplomats in Washington  In the first visit by a Chinese foreign minister to Washington since 2018  veteran diplomat Wang Yi also met Biden for an hour  talks that the White House described as a “good opportunity” in keeping lines of communication open between the two geopolitical rivals with deep policy differences  Wang’s meetings with U S  Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U S  national security advisor Jake Sullivan spanning over two days totaled nine hours  U S  officials said  describing these interactions as “candid and in depth”  Biden’s top aides raised Washington’s key concerns  the need to restore military to military channels between the two countries  Beijing’s actions in the East and South China Sea  Taiwan  human rights  the flow of fentanyl precursors and the cases of Americans detained in China  U S  officials said There were also “frank exchanges” between Blinken and Wang over the erupting conflict in the Middle East  The key area that appeared to show some positive momentum was toward an expected meeting between Biden and Xi on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation  APEC  summit next month in San Francisco  “We are making preparations for such a meeting ” a senior administration official  briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity  said  “Obviously  Chinese leaders often confirm publicly much closer to a trip  so I will leave it to the Chinese side to figure out if and when they make that announcement ” the official said  Wang told Biden that the objective of his visit was to help “stem the decline” in U S  China ties “with an eye on San Francisco”  without giving any details  according to a report from state news agency Xinhua “China attaches importance to the U S  side’s hopes of stabilizing and improving U S  ties with China ” Xinhua quoted Wang as saying  The Biden administration has seen direct leader level engagement with Xi as particularly important in managing tensions as it seeks to prevent relations from veering into conflict  “A big part of a potential meeting would be the two leaders sitting down together and having those conversations on strategic intent ” the official said  On Thursday  Wang told Blinken that the two countries have disagreements and need “in depth” and “comprehensive” dialogue to reduce misunderstandings and stabilize ties  “Not only should we resume dialogue  the dialogue should be in depth and comprehensive ” Wang said Wang’s three day visit follows a flurry of bilateral diplomatic engagements in recent months  largely at U S  request  aimed at salvaging what were rapidly deteriorating ties early in the year following the U S  downing of an alleged Chinese spy balloon  But some in Washington have questioned whether a slate of mostly unreciprocated U S  cabinet level official visits to Beijing over the past six months  including by Blinken  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo  played into Beijing’s hand   The trips by Yellen and Raimondo led to new bilateral economic and commercial working groups  which critics worry will only pull U S  focus away from – and possibly delay – sanctions  export controls and broader measures intended to enhance U S  competition with China   U S  officials have maintained that increased diplomacy does not mean a let up in policy  CONCERN OVER MIDDLE EAST The Israel Hamas conflict has added a fresh dynamic to the testy relationship between the superpowers  and Washington is hoping Beijing can use its influence with Iran to prevent an escalation into a wider war in the Middle East  U S  officials said the issue came up frequently during Wang’s meetings but it was unclear whether Washington was able to get Beijing on board to commit to using its influence to help contain the conflict  “We expressed our deep concern with the situation and pressed China to take a more constructive approach  and that would include  of course  their engagements with the Iranians  to urge calm ” one of the senior administration officials said China has condemned violence and attacks on civilians in the conflict  and while Wang has declared Israel’s actions “beyond the scope of self defense” he has not named Hamas in his comments  The second senior administration official said Blinken raised U S  concerns about China’s recent actions in the South China Sea and the East China Sea  including its “dangerous and unlawful obstruction” of the Philippine resupply mission to Second Thomas Shoal in the South China Sea and its unsafe intercept of a U S  aircraft    Reporting by Humeyra Pamuk  Michael Martina and Steve Holland  editing by

Saturday said it has killed Rateb Abu Sahiban  the commander of Hamas’ naval forces within the Gaza City Brigade in a targeted overnight airstrike   This operation came in response to his involvement in planning and leading a Hamas infiltration attempt via the sea on October 24  which was thwarted by Israeli Navy forces  The IDF has also shared footage of the overnight strike on social media platform  X  “The Air Force eliminated Ratab Abu Tshaiban  the commander of the naval force of the Gaza Brigade  at the end of a joint intelligence effort by the Navy  Air Force  Amman and Shin Bet  Tshaiban planned and commanded the naval penetration attempt that took place on October 24 in the area of the Zikim coast by sea ” posted Israeli Air Force on X   Meanwhile  Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari  IDF Spokesman  has stated that the military is “advancing through the stages of the war” in Gaza  with ground forces actively conducting operations in the Strip  “Infantry  armoured  engineering and artillery forces participating in the activity  accompanied by heavy  air  fire ” he says  adding  “The forces are still on the ground and continue the fighting ”  No soldiers have been hurt in the expanded ground operation  he also said  Discussing the elimination of two Hamas commanders in overnight Israeli airstrikes–the head of the terror group’s aerial forces and a naval forces commander–Hagari said  “their elimination brings good progress in the stages of the war and helps the forces fight a weaker enemy ”  While reports from Gaza are limited due to the collapse of internet and phone services during Israeli bombardment  the situation is one of total chaos in the Strip  The Times of Israel reported  A substantial bombardment in the northern Gaza Strip and difficulties in communication resulted in people searching for family members in other areas and widespread panic   The conflict in Gaza escalated after the October 7 attack by Hamas  where approximately 2 500 terrorists breached the border into Israel from the Gaza Strip  leading to casualties and the seizure of hostages  Israel has characterised its Gaza offensive as targeting Hamas’ infrastructure with the goal of eliminating the entire terror group while making efforts to minimize civilian casualties  The Times of Israel reported  At least 7 326 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks since October 7  More than 1 400 people were killed in the Hamas attack on Israel   ANI   By Stephen FarrellLONDON  Reuters  –     Gaza  which thrived in antiquity as a trade centre on the Mediterranean coast where Asia meets Africa  has been inhabited for thousands of years and fought over by Egyptian Pharaohs  Babylonians  Philistines  Macedonian Greeks  Romans  Arabs  Mongols  Crusaders  Ottomans and even Napoleon  Part of an ancient Philistine confederacy of five cities along the coastal plain  it featured in Biblical accounts  the judge Samson was held in captivity there  Alexander the Great besieged and captured Gaza City  killing the men and enslaving women and children  In Roman times  Christianity spread there and a tiny Christian community in Gaza still exists – its church was damaged during the latest round of hostilities  Arab armies invaded 1 400 years ago and brought Islam  Gaza was part of the Ottoman Empire for most of the period from the 16th century until 1917  when was it taken by British troops during World War I Over the last century Gaza passed from British to Egyptian to Israeli military rule  It is now a fenced in enclave inhabited by around 2 3 million Palestinians  most of them descendants of refugees  Here are some of the major milestones in its recent history  1948 – End of British rule As British colonial rule came to an end in Palestine in the late 1940s  violence intensified between Jews and Arabs  culminating in war between the newly created State of Israel and its Arab neighbours in May 1948 The invading Egyptian army seized a narrow coastal strip 25 miles  40 km  long from the Sinai to just south of Ashkelon  Tens of thousands of Palestinians who fled or were driven from Israel sought shelter there  tripling the population to around 200 000  1950s   1960s – Egyptian military rule Egypt held the Gaza Strip for two decades under a military governor  letting Palestinians work and study in Egypt  Armed Palestinian “fedayeen ” many of them refugees  mounted attacks into Israel  drawing reprisals  The United Nations set up a refugee agency  UNRWA  which today provides services for 1 6 million registered Palestine refugees in Gaza  as well as for Palestinians in Jordan  Lebanon  Syria  and the West Bank 1967 – War and Israeli military occupation Israel captured the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Middle East war  An Israeli census that year put Gaza’s population at 394 000  at least 60% of them refugees  With the Egyptians gone  many Gazan workers took jobs in the agriculture  construction and services industries inside Israel  to which they could then gain easy access  Israeli troops remained to administer the territory and guard settlements that Israel built in the following decades  1987 – First Palestinian uprising  Hamas formedTwenty years after the 1967 war  Palestinians launched their first intifada  or uprising  after an Israeli truck crashed into a vehicle carrying Palestinian workers in Gaza’s Jabalya refugee camp  killing four  Stone throwing protests  strikes and shutdowns followed  Seizing the angry mood  the Egypt based Muslim Brotherhood created an armed Palestinian branch  Hamas  with its power base in Gaza  Hamas  dedicated to Israel’s destruction and the restoration of Islamic rule  became a rival to Yasser Arafat’s secular Fatah party  1993 – The Oslo Accords  and Palestinian semi autonomy Israel and the Palestinians signed an historic peace accord in 1993 that led to the creation of the Palestinian Authority Under the interim deal  Palestinians were first given limited control in Gaza and Jericho in the West Bank  Arafat returned to Gaza after decades in exile  The Oslo process gave the newly created Palestinian Authority some autonomy  and envisaged statehood after five years  But that never happened  Israel accused the Palestinians of reneging on security agreements  and Palestinians were angered by continued Israeli settlement building  Hamas and another militant group  Islamic Jihad  carried out bombings to try to derail the peace process  leading Israel to impose more restrictions on movement of Palestinians out of Gaza  Hamas also picked up on growing Palestinian criticisms of corruption  nepotism and economic mismanagement by Arafat’s inner circle  2000 – Second Palestinian intifadaIn 2000  Israeli Palestinian relations sank to a new low with the outbreak of the second Palestinian intifada  It ushered in a period of suicide bombings and shooting attacks by Palestinians  and Israeli air strikes  demolitions  no go zones and curfews  One casualty was Gaza International Airport  opened in 1998  A symbol of thwarted Palestinian hopes for economic independence  it was deemed a security threat by Israel  which destroyed its radar antenna and runway a few months after the Sept  11  2001 attacks on the United States  Another casualty was Gaza’s fishing industry  a source of income for tens of thousands  Gaza’s fishing zone was reduced by Israel  citing a need to stop boats smuggling weapons  2005 – Israel evacuates its Gaza settlementsIn August 2005 Israel evacuated all its troops and settlers from Gaza  by then completely fenced off from the outside world  Palestinians tore down the abandoned buildings and infrastructure for scrap  The settlements’ removal led to greater freedom of movement within Gaza  and a “tunnel economy” boomed as armed groups  smugglers and entrepreneurs quickly dug scores of tunnels into Egypt  But the pullout also removed settlement factories  greenhouses and workshops that had employed some Gazans  2006 – Isolation under HamasIn 2006  Hamas scored a surprise victory in Palestinian parliamentary elections and then seized full control of Gaza  overthrowing forces loyal to Arafat’s successor  President Mahmoud Abbas  Much of the international community cut aid to the Palestinians in Hamas controlled areas  regarding Hamas as a terrorist organization  Israel stopped tens of thousands of Palestinian workers from entering  cutting off an important source of income  Citing security concerns  Israel and Egypt imposed tighter restrictions on the movement of people and goods through the Gaza crossings  Israeli air strikes crippled Gaza’s only power plant Ambitious Hamas plans to refocus Gaza’s economy east  away from Israel  foundered  Viewing Hamas as a threat  Egypt’s military backed leader Abdel Fattah al Sisi closed the border with Gaza and blew up most of the tunnels  Once again isolated  Gaza’s economy went into reverse  Conflict cycle Gaza’s economy has suffered repeatedly in the cycle of conflict  attack and retaliation between Israel and Palestinian militant groups  Some of the worst fighting was in 2014  when Hamas and other groups launched rockets at heartland cities in Israel  Israel carried out air strikes and artillery bombardment that devastated Gaza neighbourhoods  More than 2 100 Palestinians were killed  mostly civilians  Israel put the number of its dead at 67 soldiers and six civilians 2023 – Surprise attack While Israel was led to believe it was containing a war weary Hamas by providing economic incentives to Gazan workers  the group’s fighters were being trained and drilled in secret  On Oct 7  Hamas gunmen launched a surprise attack on Israel  rampaging through towns  killing 1 400 people  mainly civilians  and taking more than 200 hostages back to Gaza  according to Israeli figures  Israel vowed to destroy Hamas  imposing a full siege on Gaza and hammering it with air strikes  Medical authorities in Hamas run Gaza say more than 8 300 people have been killed  including more than 3 400 minors  Israeli troops backed by tanks pressed into the Palestinian enclave with a ground assault  expecting to meet opposition from Hamas and other Palestinian militants dug into a network of hundreds of kilometres of tunnels underneath Gaza   Writing by Stephen Farrell  Nidal al Mughrabi and Rosalba O’Brien  Editing by Peter Graff   Tel Aviv  Israel   October 31  ANI   Amid the country’s ongoing war with Hamas  Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called the United Nations General Assembly resolution calling for a ‘humanitarian truce’ deeply flawed   On being asked about India’s abstention in the UN vote as it did not condemn the Hamas attacks  Netanyahu responded by saying  “I think that resolution was deeply flawed and I am sorry to say that even many of our friends did not even… insist that there could be a flaw or a powerful condemnation of the horrors that were committed here…that there are horrors that no civilised country  including your country and so many others would tolerate…” “…So I hope we don’t see a repeat of any of these kinds of resolutions ” he added   Netanyahu also made it clear that Israel would not agree to a ceasefire  drawing parallels to the United States’ position after the bombing of Pearl Harbor  He noted that calls for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas  Netanyahu said  “I want to make clear Israel’s position regarding the ceasefire  Just as the United States would not agree to a ceasefire after the bombing of Pearl Harbor  or after the terrorist attacks of 9 11  Israel will not agree to a cessation of hostilities after the horrific attacks of October 7 ”  “Calls for a ceasefire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas  to surrender to terror  to surrender to barbarism  That will not happen  Ladies and gentlemen  the Bible says that there is a time for peace and a time for war  This is a time for war  A war for a common future ” he said during the press briefing  India abstained from voting on the Jordanian resolution which called for an “immediate  durable and sustained humanitarian truce” between Israeli forces and Hamas terrorists in Gaza as it did not specifically condemn the terror attack by Hamas   However  it is pertinent to note that India was in favour of the Canadian resolution which had an added clause that condemned the terrorist attacks by Hamas  The Jordanian led draft resolution was adopted by the General Assembly  with 120 votes in favour  14 against and 45 abstentions  The 45 nations that abstained from voting on the resolution included Iceland  India  Panama  Lithuania and Greece   The resolution was adopted during the UN General Assembly’s emergency special session on the Israel Palestine crisis  The UNGA also demanded “continuous  sufficient and unhindered” provision of lifesaving supplies and services for civilians trapped inside the enclave  Notably  expressing deep concerns over the deteriorating security situation and the astounding loss of civilian lives in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas  India at the UN urged both parties to “de escalate  eschew violence ”  India’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations  Yojna Patel on October 27 in her remarks at the United Nations General Assembly  UNGA  Emergency Special Session on the Israel Hamas war said  “India is deeply concerned at the deteriorating security situation and the astounding loss of civilian lives in the ongoing conflict  The escalation of hostilities in the region will only exacerbate the humanitarian crisis  It is necessary for all parties to display the utmost responsibility ” The conflict in Gaza escalated after the October 7 attack by Hamas  where about 2 500 terrorists breached the border into Israel from the Gaza Strip  leading to casualties and the seizure of hostages  Over 8 000 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks since October 7  More than 1 400 people were killed in the Hamas attack on Israel   ANI      Geneva  Switzerland   November 1  ANI   World Health Organisation Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus expressed concern on Wednesday about the situation of Israeli hostages in Gaza and further called for the immediate release of all the hostages    Taking on his social media ‘X’  Tedros stressed  “We continue to be gravely concerned about the condition of the hostages taken from  Israel on 7 October – particularly the children  women  older people  and those with health conditions who need immediate medical attention ” Adding to this  he said that the WHO “once again calls for the immediate release of all the hostages ” We continue to be gravely concerned about the condition of the hostages taken

its first successful hostage extrication since October 7  The IDF rescued an Israeli soldier who was abducted by Hamas  Meanwhile the New York Times quoting a Pentagon’s top special operations policy official  has reported that American commandos on the ground in Israel are helping locate the more than 200 hostages seized during Hamas’s cross border attacks on Oct  7    “We’re actively helping the Israelis to do a number of things ” Christopher P  Maier  an assistant secretary of defence  told a special operations conference in Washington  He said that a main task was to help Israel “identify hostages  including American hostages  It’s really our responsibility to do so ” According to the New York Times  the Pentagon has not specified as to how many US Special forces were currently deployed in Israel   Earlier as the ground operations by IDF intensified  IDF fighter jets eliminated Ibrahim Biari  Commander of Hamas’ Central Jabaliya Battalion  IDF said that Biari was one of the leaders responsible for the murderous terror attack on October 7th  The strike damaged Hamas’ command and control in the area and eliminated a large number of terrorists who were with Biari
